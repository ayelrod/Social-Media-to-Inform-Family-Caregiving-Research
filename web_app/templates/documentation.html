        <h3>Topic Modeling</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Topic Modeling was done using a process called LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), provided in the gensim and pyLDAvis libraries. 
        In order to implement LDA, we followed these steps: loading data, cleaning data, tokenizing data, training a model with the data, and analyzing the results.
        LDA outputs a specified number of topics with words that are most likely to belong to those topics. It uses conditional probability to group words from documents.
        The visualization package used, pyLDAvis, allows us to interpret the individual topucs and better understand their relationships.

        <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Sentiment Analysis was done using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer and NaiveBayesClassifier. The first step was to mark each post as positive or 
    negative. We did this by using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to get the polarity of text, which is a value from [-1, 1] with -1 being the most negative 
    and 1 being the most positive. Neutral posts (value of 0) are marked as Negative during the sentiment analysis. We also got the subjectivity of each post, 
    which is a value from [0, 1] with 0 being the most objective and 1 being the most subjective. Labeling posts as positive or negative is done using VADER 
    (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning). This model takes into account the general sentiment of a post (polarity) and the intensity of emotion. 
    The model can also understand context at a basic level when analyzing words.</p>

    <p>Once that was done, we used NLTK's Naive Bayes Classifier to observe which words are linked to negative and positive sentiments. 
    This output shows us how much more likely a word is to be associated with either a negative or positive sentiment.</p>

        <h3>Emotion Analysis</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Emotion Analysis is another form of natural language processing that aims to classify text as a specific emotion, like joy or anger, as well as the severity
        of the emotion. The Python library we used is called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/NRCLex/">NRCLex</a>. This package measures the following emotional affects: 
        <ul>
            <li>fear</li>
            <li>anger</li>
            <li>anticipation</li>
            <li>trust</li>
            <li>surprise</li>
            <li>positive</li>
            <li>negative</li>
            <li>sadness</li>
            <li>disgust</li>
            <li>joy</li>
        </ul>
        In order to visualize these results, we found the mean scores for each emotion across a set time period. We also targetted the most frequent emotions of various bodies of text to then find those most dominant.
