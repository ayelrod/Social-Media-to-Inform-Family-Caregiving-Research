She has been living in her home with my father with 24 hour care--mostly a housekeeper who has CNA training, who has been with them for over 20 years. My father has been declining over the past few weeks and is now moving to hospice. We anticipate him dying within the next day or so.  We have been bringing my mother to visit by his bedside, and while present with him she understands what is happening. However, as soon as she leaves she forgets what has happened and where he is. She is asking on an hourly basis for an explanation. Right now my brothers are staying in the home and able to answer her, but I don't know what to do after they leave. Based on what I've experienced previously with her, I don't think the housekeeper explaining it will be sufficient and anticipate multiple frequent phone calls from her, with her upset, confused, and frustrated.\u00a0  Do you have any advise or best practices we could implement in this situation? Would writing something down help? If so, any advice on what to write?\u00a0  We hope to be able to keep her in the home with the same caregivers, to cause as little additional disruption as possible.  Thanks in advance for your advice and support.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549272"},

{"date": "Friday, December 3, 2021 1:41 PM", "body": "My 87 year old dad died of covid pneumonia 2 months ago. He was mom's caregiver. She has moderate to advanced Alz. We brought her to the hospital when he passed and she was at his funeral. She really didn't grasp what was happening there, she seemed to enjoy talking with people (acted like she knew them) then asked me why we were there. Initially, I brought her to my house to stay since she could not stay in their home alone. She was obsessed with wanting to call her family (specifically her mother and father and occasionally, my dad) to pick her up and take her \"home\" to \"New Jersey.\" We live in Texas. She seemed to regress to her high school years at that point. Because she was SO unhappy at my house and wanted to go \"home\" and cried every day, we decided to take her back to her house. As I suspected, she began to ask about my dad (and stopped asking about her mom and dad); wanting to know when he would be home. We had told her he was on a business trip, or a fishing trip, or traveling, or unable to get back because of covid restrictions, etc. She then became obsessed with looking at the window for him and leaving the lights on and checking the phone and telling me \"he TOLD me he was coming back tonight\". After a few days of that, she became very upset, crying, saying that he ABANDONED her, he left without even telling her, he doesn't have the decency to even call her; he's probably with another WOMAN, and that she's not putting up with being treated like this, and she's going to LEAVE.  She then begged me to tell her the TRUTH...she said she HAD to know. So, I told her he had not abandoned her, and was not with another woman, but that he was in heaven, and we watched a video of his funeral. She cried and seemed to understand, but then said \"the minister is talking about him as if he's DEAD!\" and continued to sit in the front window and watch for dad's car to pull in. Last night, I found her in the dark in the living room, looking out the window and sobbing. She had written a note to him (she has macular degeneration and cannot SEE, but I could make out most of the words she wrote, and it broke my heart.) She said that it's clear he does not want to be with her any more and that she is so hurt, she can barely breathe.  She went to sleep with the light on in the bedroom. When she woke up this morning, she asked me where he was and I said \"he's gone\" and she said \"is he DEAD gone, or just gone? I said \"dead gone\" and did not get a reaction. A few minutes later she commented how she can't believe he has not called just to say hi and ask how she's doing and she's SO HURT and not going to put up with being treated like this.\u00a0  It's such a TOUGH situation...no matter what is said, she spends her days being sad and miserable and fretting. I'm an only child, recently retired, and have spent all my energy for the past year taking care of them. I'm beginning to think she would be happier in a memory care facility with other people to interact with. Before we came back to her house, she talked about finding a boyfriend, getting her own place, getting a job, etc. Of course, she can't get her own place or a job or drive or anything of the kind. I just nodded and told her we would work something out. She is so sad and lonely...even though I'm with her 24/7, she's not happy.  NOTE: When she gets upset about dad, I tell her he's NOT with another woman, and he has no control over the situation and not intentionally trying to hurt her, but that does not ease her pain. Yesterday, she said we need to call the police and report him as a missing person.\u00a0  I need some words of wisdom, and lots of prayers for guidance to do the right thing.\u00a0  Thanks in advance.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549272"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 4, 2021 12:07 AM", "body": "Hi, Cathy. I am so sorry for the loss of your dad and for what you and your mother are going through. I lost my dad in January, and my family has been going through some similar issues with my mom. Like yours, she seemed to understand in the beginning and did OK at the funeral. Unlike your mom, she could not go back to where she and Dad were living because it was an independent living unit, and Mom could not live independently.\u00a0  She ultimately moved into Memory Care, and I\u2019m told that she does cry over our dad often in the evenings. The staff attributes it to sundowning, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a big part of it. But I also think that my dad was her anchor, and now she is unmoored. When we visit she usually asks about Dad. Sometimes it is a passing question like she just noticed he wasn\u2019t in the room. \u00a0In those instances, I usually tell her that he is at work or went out to get something, and she is usually satisfied. I have also learned to bring a bag of goodies and I will attempt to distract her with a treat of some kind at that moment. Other times it seems like she knows the answer already when she asks, so I do tell her the truth then - I don\u2019t want to cause more confusion. More than once, she has mentioned that Dad must have left her. That is a tough one, and I don\u2019t think I have done a very good job allaying those fears. I just try to reassure her that we\u2019ll see him soon. Again, some kind of distraction might help in that moment.\u00a0  I don\u2019t know if any of this helps you. A change of scenery might help, but as you already experienced, it will likely cause other reasons for distress.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147549272"},

It\u2019s hard to tell someone day after day that their husband is on a business trip because, at some point, \u00a0she realizes that he hasn\u2019t been home for months and that something is wrong but she doesn\u2019t know what. I like your idea about distractions\u2026  She woke up this morning in tears, sobbing, saying she doesn\u2019t have any family.\u00a0  \u00a0I am still leaning toward putting her in a facility for her own good because I think she would enjoy being with other people and not just watching me go through life. She feels worthless because she can\u2019t contribute. That said, when my dad was alive she didn\u2019t do much either in fact she did a lot less than she does now because he was not very mobile. So we are taking her places, we\u2019re going out to dinner we went to a Christmas tree lighting last night that she seem to enjoy, there is a lot of activity at the house and we have a golden retriever and a little kitten that she loves so actually a lot more going on than it used to be for her, you would think she would enjoy that but she knows at some level something is not right.\u00a0  She just now said that Christmas is coming and she needs to call her family to come get her\u2026 I probably shouldn\u2019t have said this but I told her that WE were her family and that was all that she has left. Then she asked he why no one told her that her mother and father and brother and sister had died.

{"date": "Monday, January 10, 2022 6:08 AM", "body": "I would add \"asking around\" to the advice about shelters and rescue organizations.  After dad died, we wanted a cat to keep mom company. I was looking for a more sedate cat who was well mannered rather than a trip hazard. My mom was 83 at the time, and TBH, I didn't want a pet that would survive her by many years (her last 2 cats made it to 20 and 21) that would presumably become my responsibility. My niece's friend was re-homing a 12 year old Maine Coon because she'd been transferred to Hawaii. This has worked out really well.\u00a0  Another option might be a Joy For All robotic pet. They're less work and a safer choice if the PWD is prone to over-feeding or harsh discipline. A friend got her mom one after I told her about them. Dad's MCF had them as a distraction and lovey for those who responded. The spares were in the office and when we'd meet with the DON my non-PWD mother found them irresistible. They borrowed it from the local library first- after her own cats started avoiding her mom because of her tendency to order them around. Her mom loved her new cat.\u00a0  HB", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147559436"},

My mother loves hers.\u00a0  Putting feelers out at the shelters is a good idea. Also at continuing care retirement campuses around you - it probably comes up a lot where a person in assisted living can no longer care for their dog and they need to find it a home, or someone dies or moves to a higher level of care and a dog is involved.  Also just spit balling here, but where I live there are some people who are kind of known as local dog gurus. They live dogs. They have pet sitting services, dog walking, training and obedience services etc. I wonder if you could hire someone like that to train a dog for you or take a puppy in for a month or two to get it ready for you. A small lapdog who is a mix of a couple breeds would likely be pretty easy to train and probably be ready to come home to you in not long. I would try asking around and emailing anyone who runs local small businesses related to dog services and see if someone would help you out with that initial training piece.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 23, 2021 6:04 AM", "body": "My mother, best friend, lives with my step father. Im 3 hours from her but would visit often or have her here with me and the kids for months at a time and she was always so much better and always happy. My siblings live by me but rarely bother to even visit. I've been paying her bills, fixing passwords and doing all the \"keep this between you and me cause people will think I'm crazy \" stuff since 2018. My step dad also always calls on me when he needs anything. She was last here 8 months ago for 6 weeks. She was wanting to go home and I offered to drive the whole distance since it was a day early and I guess this upset my step dad. He started messaging my older sister then I was told I'm a pain to deal with and why can't I stick to the plans. I finally got brave enough to ask why my mother couldn't come home if he's just sitting there and I'm doing all the driving. I guess that ruined it for me. I took her back at their arranged time and he didn't even hug her. He brushed past her open arms and left after she got in his car not saying a word to either of us. She was hurt. I told her not to worry everything was ok. I should have put her back in my car and kept her at that moment. She called me and I nearly fell over. She was on speaker phone and said she wanted me to leave her alone that I'm making trouble there and to stop calling. My kids and fiance were by me and their jaws dropped as tears rolled down my face as I pleaded, begged and apologized for whatever it was I did and said how much I love her. She said goodbye and hung up. Since then she has just deteriorated tremendously. She sneaks to call me and says she is sorry and hopes I understand that she has to live with him and if she upsets him he's horrible to her. And he is. He screams about her not being able to remember anything and reminds her she has alzheimer's which you are never to do. I finally recorded it and him threatening to move if she ever came to see me. I finally called the local protection agency after years of holding back and now she won't even talk to me because they did a welfare check and he told her it was me even though it's anonymous. My siblings went off on me and said I made things worse and I don't love my mother. Im the youngest and we are the closest. She requested I do her POA in 2019 and not tell anyone because she didn't want to hear about it and knew i would do what was right for her. I did what she asked but unfortunately I didn't know to have it notarized. Now he took her and had a POA in his name done. She didn't request it, she told me when she asked me that she just doesn't trust him. Well....my siblings are ok with her being treated this way and love that I am suffering. I wasn't allowed in the house since May, he pushed her out on the porch when I got there the one time he allowed me and the kids and I took her to lunch and she had to find her way into the house because we couldn't even use the bathroom. Drove back home. Now she won't even talk to me since the investigation. Im sick. My kids are missing school and devastated because she is a huge part of our family. She has never stayed with anyone but us. The social worker spoke to my siblings and suggested they, not me, make 2 visits per month to give her much older husband a break. I was not contacted again. They never side with me and if she lived with me they made it clear they would not have their lives interfered with that it's on me AND THAT'S FINE! She never wanted them to visit when they did make an hour available for her because she has to act like she's expected to by them like I do. They are judgmental but make poor choices from their pedestals but have lots of money so it's excusable. My mother and I stopped going to get together years ago because her and I sat in a corner entertaining each other and snuck out asap because it was no fun for us. I don't know what to do. He's poisoning what is left of her mind about me and when he decides he's had enough I'm the only one who sincerely wants my mother with me. They plan to put her in a home. I promised her I never would let that happen. Please, PLEASE give me any advice you can. Im desperate and shocked that the agency didn't even contact me or my mother's siblings who know this is a horrible change in character for her.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&page=-1&t=2147558893#ekbottomfooter"},

She has been living in her home with my father with 24 hour care--mostly a housekeeper who has CNA training, who has been with them for over 20 years. My father has been declining over the past few weeks and is now moving to hospice. We anticipate him dying within the next day or so.  We have been bringing my mother to visit by his bedside, and while present with him she understands what is happening. However, as soon as she leaves she forgets what has happened and where he is. She is asking on an hourly basis for an explanation. Right now my brothers are staying in the home and able to answer her, but I don't know what to do after they leave. Based on what I've experienced previously with her, I don't think the housekeeper explaining it will be sufficient and anticipate multiple frequent phone calls from her, with her upset, confused, and frustrated.\u00a0  Do you have any advise or best practices we could implement in this situation?

{"date": "Friday, December 3, 2021 1:41 PM", "body": "My 87 year old dad died of covid pneumonia 2 months ago. He was mom's caregiver. She has moderate to advanced Alz. We brought her to the hospital when he passed and she was at his funeral. She really didn't grasp what was happening there, she seemed to enjoy talking with people (acted like she knew them) then asked me why we were there. Initially, I brought her to my house to stay since she could not stay in their home alone. She was obsessed with wanting to call her family (specifically her mother and father and occasionally, my dad) to pick her up and take her \"home\" to \"New Jersey.\" We live in Texas. She seemed to regress to her high school years at that point. Because she was SO unhappy at my house and wanted to go \"home\" and cried every day, we decided to take her back to her house. As I suspected, she began to ask about my dad (and stopped asking about her mom and dad); wanting to know when he would be home. We had told her he was on a business trip, or a fishing trip, or traveling, or unable to get back because of covid restrictions, etc. She then became obsessed with looking at the window for him and leaving the lights on and checking the phone and telling me \"he TOLD me he was coming back tonight\". After a few days of that, she became very upset, crying, saying that he ABANDONED her, he left without even telling her, he doesn't have the decency to even call her; he's probably with another WOMAN, and that she's not putting up with being treated like this, and she's going to LEAVE.  She then begged me to tell her the TRUTH...she said she HAD to know. So, I told her he had not abandoned her, and was not with another woman, but that he was in heaven, and we watched a video of his funeral. She cried and seemed to understand, but then said \"the minister is talking about him as if he's DEAD!\" and continued to sit in the front window and watch for dad's car to pull in. Last night, I found her in the dark in the living room, looking out the window and sobbing. She had written a note to him (she has macular degeneration and cannot SEE, but I could make out most of the words she wrote, and it broke my heart.) She said that it's clear he does not want to be with her any more and that she is so hurt, she can barely breathe.  She went to sleep with the light on in the bedroom. When she woke up this morning, she asked me where he was and I said \"he's gone\" and she said \"is he DEAD gone, or just gone? I said \"dead gone\" and did not get a reaction. A few minutes later she commented how she can't believe he has not called just to say hi and ask how she's doing and she's SO HURT and not going to put up with being treated like this.\u00a0  It's such a TOUGH situation...no matter what is said, she spends her days being sad and miserable and fretting. I'm an only child, recently retired, and have spent all my energy for the past year taking care of them. I'm beginning to think she would be happier in a memory care facility with other people to interact with. Before we came back to her house, she talked about finding a boyfriend, getting her own place, getting a job, etc. Of course, she can't get her own place or a job or drive or anything of the kind. I just nodded and told her we would work something out. She is so sad and lonely...even though I'm with her 24/7, she's not happy.  NOTE: When she gets upset about dad, I tell her he's NOT with another woman, and he has no control over the situation and not intentionally trying to hurt her, but that does not ease her pain. Yesterday, she said we need to call the police and report him as a missing person.\u00a0  I need some words of wisdom, and lots of prayers for guidance to do the right thing.\u00a0  Thanks in advance.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&page=-1&t=2147549272#ekbottomfooter"},

I lost my dad in January, and my family has been going through some similar issues with my mom. Like yours, she seemed to understand in the beginning and did OK at the funeral. Unlike your mom, she could not go back to where she and Dad were living because it was an independent living unit, and Mom could not live independently.\u00a0  She ultimately moved into Memory Care, and I\u2019m told that she does cry over our dad often in the evenings. The staff attributes it to sundowning, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a big part of it. But I also think that my dad was her anchor, and now she is unmoored. When we visit she usually asks about Dad. Sometimes it is a passing question like she just noticed he wasn\u2019t in the room. \u00a0In those instances, I usually tell her that he is at work or went out to get something, and she is usually satisfied. I have also learned to bring a bag of goodies and I will attempt to distract her with a treat of some kind at that moment. Other times it seems like she knows the answer already when she asks, so I do tell her the truth then - I don\u2019t want to cause more confusion. More than once, she has mentioned that Dad must have left her. That is a tough one, and I don\u2019t think I have done a very good job allaying those fears. I just try to reassure her that we\u2019ll see him soon. Again, some kind of distraction might help in that moment.\u00a0  I don\u2019t know if any of this helps you.

She feels worthless because she can\u2019t contribute. That said, when my dad was alive she didn\u2019t do much either in fact she did a lot less than she does now because he was not very mobile. So we are taking her places, we\u2019re going out to dinner we went to a Christmas tree lighting last night that she seem to enjoy, there is a lot of activity at the house and we have a golden retriever and a little kitten that she loves so actually a lot more going on than it used to be for her, you would think she would enjoy that but she knows at some level something is not right.\u00a0  She just now said that Christmas is coming and she needs to call her family to come get her\u2026 I probably shouldn\u2019t have said this but I told her that WE were her family and that was all that she has left.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 23, 2021 6:04 AM", "body": "My mother, best friend, lives with my step father. Im 3 hours from her but would visit often or have her here with me and the kids for months at a time and she was always so much better and always happy. My siblings live by me but rarely bother to even visit. I've been paying her bills, fixing passwords and doing all the \"keep this between you and me cause people will think I'm crazy \" stuff since 2018. My step dad also always calls on me when he needs anything. She was last here 8 months ago for 6 weeks. She was wanting to go home and I offered to drive the whole distance since it was a day early and I guess this upset my step dad. He started messaging my older sister then I was told I'm a pain to deal with and why can't I stick to the plans. I finally got brave enough to ask why my mother couldn't come home if he's just sitting there and I'm doing all the driving. I guess that ruined it for me. I took her back at their arranged time and he didn't even hug her. He brushed past her open arms and left after she got in his car not saying a word to either of us. She was hurt. I told her not to worry everything was ok. I should have put her back in my car and kept her at that moment. She called me and I nearly fell over. She was on speaker phone and said she wanted me to leave her alone that I'm making trouble there and to stop calling. My kids and fiance were by me and their jaws dropped as tears rolled down my face as I pleaded, begged and apologized for whatever it was I did and said how much I love her. She said goodbye and hung up. Since then she has just deteriorated tremendously. She sneaks to call me and says she is sorry and hopes I understand that she has to live with him and if she upsets him he's horrible to her. And he is. He screams about her not being able to remember anything and reminds her she has alzheimer's which you are never to do. I finally recorded it and him threatening to move if she ever came to see me. I finally called the local protection agency after years of holding back and now she won't even talk to me because they did a welfare check and he told her it was me even though it's anonymous. My siblings went off on me and said I made things worse and I don't love my mother. Im the youngest and we are the closest. She requested I do her POA in 2019 and not tell anyone because she didn't want to hear about it and knew i would do what was right for her. I did what she asked but unfortunately I didn't know to have it notarized. Now he took her and had a POA in his name done. She didn't request it, she told me when she asked me that she just doesn't trust him. Well....my siblings are ok with her being treated this way and love that I am suffering. I wasn't allowed in the house since May, he pushed her out on the porch when I got there the one time he allowed me and the kids and I took her to lunch and she had to find her way into the house because we couldn't even use the bathroom. Drove back home. Now she won't even talk to me since the investigation. Im sick. My kids are missing school and devastated because she is a huge part of our family. She has never stayed with anyone but us. The social worker spoke to my siblings and suggested they, not me, make 2 visits per month to give her much older husband a break. I was not contacted again. They never side with me and if she lived with me they made it clear they would not have their lives interfered with that it's on me AND THAT'S FINE! She never wanted them to visit when they did make an hour available for her because she has to act like she's expected to by them like I do. They are judgmental but make poor choices from their pedestals but have lots of money so it's excusable. My mother and I stopped going to get together years ago because her and I sat in a corner entertaining each other and snuck out asap because it was no fun for us. I don't know what to do. He's poisoning what is left of her mind about me and when he decides he's had enough I'm the only one who sincerely wants my mother with me. They plan to put her in a home. I promised her I never would let that happen. Please, PLEASE give me any advice you can. Im desperate and shocked that the agency didn't even contact me or my mother's siblings who know this is a horrible change in character for her.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558893"},

Not for nothing do we call APS well check the nuclear option.\u00a0  It is possible that your SD is experiencing his own cognitive shift and has developed suspicion and paranoia around you personally. Does he have children looking out for him? Your mom's disease will progress and it's possible he will change his mind about you as incontinence sets in or sleep disruption impacts his ability to function. You may look very attractive as a care option once he prices out a facility. That said, she would probably be better cared for by a decent MCF than she is by him alone and unless he specifically barred you, you could visit.  A Certified Elder Law Attorney would have a better idea of steps you might be able to take to see your mom or to create a Plan B should SD die first. Legal stuff is best discussed with an expert.\u00a0  HB", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558893"},

Why would you protest him placing her?\u00a0 Don't you think that would be a better environment for her, rather than being verbally and emotionally abused in her own home?\u00a0 Get out of the box of \"I promised I'd never place her.\"\u00a0 If I were in your shoes, I'd much prefer she be cared for by professionals who won't abuse or threaten her.\u00a0 You should also be able to see her if she is placed, unless the placement is kept secret from you (and I have seen this happen to children, where the rest of the family won't say where the parent is or the parent is moved if the child visits them there).  Bad situation, no real way for you to win here, but the best option is them placing her.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558893"},

My SD has been ill with bowel incontinence since before they married and now has even more problems which require him to leave her alone fpr extended periods while in the bathroom or sleeping. He has told her to come live with me prior to him being upset with me. I have all the messages and conversations about her wanting me to be her POA while she was still able to think clearly. He pushed her to sign him as POA and im scared to even know what it states because she does and says whatever he wants just to keep things calm. Everyone in my family agreed she should be with me and the kids and how it would benefit her but now they're more worried about having to take part in her life if she is local to them. It's sad. The worst part is that time is so crucial. When everyone is done playing their power roles they will walk away and leave me to make things right and I will.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558893"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 23, 2021 8:10 AM", "body": "I would definitely hire an attorney who works in elder law. Even if there is nothing to be done at this moment, have a relationship with an attorney ready. It sounds like your step dad's physical or mental health may spin out of control and you may have to step in during a crisis and you will want firm legal footing and advice. The attorney would also know if there is any hope of undoing the POA or anything to be done via the courts. Does SD have his own kids or family members who might have POA for him? In either case you want legal advice from a good elder law attorney. In your shoes I might also research memory care facilities, both in her town and yours as a back up plan. In the event something happens and he is willing to send her to a facility, having done the research and being on the waitlist at some decent ones would help in that crisis. Maybe he will be willing to do that eventually as her dementia causes all kinds of inconveniences for him as she progresses. He might not want her to come live with you but a quality facility is not the enemy here, she would get much better care there and you'd be able to visit more and over see her care.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558893"},

Might have cognitive issues himself. \u00a0His kids will occasionally be around for a few weeks but his behavior chases them away just as it has for decades. I have medical POA for both of them, but only full POA on her. \u00a0They are in assisted living. I would love to have them in two separate facilities but they can\u2019t afford that. Plus my mom is co-dependent towards him and would be crying for him an hour after a move like that. \u00a0Their doctor advised me to walk back some for my own mental health. He reminded me they are in a safe place. \u00a0  My suggestion to you: \u00a0Walk back for your own mental health. \u00a0Your kids need you to be involved with their lives. \u00a0They need to see you up and about in your own life so that they will get up and attend school etc. Encourage all discussion of \u00a0your mom being placed in a facility. \u00a0It will be a much safer and more pleasant experience for her than living at home with your step-dad. \u00a0There will be people to talk to and have activities with. \u00a0She will receive care and be fed. She won\u2019t be screamed at by him. \u00a0Interaction between the two of them will be supervised by others. \u00a0  I would not pursue guardianship for either of them as long as he lives if I were you. \u00a0\u00a0  You cannot change everything and everyone else even though you can see that their situation is unacceptable. \u00a0This is one of those situations- except you can encourage placement so that she will at least be away from him.", "url": "https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147558893"},
