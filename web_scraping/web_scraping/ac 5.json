I don't tolerate a moment of stubbornness or instigating or gaslighting or guilt-tripping or passive/aggressive nonsense. I won't have any drama or 'performances' to get attention or to sabotage a special occasion. I do right by her but it's on my terms not hers.

The antipsychotic helped her a great deal. She also needed an antidepressant.

Reasonable would be great for me. I have a very difficult sibling too and had a very difficult mother that I was POA and executrix for. I had to let my sibs nasty comments roll off my back. Wondering why they were like this was a waste of time and energy for me. It is what it is. After mother died and the estate was settled I cut contact with my sib. It was the right move for me. I'm not saying any of this was easy. It wasn't but I learned to deal with it.   glad -happy for you that the job is going so well so far. I read your other posts about your AirBnB. Yikes!!! I think you have gone the right route reporting them. Hopefully some positive changes will be made. It must have been nice being home in your own bed for a little time.   sharyn - not nice that Nancy is very ill and also has an abusive sibling. Nancy has to put herself first and let others deal with her sister. That may mean having little contact. Nancy sounds like she was a lovely friend to your mother. I am sorry she is facing this. You say you are feeling low and down on yourself. Please give yourself a pat on the back for being a great help to your mother when she was going through dementia and also for being a great grandma to your grand-twins and a great mother to your children. Do something good for you -something that will pep you up. Hope senior kitty is still doing well.  I'm still working on treatments for the CFS. I definitely need more energy. MCT oil (bullet proof coffee) seems to help. It's early to say that this is reliable in an ongoing sense but every bit helps!!!  Since mother passing and cutting contact with sis my mind's peace has increased. It's over three years since mother passed and about 9 months since I cut contact with sis. There s no doubt that my quality of life has improved despite other difficult things that have arisen. My dd is recovering from her second chemo and doing well. The next one will see her half way through the chemo. She's not worried about the surgery at all which is good. After that comes the radiation.

Today on Facebook I received a message from a friend of my mothers. She want me to call her. Which I did.    it\u2019s so sad this woman was very helpful when my mom had gotten distrustful with my sister and me. She worked my mother. She helped with my mothers financial issues which my mom did not trust us.   she told me today that her sister has dementia she lives in Utah. This friend of my mothers live in California where I lived. A family member had her placed in a faculty which she escaped from and ended up in Wyoming.   this friend of my mothers (name is Nancy) Nancy is dying from cancer and can\u2019t go to Utah to help. This family member in Utah did get POA. How can they help her when she is difficult and combative?   I suggested they find a doctor or neurologist who specializes in dementia get her on an anti depressant even if it is capsule that they can open to put in her food or something like a juice. Find a facility that has a security system where they use a security bracelet on her sister so if she tries to leave the bracelet will set off alarms. My understanding is the family member trying to take care of Nancy\u2019s sister is older as well.   Nancy says she can\u2019t talk with her sister because she gets difficult accusing them of taking her money and home from her. I suggested redirecting her thoughts to things they know her sister enjoys\u2026.knitting gardening etc.   I also suggested if there is a family member who can gain her trust a granddaughter/grandson/niece etc that can help as well. If you all remember my mom did not trust my sister yet she trusted me and I could work with my mom to get her to be more cooperative.   if any of you have more suggestions to help Nancy I would appreciate it.

That\u2019s not my personal email though it\u2019s a company email.  I thought The whole point of this forum was how coming from dysfunctional families can add weight to caregiving. My only purpose of sharing something either from my own personal experience website or information I know of that was to share something supportive of caregivers.   Because of my knowledge and experience of the many issues and daily challenges of caregivers especially individuals working 24/7 without a support system my purpose is to help outside siblings to see that their daily challenges is everyone\u2019s problem and crisis in the family. This is especially true if the person is a sick parent with adult children.   We hear a lot about caregiving burnout and how this can take a physical and emotional toll on the caregivers health but unless you are the sibling working without support you may not be aware of what they go through.   I\u2019ve seen videos and information a wealth of information that shows if that Main Family Caregivers health breakdown then the family could have two sick people needing help the caregiver and the person needing care and the burden of responsibility could fall on another sibling unexpectedly.   I know of a personal experience where this happened in a family that did not communicate like they should with each other about their mothers health with dementia. One weekend out of no where that sibling decided to take Momma to visit another sibling for the weekend with the intention of leaving her. This is exactly what they did and overnight that siblings life and household changed.   This is why for families that can put aside any differences when a love one needs total care if they can have a plan of action in place and learn how to work together it can take some of the load off of just one individual and the burden of responsibility does not have to be placed abruptly on another sibling.   When a medical situation happens that forces a family member to need total care many families are at a lost of what to do. This only adds to an already dysfunctional family. How nice it is if people are aware that there may be other options task and responsibilities each member can take on. But is starts by members being willing to put aside their differences and look at the problem at hand as \u201cOur Family Crisis Our Family Emergency.\u201d", "date": "2022-03-26 00:52:10", "user_name": "LynnelT4shs", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm"},

I want to say I am so happy that you created this thread because this is a REAL PROBLEM for many. I have over 15 years as a Professional Caregiver known as a DSP and have seen this problem as well as so many others that families have to experience in their daily challenges of 24/7 caregiving.   I agree it is so hard for individuals especially the Main Family Caregiver to convince other siblings living outside of the home of what Never Ending Caregiving can do to the caregiver Physically and Emotionally!   It is for this reason I created an online program to help these individuals AND THEIR OUTSIDE SIBLINGS see that this crisis is EVERYONES crisis. I demonstrate the sad consequences and reality of what can happen if these individuals are not supported and give practical suggestions and a list of at least 10 task these outside siblings can do to be supportive even if they live in another state.    Please let me know your comments and I hope this is helpful.

The bite didn\u2019t require stitches so I went to my doctor on 8/29 to just get it checked out. That was the only visit and treatment I ever received for the dog bite. Since I had Medicare that was who the doctor's office charged for the visit. My daughter had a lawyer on retainer and suggested I file a claim. The lawyer was able to get a judgement for me and retained $235.00 for Medicare. The money sat in the account for several years. I called and asked had it been taken care of and was told after several calls that they would call me when things were settled. Fast forward I start receiving threatening letters from Medicare saying I owe them over $3000.00. With an attachment of over 20 pages of charges they said are related to the dog bite. The charges included knee surgery visits to a Dr. I see monthly and had been seeing since before the dog bite. I call my lawyer and leave a message that it\u2019s been way over 3 years since this happened and he needs to get his behind in gear and take care of this. His reply was a letter saying that he was no longer my attorney and that he took my suggestion as a threat and was going to call the sheriff on me. He still has the $235.00 in addition to the percentage he collected. Then Medicare comes for me telling me that I owe this $3000+ and they are going to be taking 15% of my social security check and charging interest as well. I called TOP Coast Professionals (who make the debt calls) and told them that there was ONLY 1 visit related to the bite. She told me I could send a copy of the billing for the bite and they could get the record adjusted. I got that called to say I was sending it she then said that I would also have to get letters from all the other 70+ service providers saying they hadn\u2019t treated me for the dog bite. I spoke with a gentleman named Ken at another number I called who agreed with me saying that my real financial liability was only $90.00. He was at NGHP. But that I would have to talk to Coast Professionals. He said I should get my money back but he couldn\u2019t say when that might be. I don\u2019t know the motivation of the person making out the report for me that day. They had the ICD codes they knew what was what. But here I sit having sold my jewelry just trying to pay my bills. I don\u2019t have much left to sell my wedding ring and engagement ring are gone. I have a few gold chains left. I\u2019m afraid to pawn my car. I couldn\u2019t pay it back and I\u2019d lose my car too. I don\u2019t know if you can help me but maybe the people who are reading this will be forewarned to just pay the bill don\u2019t wait for Medicare to call one day.

I've now figured out a great solution to the problem that allows their phones to be reset remotely either across town or across the country.I don't know if this will work on all phones but it does work on more than one version of Panasonic cordless phones. To test if it will work on your phone end a phone call without pressing OFF this will put the phone in the unreachable state. Then unplug the base station phone from power and after a few seconds plug it back in again. If this resets all the phone to working order then this solution will work for you.Knowing that the power reset fixes the problem I realized there was a good solution. The solution is to plug the base station power into a smart plug. The smart plug that I had available was one from tp-link while at my mother's house I used her wifi (yes your parent will need to have a wifi connection) to configure the smart plug. I set up a dedicated account that I log into using the Kasa app from my phone and from there it is very easy to turn the smart plug (and the phone plugged into it) off and then back on again. So now when I notice my mother's phone is unreachable I log into the app and and reset her phone while sitting on my sofa at home. The Kasa app login can also be used by my sisters if they notice the problem before me.The app could also be programmed to reset the phone every night when your mother is sleeping (if configured in this way the reset would happen regardless of the state of the phone) so that her phone will be available to callers in the morning.I don't know if anyone else has this problem but both my mother's have the problem so I think it's probably pretty common and the fix is so good that I wanted to share it.", "date": "2021-10-24 18:28:30", "user_name": "JorgeVerde", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Long-distance Caregiving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/wonderful-trick-to-remotely-reset-cordless-phone-of-parent-who-doesnt-press-off-button-470787.htm"},

{"post_id": "472781", "title": "Just want to tell my story to help others.", "body": "Last year in December my husband and I moved my parents to live with us. We had prayed for years as we had seen them declining and falling apart both in health and ability to care for one another that we would be able to serve them this way. I must confess how naive we were. We love them dearly but the last year consisted of 5 hospitalizations 2 stints in rehab and too numerous to count doctors visits (with tests as all the Dr's were new and wanted to do their own testing) and that was just my father....we also have my mom with us who has parkinsons along with other illnesses. Dad was WC bound for the most part but he always believed he was fine and could walk again soon. 10 months of mult days a week PT did not change anything and he still declined.My husband and I quickly saw signs of dementia in both of them. Dad was tested and early stage Alz confirmed. Mom will be tested soon.Both gave up drivers licenses when they came.In Aug dad was diagnosed with biliary duct cancer and b/c of comorbities was not a candidate for any treatment. I was encouraged to bring in hospice early for the support and he did have a VA provided care giver 3 hrs in the morning. He passed away on Christmas day this year at home with the family around him.We now are in a new season of walking my mom through grieving the loss of her husband of 60 years with no real support system near by except my husband and I.I was an ICU nurse for over 20 years and can honestly say this was the hardest year of my life. So much we didn't know going in. I would not have necessarily changed them living with us but maybe we would have moved to where they were? It's so much harder for them to create new support networks than for us.I definitely should have picked a gerontologist instead of trying to mimic what they had in TX. By the time my dad passed he had 12 doctors! I never thought through how different our dietary preferences would be and become such an issue or prepare for setting boundaries. Obviously had not spent enough time with them to know where they were each were truly at.I never considered how difficult creating a social and support system would be for them (or the effects on my own as most of my time was at home) I had planned on returning to work in January after they came in December. NAIVE!! I actually returned to work part time in May.My husband and I consistently have to work to stay on the same team and make time for one another. This challenges us as we do not have children and had nothing but time together prior. These are not complaints but observations.

No family should ever have to make it their life's work to stay on top of everything in the care facility or hospital their loved one is in every moment of the day. Sadly we do have to because that's pretty much the healthcare system for the elderly and family has to do the advocating on behalf of their own. There has never been a nurse social worker or other healthcare professional who has ever gotten away with rolling an eye placating or making a snotty retort to me. When dealing with these people you can't get mad and lose your temper. I never do. I will have straight answers though. Or I will get the bit between my teeth and not let it go until someone loses a job. It's a shame what people have to do just to make sure their elderly are being decently cared for.

I couldn't tell you how many countless elders I've said this to. That they're not a burden because they need help around the house or with personal care or running errands like shopping or a doctor's appointment.  The \"burden\" is the narcissism. It's the assuming that the family will simply be \"voluntold\" that they are the old-age care plan. It's the expectation that family will simply accept their new life in nanny-slavery with joy in their hearts and smiles on their faces. It's the instigating and trouble making for sport. It's the endless complaining. It's the stubbornness that often crosses over to dangerous absurdity. It's the orneriness over nothing and the \"performances\" (such things as a totally unnecessary trip to the ER because to make sure you miss out on something you've been looking forward to). It's the sense of entitlement like the whole world owes them simply because they were lucky enough to not die young and were able to become elderly. It's the cheapness (even when they have money) and unwillingness to pay the actual price for what things cost. It's overdoing the neediness unnecessarily. Everyone here knows what I mean. So many seniors like children will behave as if they are incapable of the slightest independence and can't do anything for themselves. Not because they actually are but because they want to be catered to and waited upon by acting like helpless infants. Then they resent it when people treat them like helpless infants. When this behavior doesn't achieve the desired outcome they evolve to being a \"senior brat\" and a whole new kind of attention-seeking tantrums start up.  This is what makes our dear elderly loved ones a \"burden\".", "date": "2021-12-13 08:52:41", "user_name": "BurntCaregiver", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/lo-organized-crime-came-on-thursday-night-and-it-had-an-exquisite-sequence-471677.htm"},

Why shouldn\u2019t people have the right to end of life when all we\u2019ll be is a burden?", "body": "That isn't how it works in Switzerland. People are not let go because their care is costly and unpleasant and family doesn't get a vote in when it is time for the person \"to go\". Only the patient can decide when it is time and the patient must first go through psychological testing to be certain that the person understands what he is asking and that this is what the person wants. Dignitas which is the one often used (about 10000.00 for the entire process) demands that you have thorough paperwork and interviewing that this is your wish. The one difference between there and here is that you don't need the \"6 months and you will be dead\" rule nor do you need to have a diagnosis of a life-taking disease. You can merely be OLD and request this. Or you can be facing down a diagnosis of dementia and ask for this. But you cannot HAVE dementia to the extent you are no longer mentally competent.  I agree with you that I wish we had a \"Dignitas\" here. As an old retired RN I very MUCH wish it were here. You should not be paying for your elder's care. What will happen when that money you are spending is not there for your own age? Who will pay? Just listening to how many veterinarians take their own lives on an NPR program the other day; animal care is so difficult and so heartbreaking. But the thing they feel most enables them is the readily available medications to do it. One in six vets they say will eventually relieve themselves of their own lives with their own medications.

{"post_id": "471716", "title": "How could I SAY that?", "body": "So this isn't so much a question as it is something I need to get off my mind or I'll go crazy. My mom (65) has had two strokes this year and at least in my opinion although it hasn't been diagnosed yet is suffering from dementia of some kind. I have lived with her since 2005 and although we had a great relationship we are both hot-tempered and have had our share of fights. After mom had her second stroke and it was clear that she would need full-time care I turned down a well-paying new job and have since devoted myself to caring for her alone. This has been since October 18th of this year and I am ashamed to say it but I have already had like four or five meltdowns. And I'm talking screaming crying hysterical meltdowns to the point where I've wanted to kill myself where I've wanted her to die where I've said incredibly terrible things and punched walls and actually threw and broke a portable grill on my kitchen floor. I have accidentally put bruises on my mom's wrists because I was trying to stop her from kicking me (again) and felt so guilty about it that I contemplated contacting my aunt to come take care of her because I thought I was unfit. I have said things to my own mother like \"I hope the next stroke kills you!\" \"I wish you were dead!\" \"I regret brining you home from the hospital!\" \"I hate you!\" and so on. I have felt instantly guilty when these horrible words burst out of me I have apologized and my one saving grace is that my mom doesn't remember any of this but I do and it breaks my heart and will be a stain on my soul that no amount of time or forgiveness will ever get rid of.  So in my dark hours lying awake in bed at night after another long and miserable day of trying to take care of this woman who I love more than anyone else and who I would do anything for I ask myself one question over and over...How could I SAY that? How could I say these things that no human being should ever say to another? How could I say these things to my mother who is the most amazing person I've ever known who raised me and loved me and made my childhood happy and safe? How could I get so angry at this person who is clearly sick and can't help it? How can I even think these things about my mother who deserves so much better than this than me? I have tortured myself with these questions and so many more. I have felt guilt so raw and intense that it cripples me and keeps me from getting out of my chair and makes it so I can't sleep. I thought I would die from the weight of the shame I felt. But then I started to answer my own questions and I'll tell you how I can say these things that are horrible and that I don't mean. They come from fear from exhaustion from sadness and desperation and resentment and feeling trapped. These words come from anger and guilt and stress and not knowing how long this situation is going to last or how bad it will get. These words come from having to give up my job my life and some of my sanity to take care of a woman who can be childish mean-spirited combative and aggressive. These words come from being sick of changing diapers and cleaning sheets and being kicked and grabbed and having to fight her for every inch of everything. These words come from the exhaustion of just trying to get her up and clean and dressed for a doctors appointment and knowing that it is going to be a struggle the entire way because she is completely unmotivated to do anything. These words and feelings come from knowing that when I try to give her her meds she'll most likely slap them out of my hand again. These words come from her lack of hygiene and having to deal with her horrible breath and dirty hair and having to wash her in the shower. These words come from having to clean down the entire bathroom at least twice every day and trying not to gag on how disgusting it all is. These words come from grief and the loss of our lives being happy and free.

She can live another 2 or 3 decades and where does that leave YOU? You need to think about the next step here; how to get mom on Medicare and then apply for Medicaid to get her placed because you can't and shouldn't go on like this; it's not healthy for either one of you. Keeping mom home has to work for BOTH of you and clearly it's not so something has to change. Having meltdowns doesn't mean you're a bad person; just that you're an exhausted and burned out person and rightly so!   I grew up with a mother who agreed to take her mother into our house and they did not get along. My mother was extremely resentful of having my grandmother living with us and it wreaked havoc in the house all the time. Nobody was happy. Mom should have made other arrangements for grandma so that BOTH of them could have had a better life meaning ALL of us would have had better lives; dad and myself included. Instead she felt like she 'had' to keep grandma in our house out of some misguided sense of duty when grandma would have been better off in a nursing home! Ultimately mom cried uncle and sent grandma off to an aunt's home to live and the aunt said No Way and sent her to a nursing home where she did fine. She lived to be 91 and died in her sleep one night peacefully with a smile on her face. It should have been done YEARS earlier.  Please take your life back and allow yourself to HAVE a life now. You deserve to. If I had to live with and care for my mother I'd have shot myself honestly. I could NEVER do it in a million years! She lives in Assisted Living since 2014 and in Memory Care since 2019 thank God. She's doing fine and I have enough on my plate managing her entire life finances doctors etc! I care for her but no hands on care which makes a big difference. We can maintain a fairly decent relationship that way otherwise we'd be at each other's throat 24/7!!

If you don't YOU are going to have some serious health issues.   Deep breaths. OK? Start the process of finding her a place that suits her best. Look at that as the 'long term' goal and each day of survival as a 'short term' goal.   Why our LO's lash out at US and treat total strangers with an over abundance of love and affection will FOREVER be a question I'll be asking.   Please put yourself first.   In fact take mom to the ER for that UTI and refuse to bring her home. The SW at the hospital can help you find placement for mom.

I see you say Mom has not signed up for SS or Medicare if she hasn't you need to find a way to get it done. Both can be done online I think. If Mom has any money use it. My Mom had 20k. I applied for Medicaid in April placed her May1st and she privately paid May and June. June I confirmed with the caseworker that Mom was spent down her money and I supplied all info needed. July 1st Medicaid started paying.  You don't need to physically care for Mom. All you need to do is make sure she is safe and cared for. My Mom was in my home then an AL and finally in LTC.

There's a need for support on a site like this b/c caregivers to elders in general are burned out exhausted and devastated b/c they've devoted their lives to loved ones who basically do not appreciate their effort; who complain &amp; treat them like dirt in return. So we're here to vent; to ask for help ideas tips support and to hear that we're not alone when we feel like we're falling off the edge of the Earth. You're not hearing positive stories b/c there are very FEW positive stories to share. Aside from yours that is.  You on the other hand are in an atypical situation where you're thrilled to be caring for your mom for the past 14 years thrilled to have given up your former life to do so thrilled to be 'relaxing' and to have quit your job given up your freedoms friends girlfriends concerts and all the rest of it in exchange for your caregiving duties. Which is great for YOU and you should be applauded for your devotion to your mother who apparently loves &amp; appreciates all of your efforts.  But that scenario is suited to probably 3% of the planet if that in reality. So to come here to this forum and expect to hear YOUR stories uplifting and 'non-depressing' stories such as the one you're telling is about as likely as a snowstorm in Florida in August truthfully. You don't like people telling you how YOUR story is off-the-wall yet you're here telling us OUR stories are off the wall or depressing? This is OUR reality James and for us it's an UGLY reality whether you agree with it or not. Because caregiving to elders IS a hard &amp; ugly job as you may find out yourself if your mother becomes incontinent &amp; dementia ridden &amp; starts playing with her feces &amp; spreading it all over the walls the bed &amp; the furniture. Then you may decide to come back to AC &amp; seek some of the support you once found to be 'so depressing' huh?  The vast majority of us are not 'relaxing' or 'enjoying' our time watching TV or fiddling around on a computer. I can tell you I DO have a cell phone which rang continuously with calls from my parent's ALF with them telling me of mom's falls all 95 of them. With calls from their doctors and nurses and hospice and EMTs and ambulance companies and specialists and hospitals and rehabs and mortuaries and moving companies for the SEVEN MOVES I've made for them and and AND. Because for most of us that's part of Real Life which you have managed to bow out of for the most part aside from staying home and relaxing and answering calls from your mother which you 'don't mind doing at all'. Which is your prerogative certainly.  But please reserve YOUR judgment for US like you've been telling US to do for YOU.  I don't like Twitter; I find it depressing and rather offensive.

It was SO INTERESTING to be on 'that side' of packing. What did I truly need? What did I truly NOT need anymore.It was very stressful but also calming to see stuff go out the door to the Goodwill and feel the weight of years of junk leaving.I know I need to be more kind to my own mother when she allows me to clean for her. Some of the things I was encouraged to toss were things that I thought I needed and this a.m. I cannot think of a single thing that might be 'missing'.A wake up call and interesting to be on this side of the packing/cleaning/moving end. I was stalled with being burnt out as I promised DH he would not have to pack a single box except for his own clothes. And that's all he's done.Hoping for a 'smooth move' on Saturday! I am ready to hand the keys to the new owners and take a vacation.

{"post_id": "473547", "title": "Tables Turned: Packing, Cleaning and Moving", "body": "It has definitely been a learning curve. I tried really I tried to get as much culled out before the 'big pack' as I call it but so much stuff really is necessary for a few more years. I'm still baking and so all those supplies need to stay. I still can a few things and all that stuff also. However the thought of canning salsa ever again--meh I think I can do without.   I watched my girls do exactly what I have done to mother umpteen times and felt that I almost owe her an apology--although in her case she hoards papers and magazines and envelopes--true garbage and I have too many 'craft interests' which do benefit people. But I may never do them again.   This move has not been without a lot of drama and a few tears. DH is capable of doing a LOT of home improvement but while he needed to do some smaller jobs he got slammed by work and instead of helping me he was working at his job. So we're way behind on the 'schedule'....  LUCKILY--we sold this house to our nephew and then rented it back from him so technically we don't have to hand over the keys until the 31st. We plan to have everything out by Wednesday.  Our carpet guy mis measured and so we have no carpet in the 2nd most important area--the office. Praying that we can get that done by Tuesday--as DH HAS to work. Probably the entire office will be in the garage and we'll move it in and set it up next week.   None of our appliances can go in until the cabinetry is done and THEY are waiting on the main contractor to tear out a portion of the kitchen island so that also means our granite countertops are still sitting in the warehouse.   I'll do the best I can but b/c of the new sheetrock I can't 'put away' my kitchen as I would have to re-dust every drawer and shelf yet again.   We don't have much furniture really planning to downsize but SIL had some furniture he uses for staging small condos and he gave that to us. So we have like one truckload of furniture and a lot of boxes to move. My middle daughter is coming over after school and she will super organize the boxes so the move can be effective and smooth.   Through all of this I have been very aware of the unrest in the Ukraine and it has certainly put perspective on my little first world problems. We're so incredibly blessed with this new place and I know it's where we belong now and for the rest of our lives. This too shall pass and the memories of the home with our babies will be a joy I hope. I have to say a day didn't go by that I didn't feel like we were 'asses to elbows' in this tiny home. Funny how now we routinely get 'lost' in the new place.   Life is funny--my OD just committed to a 1500 sf addition to her lovely home and my YD just bought a freaking mansion of 7000 sf. So we're all in flux this summer.  I pray my back and hip hold out..I was in so much pain yesterday it was unbearable. Tomorrow will be all directing and bossing people. I don't plan to lift anything over 10 lbs.   Thanks for just listening. This is one of life's most stressful occurrences and I for one am really really feeling it!! I broke out in shingles for the 3rd time in 15 months. Due to stress.

It's SO hard for me to acknowledge that something is truly not useful to me (or useful at all). And learning that sentimental value is not the same as monetary value was also a bitter pill. Stories like yours encourage me. Plus having cleaned out at least two houses for elders going to facilities I recall going through the belongings of others and making the decision on what was essential and what was not - and it wasn't even my stuff! Sometimes I picture if I were suddenly gone and someone ELSE were cleaning out my house to sell it.... they would not realize/discern what items ever mattered to me and what items did not. I think it would all end up in a dumpster. Being able to continuously organize and try to keep it pared down seems much better than having the decision made by someone else after I'm no longer able to.

Sounds difficult to live with but unless your hub sees there is a problem he s not likely to change. His self-centered parents trained him well. Have you sought counselling to help you deal with this and maybe set some boundaries? It must be very stressful for you.  ali - while living in a dysfun fam we learn many dysfun ways. Identifying the problem is the first and a big step. I am still a work in progress.  On the dd front good news. The chemo is working even after only one session. The lump is already smaller. She has her second session next week with some small alterations in dose to reduce the D and better meds so we are hopeful that she will not repeat what happened before.   I had a meltdown today - just too much going on. DD asked me to drive her next week to two appointments one at 9:30 and the other at 11 the next day. As much as I want to do everything I can to help her I have my limitations -particularly my age the CFS/FM and the fact that I am moving house in a few months and am downsizing and preparing to sell. Also the fact that since her diagnosis I have less support than usual and am being asked to give more than usual doesn't help either. I wish I could do whatever she needs me to I wish I could take this all away I wish I felt better and able to do more but I can't and I don't. I am coming out of a relapse and mornings are not my thing anyway. I called her and she understands and says whatever she asks is always framed with what I feel I can do and \"No I can't\" is fine but my mother's heart wants to do it and feels bad when I can't. On top of that were several smaller things which added to my frustration - once more the bank has something wrong a laptop died Google is misbehaving the plumber didn't come when he said he would and so on.

Recovery from caregiving is still important in my daily life. I tend to isolate a lot and Covid really helped do that very effectively. I do appreciate all the support I found here when I really needed it!  Nasty letters? Not from mom but nasty letters sent from each twisted sister to others. That is the passive aggressive ways of my origin family.  TS1 sent a packet yes a packet on bullying to several family members including to my mom's husband. I was caring for him and mom for four years he had general decline but still very sharp. Mom lost in the depths of dementia. TS1 was angry because I was there helping them and thought it was a result of my bullying them that I was there. Twisteds really preferred their denial at that point and thought there were no dementia problems there and TS1 never visited or assisted. She lives about 5 miles away. She was afraid of me verbally assaulting her the therapist!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  TS2 sent letters to professionals that my mom had hired over the years. The list included the CPA attorneys doctors etc. She was wanting to verify the extent of the dementia whether mom needed care what was appropriate care and the value of home care all the while telling these people what mistakes as she judged I had made in my life including my first marriage 35 years earlier even some things that went back to high school. I found out about the TS2 letter because mom's husband showed it to me. He was hurt and astounded by the accusations made against me. He and I were very close.  The TS2 letter sent to the pros was given to me by mom's husband again after it was given to him by their CPA. Again the hurt for him. I scanned and sent that to TS2 and she was angry that someone had given it to me. Of course I did not tell her where it came from.  Just a sampling of the craziness of my two twisted sisters. I haven't talked with TS1 the therapist in about five years now.  I should have posted this to the dysfunctional family thread.

{"post_id": "473712", "title": "Just wanted to share...", "body": "My entire belief in and approach to determining whether or not a study was worth reliance changed after taking statistics classes. There are so many variables that aren't distinguished in studies and sometimes in my mind make them worthless.  I skimmed the cited article and with absolutely no offense to WearyNow I didn't think it was particularly unique or frightening enough for me to consider napping when I feel like it. On the contrary I think napping is the body's method of resting when it's needed or especially after working hard or outside. I used to feel the need for a nap after mowing the lawn or gardening!  First there apparently were absolutely no other dementia contributors factored in. From articles I've read sugar consumption if more than \"average\" (whatever that is) could be a factor. It's well known that sugar and excess sugar consumption is not helpful to health for various reasons.  Second the sample tested is small. How many people between 74 and 88 exist? What percentage is 1400 of that total number of people in that age group? 1% 5% 10% more???? Who knows?  \"The new study used data gathered over 14 years by the Rush Memory and Aging Project which followed over 1400 people between the ages of 74 and 88 (with an average age of 81).\"  Third apparently no other health factors were considered in the study. What was each person's health status before during and after the study? Did the people exercise on a regular basis? Interact with others? Eat a Mediterranean diet or an American diet?   Live in a large populated area or a remote area? Live in a country which supports family interaction through generations or one more like America in which generations sometimes separate and move through different lifestyles?  Fourth what support did they have - family friends? Were they interacting with others whether still working part time jobs volunteer jobs (that to me would be an important issue).   Fifth the study duration is small very small: 14 out of 365 days annually.   \"The new study used data gathered over 14 years by the Rush Memory and Aging Project which followed over 1400 people between the ages of 74 and 88 (with an average age of 81).  \"For 14 days each year participants in the current study wore a tracker that captured data on their movements; No movement for an extended period between the hours of 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. was interpreted as a nap.\"  What season was this? People get more tired during especially extreme weather. And weather has changed over the last several years. Summers are hotter people have less energy and that can also occur when it's frigid outside and some people cuddle up in warm blankets instead of moving around a lot.

All of the companies are screened. They have had a lot of success at both ends. It was on the \"Today\" Show.  It's sounds like you and hubby jumped in and did a remarkable job reversing everything. You should both be commended.  You are doing an absolutely fabulous job! Keep in mind years' ago someone once said to me \"You can let people rock your boat but don't let them tip you over in it\". I think you get my message.  You are trying to give I assume (your mother-in-law) dignity and quality of life. You also sound like you have \"order\" in your life. When you are caregiving you have to keep some people at bay. I am organized just like you neat on time people remarked how orderly and \"peaceful\" everything is. Peaceful I repeat. This doesn't happen on it's own. It's by keeping a routine schedule and being a good steward over what you do have (materials things living arrangement etc.)  Don't let other people's \"erratic\" behavior come into your castle. It's takes work it takes declining \"some not all\" invitations and you set the schedule for visitations with your mother-in-law. When they visit \"the troublemakers\" you give them a window for example Mom is at her best in the morning from 10AM-12 Noon. Tell them we have appointment to get to that gets them out the door.  I don't imagine this sibling ever shows up with a box of pastry or flowers and asks you \"do you need anything\"? You have to take control which you certainly have and limit contact with the sibling who will destroy everything you built.  I am the female version of Felix Unger so I have my quirky ways we all do. But I insist on keeping my small place with Mom a place of beauty. And some people seek out to destroy that. Don't be polite about this.    The one's that make the most noise usually do the least and usually get the most attention and resources in the family. Unfortunately oftentimes their situation never improves. We all have a relative or (2) who needs a little help now and then along the way and you pitch in and they get on their feet--a death divorce sickness job loss--life happens. But for other's it can be lifelong with no end or improvement of any kind in sight. I call it the kitten who lost their mittens. They always have a problem. Probably more than what you can provide. More like they need professional help-social worker retraining skills perhaps housing and food voucher. They need to be assessed but you can't do everything.   Stay centered.

My mother-in-law is 77.  For 8 years since my father-in-law passed my husband's sibling and adult children have taken advantage of her; stripped her financially destroyed her property stole whatever they could to support their addictions. They left their dogs for her to care for (11?) and the list goes on. Anyway the house was full of rodents roaches a large rat snake (not a pet) holes in the walls and floors falling through.   Mom did not want to leave her husband died here so my husband left his job moved to his mom's removed all the human rats and spent 2 years cleaning the property and getting ready for a new home be put on it for her.   My husband found homes for multiple dogs so now we are down to 4 outside and 2 inside) and the new home was put on the property. Now we are getting ready to remove the remaining debris.  However Mom's personal care got to be too much for hubby alone so I retired from my position - he picked up a local job and now I care for mom 24/7.   When I was working I bought mom all new clothes bedding towels drapes furniture appliances etc...so everything was ready for the new house.   To present....So far it has been pretty easy...I clean and do laundry in the AM. She gets up around noon then the rest of the day belongs to her. Typically every other day begins with giving her a shower doing her hair cleaning her bed and bath rooms cooking breakfast massaging her knees and feet and cleaning up incontinence issues as they occur throughout the day - which occassionally means multiple showers.  Her bedroom is cleaned regularly and her 2 little inside dogs (one is mostly house trained the other one poops and pees wherever she feels like it probably because she is a senior dog) - are cared for; fed and bathed.  Mom has since progressed wonderfully in many ways - health wise. Her skin and face looks fresh the arthritic swelling in her knees (which made wearing pants difficult for her) has significantly gone down and she is now able to move around her new home much easier.   Problem 1: One sibling. Everything is drama and most of the time this sibling needs money. - which mom always tries to give. Last year the child demanded a lot of money for a downpayment on a car...literally bullied her until it was received -- and it is like this most every month. Its always something leaving Mom upset and wanting to give whatever money is \"needed\" to this child.   When we explain there is no money to give the bullying gets worse mom gets stressed and anxious her memory lapses she gets confused angry and frustrated. She talks about selling everything going to a nursing home or just dying. It literally takes a couple of days to calm her down.   This sibling hasn't been over for 2 weeks now..mom is starting to flourish though she still calls this sibling everyday.   Problem 2. I will have start working again soon. I am applying for work-from-home positions. Though finding something legit is proving difficult.  So coping: I think I am doing okay.  I do feel a little isolated at times not too bad..Financially we are stressed.

I've been working part-time off and on for years family has always been a priority so caregiving fell on my shoulders. Just seemed to make sense to move Dad into our house so he wouldn't be alone and I could still take care of the pets and everything else. We rented a van and moved our college aged daughter into my old bedroom at his house (she's away at school) and my father took her room at our house. My sister moved some of her things into his house in her old room and kept some of her things in her apartment upstairs (my father was very worried that someone would break into his house and didn't want it sitting empty - we figured one less thing for him to worry about). Basically everyone's life was uprooted. The first couple of weeks my father was literally awake all the time. The rehab facility changed his medication and added some new drugs that really did not agree with him. His doctor prescribed additional medication to help him sleep - it woke him up and made him more confused. It took a while to get his medications straightened out but we did. Showering was an issue - thankfully my husband volunteered for the job. Incontinence is an issue. He still gets the urge to use the bathroom but can't make it. So he wears adult diapers. Only problem is that he still thinks he has to run to the bathroom. So he was doing this at night and not putting the diaper back on properly or just not putting it back on at all. So there were many many night time accidents. And like a child he woke us up nightly screaming he was wet (him the bed everything needed to be changed all hours of the night). So I was constantly washing something - my dryer called it quits after two weeks (I completely understood - it was a lot of work).   He has physical and occupational therapy a few times a week at home along with a visiting nurse. The therapy helps a lot but feels like my home has a revolving door - always someone stopping by for something. My dogs are always barking at someone. The therapy has helped him immensely. My father is walking much better with a cane and has learned how to properly use the bathroom and potty chair in his room. The occupational therapist worked with him and he no longer wets the bed at night the way he was when he first moved in. Biggest problem right now is his constant craving for attention and severe memory loss. If he wakes up at 3 in the morning he thinks we're all ignoring him (we're sleeping). I keep reminding myself that it's all new for all of us him included. It's not easy and I don't know what the future holds.Some days are good and some days are tough. Some days walking around the Walmart can feel like a vacation.", "date": "2022-02-02 21:54:42", "user_name": "HoLLkh7161", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/how-are-you-coping-187022.htm"},

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "Not sure if this thread is still monitored but in answer to the question one day at a time. My parents moved in with me back in 2019; my dad had Parkinson's &amp; mom was worn out from caregiving for him. He was a piece of work; used to being independent and being the boss but with the PD the filter that used to keep him at least nominally interested in other people disappeared. He passed away after a hospitalization in 2020 - probably a PE but a blessing/release in any case.   So now it's just mom living with me. I bought a house for them to move in with me because my condo would not have worked (stairs). Overextended myself on it but it's done. All of their stuff is in the main part of the house; I have my own room/bathroom but just about everything else is hers. My stuff is in the basement as is the rest of hers because when we moved God forbid we got rid of too much. Dishes pots/pans etc. that never get used but have to be unpacked &amp; put on shelves... (\uff0d\u2038\u10da).   I ended up spreading my own furniture out to occupy the space I needed to avoid having her ideas take over the basement too. My dad didn't leave her with much financially and what she had left after their house sold is almost gone because she just buys things we don't need. Retail therapy.   She's had a cough for 4 months now - her dr is treating the symptoms which is about all he can do since the likely reason for it is she eats too much of the wrong things (wheat dairy etc.). I think she has an eating disorder - she used to be quite heavy but had gastric bypass followed by several other complications. She has plenty of energy to shop or cook all over the kitchen but gets exhausted if she has to do anything she doesn't want to do.   I get that some of this is probably backlash from being my dad's caregiver herself for so many years; he wasn't a kind man before PD &amp; she's a retired nurse so there was a lot she did that probably most wouldn't have done. But sure as she feels the least bit neglected she gets \"sick\" which then becomes an actual sickness requiring attention &amp; reassurance.   I have no friends that aren't also now her friends because she's competitive about it - had to go meet my co-workers so now I don't even have that. We go to church when she's up to it - which she hasn't been for weeks because she's self-conscious about the coughing. Yes she has asthma but again cutting out the wheat and dairy help that too - can't cut that out though because that's what she eats: sandwiches with meat and cheese...   I've been working from home for the last almost 2 weeks because we caught whatever bug is floating around; she got dehydrated and dizzy/unsteady. She's better today (drinking more water) &amp; I'm looking forward to going back to the office but then what? She sits at home &amp; waits for me to come home instead of making new friends or contacting the ones she has. I'm not her husband - I'm her daughter....   She won't take care of herself because she knows that I will - sister moved out of the country to not have to deal with this. 2 brothers live in different states - bless them they both have had her stay with them for a week here &amp; there but now mom is not comfortable flying by herself &amp; wants me to go with her. Doesn't get that part of these trips is giving me a break &amp; God forbid anyone should actually say that - she'd go into a funk &amp; throw it up in my face for the rest of her life. NH is not an option at all. Couldn't do it.   She has no hobbies &amp; doesn't want any friends that aren't associated with the church. More &amp; more dependent &amp; enmeshed as the days go by &amp; I'm the bad rotten terrible person who can't say anything because other people do not get it. I love my mom - I really do! - and I was so glad that they moved here instead of being 750 miles away but she's overly dependent &amp; needy &amp; it's getting harder to handle. So one day at a time. I can do this for today.

Maybe AgingCare can post an article on how to navigate the complexities around it.", "body": "The people who generally face difficulty getting care help or placing their loved ones in a facility are those who pretty much are living month to month on their SS checks or maybe with a small pension on top of it. They may be renters or have little equity in their home. They can't afford to pay in home caregivers Medicare doesn't provide much help. Community Medicaid provided caregivers may be a possibility but in reality it is very difficult to get. The Dr's and nurses really don't provide any guidance or help. The Dr may tell you (the patient's family member) to call nursing homes but when you call them the answer is always \"no openings\" or get on a waitlist. It doesn't help if there isn't the money to private pay first and then go on Medicaid. Those with assets have an easier time of getting admission as they may be able to private pay first. So how do these people who need NH home care or will very soon but don't have a lot of money get the care they need? The answer a lot of the time is to send them to the hospital as a \"social admit\". This is sometimes easier said than done though and many in the industry don't think it should be done. But in reality in many cases there is no other alternative other than maybe calling a state social worker (or APS). I stumbled across a nursing forum for RN's once and there was this whole long thread of hospital nurses berating family members who brought their demented loved one to the hospital. They didn't think it was right that otherwise healthy people that didn't need acute care were dropped off to them because family couldn't deal with them. The fact is though it is incredibly difficult for family to place someone with little assets other than their SS check directly to a NH if not impossible and there are no other options available.", "date": "2022-03-23 16:37:58", "user_name": "mstrbill", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/what-can-be-done-about-difficult-placement-situations-maybe-agingcare-can-post-an-article-on-how-to--473769.htm"},

With that said remember you owe no one hear and explanation but with 14 years under your belt as a caregiver especially one doing it while at home you do have a wealth of knowledge based around experience that would be helpful to many.

Even still as one poster mentioned in your thread I do hope you keep posting and share your positive experiences when it comes to cargiving. We often hear about how caregiver destroyed families and lives very rarely do we hear about how it has enriched and promoted happiness.   Please share your story vent or just look around.

In life people who are content and happy and functional tend to not need the support that this site gives to so many of us who struggle with CG and who need the support to get through problems and come out the other end with peace and calm.   It sounds like you already ARE peaceful and calm and that's wonderful for you.   For those of us who have to deal with toxic family abuse situations money issues--this site has helped tremendously.

{"post_id": "473429", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "James did you come to Forum because you are a caregiver? Or are you considering becoming a caregiver? Are there any reasons you came to the Forum? Did you have questions you wanted answered and did you post them? This is an elder care Forum. It involves people who for the most part are coming for HELP because they want answers. For instance someone yesterday was new to assuming Trustee and POA duties and had a question. For instance today someone is trying to deal with an in-law with an abandoned truck without a title. For instance someone is considering whether Hospice is appropriate. Whether they can report an incompetent Mom insisting on driving to the DMV. Whether Granny's giving money to grandson's college is \"gifting\". Whether a reverse mortgage is good or bad. For instance someone's Mom has a hacked email account. Someone's DIL feels unappreciated. Someone's Dad is clogging the plumbing. Someone keeps getting bladder infections. So yes absolutely PROBLEMS.  For the most part when things are GOOD you don't hear from that person.  As an RN I used to say: \"realize we are terrified about blood thinners because we see the ones with the side effects; most of the patients are home and doing well with years added to their lives\". If you don't need Forum then please don't stay here; we aren't meant to be a sad-movie-of-the-day for anyone.  I came here about four years ago quite desperate and afraid having been called by a Hospital at the other end of the state about my 82 year old bro in for a serious accident \"and oh by the way incidental finding of probably early Lewy's Dementia.Unless we are looking at stroke. And by the way there's a brain tumor looks old and calcified but still\". I was so afraid.  I was at the beginning of a years long journey to help my bro. To become his Trustee his POA to get his last home sold and help him move to ALF to help him adjust. My beloved brother is gone now and it WAS a journey and we had to get through it together as we had everything else in our lives my Gretel to his Hansel in the dark woods. I can't tell you what these people meant to me in terms of support. At the time I grabbed this Forum like a life preserver and I admit that now several years almost after my brother's death I admit--I am addicted! So James I can only say I am so happy you don't need us now and I hope you never do. And if you take on elder care or become elderly I hope you never have bad days in which you have questions or need support. I truly truly do hope that. But for now make out your POA and Will save up for aging make great friends enjoy life. Our best out to you.  Some here have become a \"close\" community in so far as Social Media goes. But if you head on over to my other favorite Facebook you will find a community that is great fun for you and you don't have to spend any more time on the problems of aging unless you wish to visit here. I do art there nature and animals and gardening and who watches Sister Wives. It's all great fun. My good man I know you are right. There are people out there right now elderly (I am 80 and OK thanks) or caring for elderly which I did as an RN all my career who are absolutely perfectly happy. Go find them and enjoy.

{"post_id": "473429", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "Ok. I have been taking care of my mom for the past 13 years. At age 70 she was in a devastating car accident that handicapped her for life. Her legs are like glass as she says. She is the strongest woman to go through what she went through. And now at age 83 she can get around a little and cook and plan and generally is pretty good. As for me taking care of her with the house shopping driving her to doctors and all kinds of stuff has improved my life exponentially. I see my main functions as keeping her from depression. Having her be happy. Protecting her from danger in the house. And watching over things. Keep life going for her and me. She would never be able to live here alone in this house. There are so many little things I do everyday that most people take for granted. But put all the little things aside. My mom would fall into deep depression being alone with no one to talk to and interact with. She has been in a rehab nursing facility for many months after the accident and she hated it. It almost killed her after the accident that almost did. She was transfered to a 2nd nursing home to be closer to home and there she begged the therapist there to let her come home saying being there was destroying her. She had yet to even stand up let alone walk yet. She had a fixator on one leg still. But they let me take her home after meeting with them. From there life got better and better for both of us. Took me a while to get my own terrible past out of my system but slowly day by day year by year it went away. Now life is so much better. God works in mysterious way.

About 10 inches long. Moves it's head in the direction of my voice. If it bites the bite is not toxic and won't hurt very much. So I should not be afraid but sad to say I am a bit eeked out.

You let me vent and you gave me warnings and support!!  My sister is on her way home now after about 1 week in hospital!! :) :) :)  I want to add some details below in case it helps someone in the future. Of course every case is different. \u2014\u2014  1. It was a good idea I refused anesthesia. I also refused invasive (stomach) testing. No point. My sister is elderly. Only risky. And even if they discover something we\u2019ll never operate.  2. Our urologist (not from hospital) (I was in constant contact) was right!! \u201cMaybe stomach ulcer\u201d (hospital doesn\u2019t know if there was an ulcer; we didn\u2019t do the invasive test to check) went away after calm. Our urologist said: he believes she never had an ulcer before the hospital and it suddenly appeared after hospitalization (due to stress of hospital stress from UTI + strong hospital medicine) (that was my initial instinct too).  Please be careful when you decide whether LO should go to hospital. There are risks. Sometimes there\u2019s no choice and you must go to the hospital.  We could have gotten our private urologist to see my sister at home treat at home. (Sometimes possible; depends how bad the situation is).  I didn\u2019t decide to bring my sister to the hospital. I was not home in that moment. The caregiver made the decision. The caregiver is a lovely competent person. We have agreed however that from now on my sister will not go to the hospital again without my consent (caregiver will call me). (Exception: falling possible broken bones ok to go to hospital without my consent).  3. My sister has always had some anemia (but every doctor has said it\u2019s OK). It\u2019s possible hospital decided unnecessarily to treat the anemia.  4. I have POA. My sister wants me to make decisions under some circumstances. The hospital doctors know. Next time they\u2019ll always ask my permission.  5. My sister was given blood transfusion against \u201cmaybe ulcer bleeding\u201d without my consent. That\u2019ll never happen again. (Day after being hospitalized she suddenly had bloody black stools. But then bleeding stopped some days later.)  6. UTI fine. They fixed it.   7. Blood transfusion:  please be careful before you accept.  Sometimes necessary to save life (then personal choice or religious if you want; if your family wants).  Sometimes not necessary (like my sister). It only adds more risk. My sister is full of energy healthy very good blood. Be careful before you agree to accept someone else\u2019s blood.  Anemia can be treated in many ways (blood transfusion not always necessary).  Ulcer bleedings can stop on their own (our urologist was right: he knows my sister\u2019s medical history well. He said this is from hospital stress medicine etc. It will stop on its own).  Please do research on blood transfusions: they are often over-used in hospitals (I\u2019m not talking about when you\u2019re in an accident bleeding).  8. Goooood luck everyone!!!!! My sister is very lucky. She\u2019s OK!!!  9. This is our personal decision: we will never accept blood transfusion for anemia. We will always look for alternative treatment. It\u2019s a personal choice. My sister doesn\u2019t want blood transfusion against anemia (they gave her blood but she was unfit/unwell to make a decision. She was in a daze/incoherent/confused. Hospital as said admits they should have asked me.)  Our bodies create new blood every 4 months. Then the donor blood in my sister\u2019s body will be replaced by her own new blood. Good.  10. My sister is soooo happy to be home. This ended very well.  11. Our private urologist comes to the house tomorrow to check.  12. Our private cardiologist comes to the house also to check all the results and try to reduce all the medicines back to how it was before hospital. (My sister only had 1 little pill 3 times a week).

If you are finding that you are being harmed (emotionally physically spiritually...) it is time to step back re-evaluate and make some changes to look after yourself better. You are the only one you can change. I found I had to increase emotional and physical distance to decrease the harm to me. Less contact stronger boundaries maintaining the consequences of breached boundaries.   It's very difficult for a person who has been abused in any way as a child to caregive the abuser(s). Don't underestimate that or your need for distance from the abuse or your need for distance and time and support to heal.", "date": "2022-04-02 21:47:44", "user_name": "golden23", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/general-topics-213495.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

One tends to summarize and not all facts are presented.  Here more facts:  I have POA. I\u2019m the brother.  My sister was in good health.   My sister doesn\u2019t have dementia.  In hospital - right now - not good for her to make decisions. Doctors agreed.   Doctor agreed they should have asked me. (I\u2019m not just family I\u2019m POA).  It\u2019s not that important to me that they didn\u2019t ask my permission. I know they did what they think is best:  give blood transfusion.  It appears now that blood transfusion was necessary. Not optional.  It is possible that 1 of the many reasons my sister feels so well now is because of the blood transfusion.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  Luckily there was no sepsis.  Just UTI not severe.  But suddenly \u201cmaybe bleeding ulcer\u201d. Suddenly anemia.  It\u2019s possible the ulcer was already there.  It\u2019s also possible it was caused by stress and strong medications in hospital. Our urologist (he\u2019s not from the hospital) said this now.  It\u2019s also possible there is no ulcer.  We won\u2019t do invasive testing/anesthesia. Too risky. And even if test says ulcer: we won\u2019t operate. Too risky. So no point to test. Our urologist agrees.   Our urologist is very optimistic about my sister: 1. the bleeding stopped today 2. it\u2019s possible it heals on its own at home calm no stress  We\u2019ll need luck.  Right now my sister feels very good.  Tomorrow she comes home!!!  Thanks for everyone\u2019s kind support!

{"post_id": "473532", "title": "I\u2019m only venting. No question. Stress. Worry. Sister in hospital.", "body": "UTIs if not treated can cause sepsis. The person also has Dementia like symptoms. I bet there was some dehydration too. This also will cause Dementia type symptoms.  Alva's the nurse so she will say if I am right or wrong. Anemia and stomach ulcers do not happen because of a couple of days in the hospital. These problems were before her stay and found when she entered the hospital. As explained if the ulcers were bleeding then your sister was losing blood the reason for the transfusions. Your sister should have been showing some signs. Like thinking it was stomach upset or heartburn. If she has ulcers she needs to watch her diet. No hot and spicy foods. No foods with high acid content. Before she leaves the hospital ask for a diet plan. If these ulcers don't heal she will be back in the hospital. Over the counter meds will not help.   You keep saying sister is elderly. I am 72 and do not consider myself elderly. If your sister is passed 80 she may start having health problems she did not have before. The UTI can be kept at bay by using cranberry tablets and a probiotic. Alva swears by D-Mannose. Because she may have ulcers I would check with her doctor if safe to use what I have suggested. She should be drinking plenty of water. When she uses the bathroom she should use wipes to clean herself well after toilet paper. I like Huggies. No soap near the urethra. Cotton panties because they breath.   As long as your sister is competent to make decisions a doctor does not need to talk to you. Even if you have medical POA if she is competent doctors don't need to talk to you. She can have you put on HIPPA paperwork or verbally say its OK to talk to you. HIPPA keeps doctors and nurses from being able to say more than \"she's comfortable\" or \"shes had a good day\". Patients have a right to privacy when it comes to their health. You as a sister gives you no legal rights. If you do not already have POA I would get it and have it immediate meaning it starts as soon as your sister signs it. This does not mean you make her decisions if she is competent just means you don't need a declaration of incompetence from a doctor if for any reason she is incompetent. Really the doctor does not have to discuss anything with family if your sister is competent to make informed decisions. It was a courtesy that he did so.   My daughter is an RN who worked in rehab/NH facilities. She had a Dementia patient that had only a sister who came to visit. Since the patient had Dementia she couldn't sign a HIPPA form. Even so my daughter would tell the sister how the patient was doing and what was being done until one day when the sister started ranting and raving about a bandaid that had been put on the patients hand for a skin tear. No one had called her. No they wouldn't because she had no POA or was she on the HIPPA form as a contact. My daughter could not calm her down and eventually had to be curt and tell the woman that she was lucky that my daughter had told her anything. What I am trying to say is just because your family you have no rights to your sisters health information if she is considered competent to make informed decisions. Your opinion is not relevent. You sister has the final say. Its between her and the doctor how her health is handled. Your sister can ask that you be present for any consults. This gives you the opportunity to ask questions. You can talk it over with ur sister but she has the final say. Which is the way it should be.   I will say this won't be the last time your sister will be hospitalized. These stays will be a lot easier if you understand the system. Be glad that a Doctor comes out and talks to you he doesn't have to.   Hope there r no more hospital visits and her healthcare can be handled by her PCP. Have sister fill out a HIPPA form for any doctor she sees or facility giving permission for you to obtain info on her health and ur an emergency contact.", "date": "2022-03-10 12:59:47", "user_name": "JoAnn29", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-only-venting-no-question-stress-worry-sister-in-hospital-473532.htm"},

I started this as a not entirely selfless exercise: I love gardening and it was something to do during visits to my mother which have always been a bit strained (but that\u2019s another story) and to keep getting outside through the winter months. It\u2019s been a bit like uncovering buried treasure. There were so many lovely shrubs and flowers just needing a bit of care. People have obviously planted things over the years for their elderly relatives and so it\u2019s a garden full of love. The early spring bulbs are now in flower and everything looks lovely. The real and unexpected bonus for me though is the joy it\u2019s brought to the residents. Some of them were once keen gardeners who are now unable to get stuck in but who still enjoy a walk round the garden to see what\u2019s in bloom. Others are a bit low after the winter covid and all the other world problems at the moment and have timidly stepped outside caught up by the enthusiasm of the others. One lady has a severe anxiety disorder but I have seen her looking at the spring daffodils with a smile on her face. Last week they gave me a box of chocolates for the work I\u2019d put in which was really unexpected and moved me to tears.

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge.

I'm curious why is your sister not able to speak for herself about what treatments or tests she wants?  Your sister must have consented to the transfusion right?  When my mother reached the age of 90 had had a stroke a broken hip and been diagnosed with vascular dementia we realized that there were no \"good\" solutions to her increasingly complex medical issues.  Is your sister very elderly and confused about her health? If she is in good health and doesn't have dementia and presents with a possible ulcer and internal blood loss I would certainly want an endoscopy done (under a local) to see if there is a bleeding ulcer. I'd also want to test for H. Pylori. I'd want a stool sample to test for occult blood.  Sometimes blood loss like your sister's is life-threatening and there is not the luxury to wait for the patient to take supplements and eat better. A transfusion absent other contraindications gives immediately relief and gives the docs time to figure out what is happening.

I can see that.But with most everyone else including her friends relatives and my two brothers she is yes very intense and hyper and tires one out fast but she is not mean and demanding like she is with me. Even my two brothers see how I am her whipping post.People who do know here like my sisters in law her primary care physician and others have wondered how I do it. Her PC doctor says she is in a room with my mom for ten minutes and is worn outHer independent living facility has a van which will take her to appointments certain times of the week within six miles and I thought we had an understanding that I will take her to things further than that if she takes the van when she can but she whines like a little kid saying none of her friends at her facility take the van.Anyway based on advice from this forum I have learned more how to set boundaries and say no. But then this ensues with constant griping and complaining and shaming. So I either give in or put up with this stuff.I live in a northern clime and would like to get away somewhere warm for a few weeks. (I am retired early but luckily am financial secure so need to be thankful for that but that just in her mind makes me more available). But she shames me when I say I want to go away a few weeks. Her own brother who is 95 and totally the opposite of her in terms of disposition and complaining has two daughters and a granddaughter who help with him They are going to Mexico for three weeks. Instead of complaining he tells me how happy he is they can take a break as they do so much for him. Instead my mom gripes saying I need to call every day. I said part of the reason frankly I am leaving is not only the weather but to get away from her constant spewing of anxieties every day. I say call one of my other brothers. She said one lives 1000 miles away and one works full time. I say I cannot be helpful if I am in Florida or somewhere. I remind my mom how her brothers kids are going to Mexico for three weeks and Charlie is happy about that. She responds but Charlies girls do so much for him otherwise And I dont I though? One time at a holiday event she said Kevin look how much Charlie's girls do for him. One of those very girls scolded my mom saying Jeannie my dad has three people watching over him you have ONE. You shoud appreciate that. Naturally it did not sink in.Last week it hit a head. I was on the phone with her forementioned brother while at her apartment trying to get information about the walker hearing aids etc he uses so I can help my mom more in what to choose. Then we chatted. She goes I want you to hang up now. I said Uncle Charlie my mom wants me to hang up so we did. Then she yells at me why I told Uncle Charlie I needed to hang up I should nothave said that. I said you should not have said that to begin with. She wonders why I cant alk to Charlie for ten minutes but not her. I said first of all I talk to Charlie once every three our four weeks so there is more to talk about unlike two or three times a day but also I added Charlie is pleasant to talk to she is not. I and I pointed out that her demand I hang up NOW is an example of how unpleasant she is to be withAnyway dont know what to do anymore.

Tell her you won't be calling during your vacation; and stick to it. Your mother is safe and well cared for; she is entitled to nothing further from you. Anything she gets from you is a privilege not an entitlement. If she is rude and/or demanding during face and phone conversations tell her you won't keep talking with her on those terms and leave/hang up. When you start implementing consequences be prepared that she will ramp up/accelerate the whining complaining shaming and guilt. Stick to your script. It will eventually lessen some of her behaviors. And you really should consider your mother's narcissistic behavior (for example you admit you are the 'whipping post'-another word for scapegoat. By letting her constantly treat you badly without repercussions is 'enabling'). (I refused to talk to or see my own 88 year old mother for over 8 months due to her very vicious mouth etc. This absence sent a very clear message to her that if she expected me to be around when she really needed help she would have to behave more civilly. I'm not suggesting something this drastic for you its simply by way of example of a 'consequence'. And the absence did work to some extent; she started reigning in her worse behaviors.) Bottom line: boundaries only work if you implement consequences. Make a list of your boundaries and next to each boundary write the consequence. Read your list every day. That is what I did.

My mom just turned 100 years old and is sharp as a tack (er...except when she isn't...we have our moments). She can't see well can't hear well isn't very mobile but in her heart of hearts she is still a vigorous young woman. She goes crazy if she doesn't have something to do. Sometimes I have to fib a little to keep her busy but if any of you have this problem here are a few things I do:0 Buy a cheap shredder and ask her for her help disposing of clutter. PROBLEM: You eventually run out of paper and things to shred but it's good while it lasts!0 Buy a fast photo scanner. I print documents from my Word files and ask her to scan in every morning. Here's where I feel a little guilty: I usually having her scan the same thing every day. Saves on printer paper!0 Go to the bank and get several rolls of coins. Ask her to separate them into baggies. If she can do it ask her to put them in wrappers.0 Ask her to sort white clothes from colored clothes before you put them in the laundry.0 Get a bunch of old towels (as many as possible) and go through your \"must go to Goodwill bags.\" Ask her to fold the towels and clothes.0 If she likes housekeeping (my mom doesn't which is probably why I'm a neat freak) ask her to do some dusting.0 Sit down and ask her advice...then listen seriously. She has decades of experience and you might learn something!0 Go to a YouTube or Audible that you think she might like then give her earphones make her comfortable and let her enjoy.0 If she doesn't mind reminiscing ask her to dictate the memories of her life or write them out.0 Envelope stuffing. Another one I feel guilty over but it does occupy her mind. Print out a hundred or so flyers (you can make them up yourself) put out a bunch of envelopes and tell her that a friend is starting a business and needs someone to help with the envelope stuffing. This one really makes me feel guilty. I don't like fibbing but I feel a little better when I see that it makes her feel like she is contributing.These are just a few tips. I'd love to hear yours! I can use all the help I can get!!! Here's to our moms and dads and their desire to still be helpful useful and busy. I know when I get to that age (God willing!)

Before I became my aunts primary care giver I did some...but limited it because I had a dog I felt bad about leaving AND couldn't find a petsitter. My husband travelled a lot for work and I missed many international trips.  But finding people to dog sit (at the time - he's passed away now) was a challenge where I live so I finally had to decide to kennel him at Petsmart for one trip and regretted it when I came back seeing he had not had proper potty breaks during the 10 days we were gone. Hence my reluctance to travel and leave him. On a different note the same has been true for finding respite workers and caregivers when it comes to my Aunt. I live in a semi rural area in the PNW and I've made multiple attempts to find somebody to come just a for weekend and there is nobody available. This includes going outside of my area and being willing to pay extra. They either don't call back or say they don't come out to where I live or that there is a shortage of caregivers and companions.  Further my Aunt doesn't like it when we leave the house even for a couple of hours which only happens about once every 2 months if that.

It is Feast: True Love in and out of the Kitchen. I just finished Jamie Raskin's book Unthinkable about January 6th and about the suicide of his son. Highly recommend. A wonderful man who tries hard to see both sides. And what an education: For instance at 80 I never knew that until 1913 it was our Congress who elected our Senators not \"we the people\". Most profound from him is this quote which shows how differently we think in our country how divided we are: \"As the senaors exit and the House members resume their usual places I look to my left and see the Democrats and to my right I see the Republicans. I recall a conversations I have with a Republican colleague Rep. Clay Higgins of LA. once when we were sitting on the floor. 'What do you see when you look out over our side and then over your side'? I asked Clay who is a good- natured man with an awesome Cajun accent. \"He looked at me and said 'you tell me first'. 'When I look at our side' I said 'I see America today in all its glory; black white hispanic asian-American LGBTQ straight gay women men immigrants native-born. And when I look at your side I see America in the 50s.' (Clay replied) 'When I look at your side he said I see the Coasts New York and California. When I look at my side I see the heartland'. End of quote from this book. Really if we could just think and talk to the \"other side\" how much we could learn about the differences we all feel see believe. And how much more alike we might admit to be in our thinking than the rhetoric we are forced into when forced to \"choose\" those sides?

Drop her a** off at a hospital ER and tell them you're done and can't do it anymore. Or pack her bags and pick a sibling. Then leave her and her belongings on their doorstep. Ring the bell once and drive away. I see some of the stories on this forum and I say OMG! big-time. I'm able to be a caregiver to my mother. We have been able to come to an amicable arrangement that is beneficial to us both because she knows I'd do exactly one of those two things.  I don't play any games. I don't tolerate a moment of stubbornness or instigating or gaslighting or guilt-tripping or passive/aggressive nonsense. I won't have any drama or 'performances' to get attention or to sabotage a special occasion. I do right by her but it's on my terms not hers. She also knows that if dementia shows up to the party I will stop being her caregiver. My sister does not help out but she's least decent and has some respect.

As a mother she has dominated every aspect of her children's life.", "body": "First rule is protect yourself. You are no good to anyone in this world if she destroys you and your joy.  It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him. Quite to the contrary the more I loved him the worse he treated me. I was trained by my mother who was very similar to him so my whole life I have been destroyed by jealous people. The more they tortured me the more I needs validation so I threw myself into my work and my hobbies. As a result I became more successful which only made things worse. I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave. I filed for divorce because he is going to keep caregivers refuses to go to Assisted Living until he uses up all his savings. At that point I realize his wife (me) would have to pay his expenses thus using up all my savings leaving me with nothing for when I can no longer care for myself. My kids see only the fake dad the perfect one making me look like the evil person. I have lost them we still see each other but it is very strained. My advice to you go no contact. She will destroy you. You deserve better. You will feel the weight is lifted off of you. Don't feel guilty. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about. Send cards and call. Don't go.

{"post_id": "473805", "title": "Move where you want, not because of housing prices. Right?", "body": "I would never be in the camp of moving where you want regardless of costs to live there. I don't know when it started that people decided (to live on credit cards) to live the life they want; it's been prevalent at least the last 20 years.  I moved around a lot in my earlier years always living beneath my means or right at them b/c I had no choice. As I aged and my income increased I still lived beneath my means.   This offers a lot of opportunities. Freedoms. Less stress. I could change jobs if I wanted even if they offered less money. There came a time where I didn't have to sweat the big stuff when it rolled around (and big stuff is always right around the corner). Etc.  I'm not motivated by money but you need it. That said I tried to work jobs that gave me purpose or enjoyment whatever...but none offered a salary that you see these days. I never got above middle-middle class and then that was only because of a single job I held for 14 years and combined with my husband's income.  Now that I'm in my older years it's paid off in ways that end up very important yet in reality I hadn't considered them as such.   We bought a bit of a fixer-upper 20 years ago b/c it checked all the boxes of what we wanted and was purchased for less than what we were approved for .   Sunk a lot of CASH into the house; didn't even have a credit card then(!).  The 30-year mortgage was paid off in 14 years.  My credit score even without credit cards was 810 or 820. (My husband had the same mindset as me--live beneath your means--which made life a lot easier to navigate.) His credit score without credit cards was 820.  When we started buying new vehicles b/c we tired of used we got excellent interest rates. We were able to buy two new vehicles in one day b/c even though we weren't \"well off\" we had a nice discretionary income and stellar credit. (We'd both been able to buy two new vehicles we always wanted--another win!)  We didn't live a dull life b/c of our approach. He was a musician on the side--very expensive. We had Harleys (one at a time) and he was finally able to buy a brand new one; it was paid off a year early. And of course he was a guy so he had big-boy toys. None of it was a problem.  I'm now a widow and my income is waaay down but the house is paid off my expenses are covered. I don't have to stress about this or that getting shut off or bill collectors etc. And b/c I keep expenses down there is the occasional month that rolls around here and there where I'm actually able to put a few extra hundred dollars aside beyond what I put in my budget to save. (Though I've been known take a bit of that to the casino lol.)  It's less about saving more about living in a manner that allows you to live with less stress or worrying about the \"what-ifs.\" I'd rather have a nice little house than a \"better\" one I could lose b/c of the economy job loss death/divorce etc.  No matter how much money the average working person makes they're only a paycheck away from potential disaster.

Today on Facebook I received a message from a friend of my mothers. She want me to call her. Which I did.    it\u2019s so sad this woman was very helpful when my mom had gotten distrustful with my sister and me. She worked my mother. She helped with my mothers financial issues which my mom did not trust us.   she told me today that her sister has dementia she lives in Utah. This friend of my mothers live in California where I lived. A family member had her placed in a faculty which she escaped from and ended up in Wyoming.   this friend of my mothers (name is Nancy) Nancy is dying from cancer and can\u2019t go to Utah to help. This family member in Utah did get POA. How can they help her when she is difficult and combative?   I suggested they find a doctor or neurologist who specializes in dementia get her on an anti depressant even if it is capsule that they can open to put in her food or something like a juice. Find a facility that has a security system where they use a security bracelet on her sister so if she tries to leave the bracelet will set off alarms. My understanding is the family member trying to take care of Nancy\u2019s sister is older as well.   Nancy says she can\u2019t talk with her sister because she gets difficult accusing them of taking her money and home from her. I suggested redirecting her thoughts to things they know her sister enjoys\u2026.knitting gardening etc.   I also suggested if there is a family member who can gain her trust a granddaughter/grandson/niece etc that can help as well. If you all remember my mom did not trust my sister yet she trusted me and I could work with my mom to get her to be more cooperative.   if any of you have more suggestions to help Nancy I would appreciate it. Nancy was a blessing to us and I want to try to help her any way I can", "date": "2022-03-27 02:12:33", "user_name": "SharynMMarie", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

{"post_id": "473890", "title": "Has anyone been accused of murder by a LO with dementia?", "body": "Loved ones always deserve our respect. How can you take such an accusation seriously when dementia is at play then question whether MIL 'deserves' commitment time and/or respect or just to be left alone or does that mean totally ignored? My mother said a LOT of mean &amp; nasty things to me while riddled with dementia. If I took each one to heart &amp; decided she no longer deserved my respect or attention I'd have ditched her years ago &amp; made her a ward of the state. Instead I chalked the majority of her angst off to the disease and continued to do my best to make sure she was well cared for in her Memory Care AL. She was pretty far gone from reality during the last 6 months of her life but again not due to anything she brought on herself but due to advanced dementia robbing her of her mind. What I did for her was out of love and what I felt to be the right thing to do on MY part nothing else.   When she got particularly nasty I'd back off on the phone calls and visits for a while to let things calm down mostly ME. The next time I'd see her or speak to her it was like nothing had ever happened b/c she didn't remember she'd said something foul. Again the nature of the beast. The breaks were for ME more so than anything to give ME a chance to calm down &amp; regroup. It's never easy to deal with a demented elder to say the least but if it's a loved one we're in charge of via POA or just b/c of love then we have to do what we have to do regardless. If your MIL was accusing you of such ridiculous things while LUCID well that would be another story entirely.   Give her a break from your visits and then pick back up like nothing ever happened. She won't remember saying that she wants nothing to do with you ever again I can practically guarantee it. By tomorrow she'll be off on a different tangent entirely.   So to answer your question yes elders far gone from reality do deserve commitment time and respect from individuals and from society b/c they are human beings suffering from a disease they didn't ask for and cannot help having *in my opinion*. I think we all argue back with outrageous accusations however when the better thing to do is just leave the room.   Like Barb suggested though do have her checked out by the doctor b/c a sudden change to aggressive behavior can indicate a medical problem going on in her body.

That\u2019s not my personal email though it\u2019s a company email.  I thought The whole point of this forum was how coming from dysfunctional families can add weight to caregiving. My only purpose of sharing something either from my own personal experience website or information I know of that was to share something supportive of caregivers.   Because of my knowledge and experience of the many issues and daily challenges of caregivers especially individuals working 24/7 without a support system my purpose is to help outside siblings to see that their daily challenges is everyone\u2019s problem and crisis in the family. This is especially true if the person is a sick parent with adult children.   We hear a lot about caregiving burnout and how this can take a physical and emotional toll on the caregivers health but unless you are the sibling working without support you may not be aware of what they go through.   I\u2019ve seen videos and information a wealth of information that shows if that Main Family Caregivers health breakdown then the family could have two sick people needing help the caregiver and the person needing care and the burden of responsibility could fall on another sibling unexpectedly.   I know of a personal experience where this happened in a family that did not communicate like they should with each other about their mothers health with dementia. One weekend out of no where that sibling decided to take Momma to visit another sibling for the weekend with the intention of leaving her. This is exactly what they did and overnight that siblings life and household changed.   This is why for families that can put aside any differences when a love one needs total care if they can have a plan of action in place and learn how to work together it can take some of the load off of just one individual and the burden of responsibility does not have to be placed abruptly on another sibling.   When a medical situation happens that forces a family member to need total care many families are at a lost of what to do. This only adds to an already dysfunctional family. How nice it is if people are aware that there may be other options task and responsibilities each member can take on. But is starts by members being willing to put aside their differences and look at the problem at hand as \u201cOur Family Crisis Our Family Emergency.\u201d", "date": "2022-03-26 00:52:10", "user_name": "LynnelT4shs", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

I agree it is so hard for individuals especially the Main Family Caregiver to convince other siblings living outside of the home of what Never Ending Caregiving can do to the caregiver Physically and Emotionally!   It is for this reason I created an online program to help these individuals AND THEIR OUTSIDE SIBLINGS see that this crisis is EVERYONES crisis. I demonstrate the sad consequences and reality of what can happen if these individuals are not supported and give practical suggestions and a list of at least 10 task these outside siblings can do to be supportive even if they live in another state.

But if your LO is in a place with little or no distractions I don't think one has to make activities into a dog-and-pony show: just talk to the admin and ask if you can come once a week/month whatever to entertain the people. But you should commit to a regular schedule and confirm with the admin prior to every appearance so that you can be looped in on their schedule changes. Maybe do it right after one of the meals so the staff doesn't have to gather participants in one place? Gathering people will tax the staff and burn up a lot of time. It can be like herding cats. If residents' LOs are informed of the activity and invited to just bring their LO and be present you may develop a pool of interested volunteers.   When my son was young he went to a non-profit daycare/preschool and \"Grandma Pat\" used to come and have storytime with the older kids once a week. She was just a neighborhood Granny (or attended the church that housed the preschool) and I don't think she even had a relative at that daycare. She was greated like a rock star when she came (and she was very advanced in years).   I've served on several boards of non-profit organizations that depend on volunteers and although it sounds lovely in theory it has proven challenging to keep the same volunteers coming on the same schedule. Retired people don't seem to like being on a committed schedule anymore (not that I blame them). In the summertime teenagers who are too young to work may be a good pool of helpers or entertainers. Some highschools now required some community service (in the US) as part of their graduation requirement. Boy or Girl Scouts (if they can stop peddling cookies for a minute). Maybe talk to a church youth group pastor (they are often grateful for ideas and outlets for their kids). It will be easier to solicit help if your activity has a defined beginning and end date because it will be a more tolerable commitment.

By the end of the day there is a feeling of calmness and love that is all encompassing. Why not try it?

For I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength. Philippians 4:13  Don\u2019t worry about anything; instead pray about everything.

Go to Wal-Mart and get some bath bombs bubble bath a good smelling candle. Take a favorite book and have your own spa night after mom is asleep for the night!

Hospice as it began in this country--a real mission and a vocation-- I fear it is much changed. I first noticed this when my friend told me \"how it is now\" in that the patient gets so many RN hours so many aide hours for a bath several times a week and until the very end very little else though the costs charged to medicare are enormous. I am afraid things are changed a whole lot. Do I still recommend Hospice? Yes and always but I think it bears more thinking about on our own part. When my brother went into Hospice for end of life (and coming quick) care the Hospital-recommended Hospice and the ALF-recommended Hospice virtually had a fight for the body. I am afraid this has all descended into the area of profits and who gets them. Just food for thought. Hospice is the best we have. But be a bit careful now in which one you choose.

{"post_id": "473503", "title": "Moving Mom", "body": "Well we moved Mom into the Memory Care Facility with the small house concept and 16 maximum residents last 3/10/21. Yep Thursday 3/10/22 will be moving out day for her one year to the day from when she got there. I gave it my best shot to try to get her the care she needs but it just was not available there for lots of reasons mainly due to the caregivers.Sure if you can walk and talk and dress yourself and feed and toilet yourself you will do great where Mom is! Most of the residents in her \"house\" can do all those things. You would think that would give the caregivers extra time to be able to work with the residents who can not do all those (or any of those) things like my Mom. There are only three out of 15 residents who need that high level of individual care. But it did not work that way. The caregivers for the most part preferred to be sitting in the kitchen area on their phones texting instead of providing care for the residents who needed extra care. And since my Mom can not speak she could not ask for what she might be needing.Mom can't walk but constantly had bruises and cuts on her arms and legs. I once watched a couple of caregivers transfer Mom on to the toilet and it was as if they were heaving a sack of potatoes. She developed a pressure sore on her buttocks and the caregivers were told by the nurse to reposition Mom every two hours. Did they? Never when I was there which was every day for several hours at a time. They were supposed to check her for wetness every few hours since she suffered from one UTI after another. Mostly they just put her in her bed or in her recliner and left her and went about their business.Of course I mentioned these things to the caregivers and finally went to the Executive Director to voice my concerns about Mom's care. This went on for almost a year. Sure promises were made that the staff would be addressed and reminded of what they should be doing. For a day or so things would seem to get better but then it was right back to \"business as usual.\"Yes I know Covid created many difficulties for community care facilities. That is why I waited until after the worst part of Covid(at the time) was over to place Mom. The facility where she lived promised that our \"house\" would always have a House Manager plus 2 caregivers on duty for each shift (except overnight where there would only be one caregiver). In the year Mom was there we had a House Manager for only 4 months. The rest of the time it was only two caregivers (and they seemed to be different people every day with the use of lots of agency caregivers)who had to cook 3 meals tend to the residents and clean the house and do the laundry!! Not much time left for quality care.I found a Residential Small Group Home that is actually in my neighborhood (.8 mile away) that gets wonderful reviews and has 6 residents with two caregivers. I like those odds better! The cost is also less than where she was. I hope and pray Mom gets the care here that she needs and has a chance for more socialization with residents who are more \"like her\".We'll see I guess. I am expecting some decline with the confusion of moving to a new place but she will have her furniture pictures etc. And I can be there every day to provide continuity. She is under Hospice care now so that will be even more hands-on care for her. I'll post again to update on how things are going.

I think an aide should be paid at least $30 per hour. This is back-breaking work. It is undervalued and oftentimes leads to back trouble etc. These private companies want the most work for the least amount of $$$.  Keep in mind gas has gone up so that's another issue with the bottom line. CNA's need to unionize and be paid a just and fair wage. My Lord you could sell mascara online from your kitchen table with that low of pay.  It is my opinion that many of the refugees in Europe will be the caregivers of the elderly. Take for example Italy where the population growth is at an all-time low since no one is having children and the millennials are forced to leave their country and seek work in other places. Who cares for the loved ones left behind?  During the Pandemic the Eastern European Refugees were caring for the elderly in Europe (Italy) when all of a sudden they had no place to go. Children came for their parents and the refugees were basically left homeless and they couldn't fly anywhere.  Caregiving is dirty work. When I look at what athletes are paid I can't get over it. Wouldn't it be nice if family took their loved ones in but it doesn't always work that way for a number of reasons.  It shouldn't be treated where we look at caregiving like ok you are lucky not to be living in a worn-torn country we are taking you into our country you're lucky you can find work have the refugees do it. This demanding grueling work should be paid in a dignified manner including--medical dental prescription eyecare pension 10 sick days/vacation gas mileage and paid training on a continuing basis CPR Training etc. and a classy uniform. It's watered down to custodial work and these are human beings on both sides the caregiver and the patient.

The last private caregiving agency I worked at was excited to let me know during orientation that they were generously giving me five whole sick days!

She told me she was hired given our address told to call about the times and sent here. It's alright at this time as all she has to do is be here while I make a grocery run or have an appointment of my own.

Medical aides are also offered at this agency not sure yet if the costs are the same.   The baby boom generation is following along behind many of us and they are more demanding more entitled just more people aging at the same time.

{"post_id": "473429", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "Here's how the cow chews the cud James: support groups are formed because there's a need for support. There's a need for support on a site like this b/c caregivers to elders in general are burned out exhausted and devastated b/c they've devoted their lives to loved ones who basically do not appreciate their effort; who complain &amp; treat them like dirt in return. So we're here to vent; to ask for help ideas tips support and to hear that we're not alone when we feel like we're falling off the edge of the Earth. You're not hearing positive stories b/c there are very FEW positive stories to share. Aside from yours that is.  You on the other hand are in an atypical situation where you're thrilled to be caring for your mom for the past 14 years thrilled to have given up your former life to do so thrilled to be 'relaxing' and to have quit your job given up your freedoms friends girlfriends concerts and all the rest of it in exchange for your caregiving duties. Which is great for YOU and you should be applauded for your devotion to your mother who apparently loves &amp; appreciates all of your efforts.  But that scenario is suited to probably 3% of the planet if that in reality. So to come here to this forum and expect to hear YOUR stories uplifting and 'non-depressing' stories such as the one you're telling is about as likely as a snowstorm in Florida in August truthfully. You don't like people telling you how YOUR story is off-the-wall yet you're here telling us OUR stories are off the wall or depressing? This is OUR reality James and for us it's an UGLY reality whether you agree with it or not. Because caregiving to elders IS a hard &amp; ugly job as you may find out yourself if your mother becomes incontinent &amp; dementia ridden &amp; starts playing with her feces &amp; spreading it all over the walls the bed &amp; the furniture. Then you may decide to come back to AC &amp; seek some of the support you once found to be 'so depressing' huh?  The vast majority of us are not 'relaxing' or 'enjoying' our time watching TV or fiddling around on a computer. I can tell you I DO have a cell phone which rang continuously with calls from my parent's ALF with them telling me of mom's falls all 95 of them. With calls from their doctors and nurses and hospice and EMTs and ambulance companies and specialists and hospitals and rehabs and mortuaries and moving companies for the SEVEN MOVES I've made for them and and AND. Because for most of us that's part of Real Life which you have managed to bow out of for the most part aside from staying home and relaxing and answering calls from your mother which you 'don't mind doing at all'. Which is your prerogative certainly.  But please reserve YOUR judgment for US like you've been telling US to do for YOU.  I don't like Twitter; I find it depressing and rather offensive.

{"post_id": "472748", "title": "Argumentative, OCD, hoarding, bizarre behavior - could be low serotonin levels (and what helped my mom)", "body": "Thought I would share my experience in case others have the same problem since it helped in my case. TL DR: strange behavior and bad attitude / disagreeableness were 90% caused by low serotonin levels and I was able to greatly improve them.Short background: I had to step up as caregiver for my mom late last year since she could no longer be counted on to take care of herself (ate poorly - not enough good food - craved junk food but still underweight). In trying to help her I noticed some behaviors from her that she had never shown before.Any time I tried to get her to do something there would be an argument. If I told her she needed to do something or I offered a new idea she would disagree before three words left my mouth. She started to horde things (in her bedroom her chair in the living room the kitchen table). She'd get easily distracted while eating - if she saw a plastic bag on the kitchen table she'd pick it up and start futzing with it. It was so bad I had to clear everything off the table and hide things just to get her to eat.Then the bizarre behavior - weird bathroom habits / obsessions walking around without pants / underwear. Insisting that our Senator was on the radio late at night giving recommendations on what to eat (it was a late night talk show host reading commercials). Couldn't be convinced of anything that went against what she thought was true.She went on and on about old things that upset her - when I would address one she'd move on to another thing then another and then circle back to the first item in a never ending loop.She has Alzheimer's but this was a rapid progression from where she was just months before. She mentioned not sleeping so I started researching natural substances to help her sleep. Along the way I saw someone mention low serotonin levels causing problems like she was having. I found a video that listed these symptoms: (don't know if I can post links but the video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_IiJmIL9ss&amp;t=516s)- Frequent feeling of sadness - Constant worrying - Upset when things don't go your way (rigid/inflexible) - Upset when things are out of place - Tend to be oppositional or argumentative - Repetitive negative thoughts - You don't like change - Tend to hold grudges - Trouble shifting attention from subject to subject - Trouble shifting behavior from task to task - Difficulty seeing options - Tendency to hold on their own opinion and not listening to others - Tendency to be locked in a course of action - Needing to have things done in a certain way - Others complain that you worry too much - Tend to say \"no\" without thinking - Tend to predict fearShe had every one of them.I found people suggesting Saint John's Wort to help with low serotonin levels. I found a bottle of liquid SJW drops without a bunch of chemicals and ordered it. Those two days waiting for amazon to deliver took forever. While waiting I cleared it with her doctor to make sure it wouldn't affect her regular medication.I started with one drop in a glass of water. No side effects so I went to 2. Soon It was up to 3 drops in the morning and 2 at night. Along the way all the bad behavior started to slowly improve. She stopped arguing about every little thing. She didn't mind when my sister or I cleaned up the clutter that she didn't want to get rid of just weeks ago. Her actions were more rational her obsessions were greatly reduced. She could eat without without getting distracted by everything (but she still eats too slow - can't change 80 year old habits).Her poor sleep habits still cause problems but as long as I keep the SJW flowing all the symptoms she had are greatly reduced.If you have a LO with similar problems check out serotonin levels. Diet changes can help SJW worked for my mom but make sure to check with their doctor first - SJW can interfere with meds (like heart medications) so you definitely don't want to start it without getting approval.", "date": "2022-01-31 09:59:29", "user_name": "Thought", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Behavior Change", "Medications", "Mental Health"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/argumentative-ocd-hoarding-bizarre-behavior-could-be-low-serotonin-levels-472748.htm"},

Austin Miles 1912  Songwriters C. Austin Miles Published by Public Domain The Story Behind In The Garden Here is the account of how this beautiful hymn was written from the hymn writer C. Austin Miles himself \u201cOne day in April 1912 I was seated in the dark room where I kept my photographic equipment and also my organ. I drew my Bible toward me and it opened at my favorite book and chapter John chapter twenty. I don\u2019t know if this was by chance or by the work of the Holy Spirit. I will let you the reader decide. That story of Jesus and Mary in\u00a0 John 20\u00a0had lost none of its power and charm. It was though I was in a trance as I read it that day I seemed to be part of the scene. I became a silent witness to that dramatic moment in Mary\u2019s life when she knelt before her Lord and cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I rested my hands on the open Bible as I stared at the light blue wall. As the light faded I seemed to be standing at the entrance of a garden looking down a gently winding path shaded by olive branches. A woman in white with head bowed hand clasping her throat as if to choke back her sobs walked slowly into the shadows. It was Mary. As she came unto the tomb upon which she placed her hand she bent over to look in and ran away. John in a flowing robe appeared looking at the tomb. Then came Peter who entered the tomb followed slowly by John. As they departed Mary reappeared leaning her head upon her arm at the tomb she wept. Turning herself she saw Jesus standing there so did I. I knew it was He. She knelt before Him with arms outstretched and looking into His face cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I awakened in sunlight gripping my Bible with my muscles tense and nerves vibrating under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. I wrote as quickly as the words could be formed the lyrics exactly as it is sung today. That same evening I wrote the tune. It is sung today as it was written in 1912.\u201d", "date": "2022-04-03 23:27:31", "user_name": "smeshque", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/count-your-blessings-435930.htm"},

You have diabetes too that needs to be under control.  After she is stable you should see a change in her. It may take a while but you should see a change. If she still shows signs of a Dementia then you need to see a Neurologist to give u that diagnosis.  I would not consider Hospice until she is stable and has physical therapy. Then you can go from there. At this point I wouldn't overwhelm myself. Take it one step at a time. She is in the hospital for now then hopefully rehab.

A couple of days ago my dad caused some emergencies at home. While I was trying to deal with them he kept calling on my mom to help him get clothes and other things he wanted (despite me repeatedly telling him not to). Since she has problems remembering things she couldn't follow through half the time then he'd get upset when he had no right to.   All that stress and everything else going on basically overloaded her - it got her so wound up that the benefits of SJW couldn't keep up. Now I'm trying to bring her back down to earth.  The next day (Actually early AM) she was acting obsessive about a financial matter that had been handled years ago. 3 people couldn't convince her it was handled it took her calling my brother (while at work) who handles that end that she was in fact wrong. And today she was back to obsessing about eating the horrible junk food that makes her worse. It's not happening with every little thing like it was before but she's latching on to some things like she did months ago.   Now I just have to work to get her to stay calm and relaxed and remind my dad repeatedly that I'm the one he should be calling when something needs to be done not my mom.  As far as treating low Serotonin. SJW isn't the only option but it's one of the few I can use with her. Meditation can help but she's not one for that. I tried 10hz meditative music (alpha brainwave frequencies) which helps me relax - but she hates that. Improving diet helps but I struggle just to get her to eat enough to maintain weight. Light therapy can help too but getting her to do it and juggle her and my dad is getting more and more difficult.  Beyond that is heavy duty psych medications but I'd rather avoid the side effects and she hates pills as it is so those are out. So SJW has become the easiest most reliable thing. I just wish it didn't give me a headache when I take it - because I could use it too with all the stress.  Anyway if anyone is out there experiencing the same I hope they find this and at least look into low serotonin levels as part of the cause of those problems.", "date": "2022-02-02 20:03:27", "user_name": "Thought", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/argumentative-ocd-hoarding-bizarre-behavior-could-be-low-serotonin-levels-472748.htm"},

But there are also other options - *non-family helpers*. Let's face it not all family members are cut out to be helpers! Just like we are not all cut out to be accountants lawyers or podiatrists (no offence!)  Not enough aunties to babysit? You hire a babysitter. Same concept.

Requests for money. Requests for time. Requests for care assistance.For the most part I have fended them off. But I do what I am comfortable with and that is all. I am often judged by others for this. Aunts Uncles family friends. But those others do not know what I have been through and were never there to assist me when I needed it. So I don't care. Their opinions are irrelevant. They mean nothing to me and I never have anything to do with them anyways. Aunty or Uncle status means nothing. They are basically strangers. Every source of support in my life has always come from outside of the bloodlines.Now in my 30s I have been the victim of neglect and abuse as a child and have never had any support in my life from my family. Neither emotional nor financial. So why should I drop anything now just because the remaining parent is old and infirm? I am not grateful for what has been done to me. I have always had to do everything for myself and fend for myself.I do feel bad for the remaining parent and I do not want them to suffer. But I also don't want my life dragged down by it and I wont let that happen. I am just going to do as much as I am happy to do and that is all.What tops it off and makes me even more angry is the parent arranged for all inheritance to go the step parent. I know it sounds entitled of me to complain about this but I don't care. After their gross lack as a parent the least they could have done for me is leave some kind of legacy rather than give it all to a step-parent who was part of the abuse and who I utterly despise. Part of that money also includes money left from the parent who I did love who passed a long long time ago and from two sets of grandparents. And they can't even leave me a cent. And yet there still is an expectation for me to be there at the beck and call and drop everything after all of this and they cannot even do that.Children of abusive parents - do not let yourself be pressured by others who know nothing of your circumstances into over -extending yourself to look after them when they are old. Stuff them. If they were never there to help you when you were vulnerable and needed support they are IRRELEVANT.Parents - be careful of how you treat your children because you reap what you sew. And if you abuse your children they will not look after you when you are old.

{"post_id": "472553", "title": "Do you feel guilty?", "body": "I read many posts where a caregiver feels guilty about what they've done or not done with respect to their LOs` care. The feeling of guilt is often associated with the commission of an illegal act. But many guilt feelings have nothing to do with illegal acts but instead are about what a caregiver did or didn't do in caring for their LO.Whether caring for your parents your spouse or another LO you may feel guilt if - You were a difficult child You mistreated your LO before their diagnosis You wished your LO died You placed your LO in a care facility You wanted time apart from your LO You got angry with LO You feel guilty for what you should have done or what you didn't do. Etc. etc.None of these are illegal \u201cshould have\u201d or \u201cshouldn't have\u201d feelings but they are feelings of guilt nevertheless. Often the feelings of guilt are part of the grieving process. The two can co-exist. But one can grieve w/o guilt. One can also feel guilt outside of the grieving process. Guilt can be overcome and grieving can be more difficult and last longer but can also be worked through. All of the above feelings I mention above don't have to result in guilt.Realizing there is no playbook for dementia care and that you're doing your best can help fight off the guilt trips. Although there are many resources that can help manage the caregiving experience no two experiences are alike so it's mostly a matter of on the job learning. Videos of Teepa Snow books like The 36 Hour Day Surviving Alzheimer's and Learning to speak Alzheimer's can be very helpful but may not apply to your situation. You may have to \u201cfigure it out\u201d. Dr. Peter Rabins coauthor of the 36 Hour Day offers ways to prevent guilt in caring for a LO.

{"post_id": "472809", "title": "I would rather be an only child", "body": "The definition of anger is \"an unmet expectation\". Many many of us expect family and siblings to rally around to contribute an equal amount to the care of our elders only to be shocked and gravely disappointed and then angry. That being said no one can be assumed into a caregiving role and your siblings are under no moral or ethical obligation to care for their parents (and morality means their own not yours).   So you need to decide if you can come to having peace in your heart to being the only caregiver.   Next are you able to be the only caregiver? Do you have PoA for one or both of them? If so then you also have the ability to be the only one to make decisions in their (and your) best interests. You do not need to have any input or consensus about their care with your siblings. The caregiving arrangement only works if it works for both the care receiver and giver. If it is onerous to you you must find other solutions before you burnout.   You can choose to keep going along the same path down a road of bitterness or to make changes. If you are not the PoA then this is an issue. If no one is their PoA you must work to convince them to assign this responsibility to someone and the logical person right now is you (if you want to keep managing and providing their care). Please do this before they enter cognitive decline or they may not be legally able to assign a PoA at that point.

I was also the only D and my parents ended up settling in my city 10 mins away. After my father died my mother slowly started failing but it didn't get bad until she stopped driving at age 90 in 2016. I became her chauffeur and she didn't like it when I placed boundaries about that.   One good thing that I did was to send my 3 brothers an email when I'd been with my mother telling them what I did how she was and how long it took. This was smart on my part since they would otherwise have had no idea how time-consuming she'd become for me.   My 3 brothers are out of state and it took quite a while before they started seeing what I was seeing as she could showtime. Eventually a gall bladder infection landed her in the hospital for 17 days then rehab then LTC in the NH where she finished rehab. Previously to this hospitalization she lived \"independently\" in a condo with the only help being a cleaner once a month (she was fastidiously neat and tidy). She refused to hire help with bathing which she needed. I didn't offer to help and don't know if she would have even allowed it. She sure accepted my help when I stayed with her for 8 long days and nights with some kind of muscle ache a few years prior. She became nearly helpless at that time.   She threatened to cut me out of the trust. She did cut me and one of my brothers out of being POA so that left 2 brothers with joint POA (each could act independently). (One of these brothers took her to the attorney on one of his rare visits -- he later claimed he had no idea what she did at that visit.) At this point she was in the hospital about to transition to rehab. My mental health was being affected and I told the main POA brother that I needed compensation if I was to continue on in my role. He readily agreed and agreed to compensate me with back pay also. (I'd brought up the issue of compensation with my mother previously and she'd gotten indignant and disgusted telling me \"You don't pay family!\")   Just as well that I wasn't POA -- now the POA could pay me $20/hour. (The POA couldn't pay themselves.) No taxes taken out I simply sent my brother an accounting of my hours and he paid from that. My mother would never qualify for Medicaid. Things got better from that point on because I considered it just a job. I had threatened that since I wasn't POA that one of my 2 POA brothers could move her to be near them.   My mother had made it clear (no filters) that I'd always been a disappointment to her was a nasty person was trying to cheat her out of her money etc. She even wrote a disjointed note at the NH to tell one of my brothers (got the name wrong) at the wrong address (was kind of HER brother's address).

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "I wish I had been able to access your letter 20 years ago! In a nutshell both of my parents were toxic. My mother was cold and emotionally distant and my father was a malignant narcissist. When they were still young and healthy they moved near me and my family. My kids were able to develop a relationship with them because they were good to my children. Good grandparents. Poor parents.  It started slowly. They needed help for this or that we didn't think anything of helping them out. I did not sign on to become their main caregiver. I have three other siblings who lived too far away to help. Mom started having real issues along with severe dementia and my father refused to place her. He would take care of her and when I came over once a week I'd spell him. I didn't want to have to bathe her change her poopy pants take her pills or try to appease whatever delusions she had. And he wasn't capable of taking care of her. Eventually he realized she had to be placed it was more than he could handle.   She died and he fell apart. I had to have him hospitalized three times that year and every time he was angry with me. How dare I take him to the emergency room because I thought he was septic? This brilliant man also developed dementia. He started accusing me of stealing his money. I wasn't stealing his money I was paying his bills because he had refused to sign a POA. Was I supposed to let his lights go out? Not have TV? I accessed his bank account with his permission and paid everything online. With his paranoia he told my brother I was doing \"nefarious things\" at the bank and taking his money. So my brother called the bank believing him rather than discussing the situation with me. DCF was called and when I realized what had happened I called my siblings and told them I quit and one of them was going to have to step in.  They were horrified. Take care of him? But he's so mean and difficult! So for the first time the family got together and made a plan to help me take care of him. But they weren't there for the day-to-day abuse. It just kept getting worse. It was my fault he was old. My fault he was fragile. My fault he was blind. He'd go into rages at me often because I wasn't helping him enough with his laptop. Can you imagine trying to teach someone how to work a laptop when they're blind? He couldn't even remember how to turn it on!!  I had promised him I would do everything in my power to allow him to age in place. In the end I realized that wasn't going to work even though we had contracted with two different agencies to make sure we had 24-hour coverage. One of the aides who was caught sleeping made a complaint to DCF. Kind of a CYA kind of incident.   He was difficult until the very end. Convinced I was stealing his money he kept asking for an attorney to cut me out of the will. After the DCF investigation he went to hospice to wait for a bed at the ALF I had selected for him last year.   In hindsight I should have listened to my therapist who advised me to let go of my relationship with my parents and my brother. But I had been trained to be a \"good daughter\".   Yes I'm getting my inheritance. However I'm going to have to use quite a bit of it to get counseling to overcome my PTSD and my bad feelings about myself because I don't mourn either of them.", "date": "2022-02-01 18:53:17", "user_name": "LilyBear", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/adult-children-abused-by-parents-who-are-now-elderly-467437.htm"},

Most of us are trying to navigate the CG system with not a lot of help...and we feel 'guilty' b/c our LO is getting older and more frail right in front of our eyes. Maybe we feel 'guilt' b/c we finally realize that we're never going to have the relationship with them we'd wanted. That we cannot make them 'happy'.   'Guilt' implies we did something that was a planned vengeful act in some way. We do the best we can...and sometimes we hit the ball out of the park and sometimes we strike out. Let's not focus solely on the strikes.   I'm at a stage in life with my MIL where I simply cannot be anywhere near her and avoid all social situations where she may be. She cannot keep her vile comments about me to herself. It's embarassing for me and for the extended family who don't 'get it'. I have a very controlled relationship with my own mother who doesn't really even acknowledge my existence. What did I do to deserve this?   Absolutely nothing.   At age 65 I'm so tired of trying to adapt MY behaviors to placate these 2 difficult women. And to not have any 'guilt' when they pass b/c a lifetime of trying to be the 'best' for them failed.

She is beginning with signs of dementia although she is still pretty self sufficient. She is the most negative person I have ever known. She has alienated my siblings and any friends that she had left.She is critical of everything and everyone. Today first thing this morning I get greeted with how much she hates my cat and wants to get rid of him because she didn\u2019t shut a cabinet door all the way and he pulled out paperwork she had in there. I reminded her that it was my house and my cat and she literally had a tantrum.Although she could do light housework she doesn\u2019t. She sits and watches tv all day.

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "Hi Anonymous1  I was beaten so badly that I have permanent physical scars. My NM claims that it is all in my head and that she has done nothing to be forgiven for. She now 'uses' her age to be extra cruel verbally and emotionally abusive and as an excuse for her behaviour.  I did have care &amp; love shown to me by my great-aunt. When my mother wasn't looking she would feed care for me and love hold me.  My NM does have dementia but can be 'normal' for all doctor community ageing worker visits and so on.  I was always on egg shells trying to please. As an adult I lived with 'the guilt' of being such a \"terrible child\" so that it was my fault that I was beaten abused and humiliated She does her 'act' all the time. She is so good at manipulation and threats that lawyer and doctor are afraid to sign any documentation. I can't get her any other more help without it.  I am expected to be her help. My 'golden-child' sister lives so far away and won't really help me.   I have found out that I am now getting very sick. I think is was the stress I have endured that has actually damaged my heart and body. . Whenever I try to explain to mom that I am too weak or too tired to talk for longer than 30 minutes. then her phone calls and retaliation; get more and more meaner.  She continues to expect me to be at her beckon call even though I have tried to explain that I am sick. Apparently cancer is my fault. It is was and will always be about her.   As children of abusive mothers it is hard to believe that there is real dementia and not just another excuse to abuse us.  I thought I had forgiven my mother many years ago.  Though I can never forget what she did to me and continues to do to me.   I am also a mother who has made many mistakes with my own children now 34 32 30.  Sadly you are so right... you do reap what you sew. I never hit/hurt burnt slashed them called them names belittled them criticized or took away hope or set them up for a fall. I did try to give them better life than I had... but.... it was not enough.   I know that \"you can't give what you don't have\".  I probably did not try hard enough to overcome my upbringing because my boys all have problems; with me and with the world.  After your parent dies you won't get the chance to offer forgiveness. By giving forgiveness you can get forgiveness from others.   I think that abusive narcissists will abandon anyone and everyone (including children siblings 'friends' and parents) if that person is no use to them.  In fact they might walk over and kick a small hungry child--- unless someone is watching.. then they make a HUGE deal out of giving them a dollar.  It is my belief that trying to forgive will at least show you that you have an inner strength that was not pulled out of you and trampled on. Forgiveness is not for the forgiven but for the forgiver.

The last I remember she was in an ALF but planning to move back home against your better judgment.   I have been using Brene\u2019 Browns latest book as a reference book recently. She discusses human emotions and shares her sources. Under grief she mentions different types of grief that we go through. Some not conventionally recognized as grief. That would be Disenfranchised Grief.  Situations that need grieving where there are no traditional mourning practices.  Also there are three types listed from The Center for Complicated Grief. Acute grief Integrated grief and Complicated grief.   Although the explanation of Complicated Grief from The Center for Complicated Grief is different from this I think all caregivers have a complicated grief.   Being \u201cthe last\u201d and feeling the full weight of that is certainly an occasion for grief. In your case from reading your posts over the years I wonder if you aren\u2019t also suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? You have been through a lot with your parents. We all have been through a lot in our lives and it is so good that you are honoring yourself with searching for support.  Perhaps your next therapist should be one with training in complicated grief work? Whether your mom has passed or not you have been grieving for a long time. Very understandable.   So after writing that about Brene\u2019 Brown I wondered what she would say about trauma. I did a google and came across a great podcast transcript of hers with Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Bruce Perry about their book \u201cWhat Happened To You? Conversations on Trauma Resilience and Healing\u201d. It might be helpful.   One last thing and perhaps not so heavy as my other suggestions is Ancestry.com When I started on ancestry years ago it was only for a few minutes at a time. My mom loved genealogy and I would look up things for her. After awhile I realized that I felt more connected to my family and that I wanted to know more. Reading the census records gave me a feeling of being with those great greats back in the day Sometimes I was shocked to see how long ago they lived as their stories were so relatable. Previous to this my eyes would roll back in my head when the genealogy subject came up. It was like reading the fine print of an insurance policy to me until I felt the connection.   Big hugs to you Upstream.

{"post_id": "472854", "title": "Need to vent\u2026", "body": "Hi Amy &amp; welcome to the forum!  I'm sorry you are going through this with your mother. Why did you move her in with you if I may ask? My mother has always been a very negative individual as well which made me decide to NEVER move her in with me decades ago. So when I had to move both parents near me in 2011 after dad had to stop driving I set them up in a senior apartment bldg in Independent Living. I still did a ton FOR them it was just not inside my home; they had their place and my DH &amp; I had ours. Then after dad fell &amp; broke his hip I had to get them both into Assisted Living in 2014; dad passed in 2015 and mom stayed on in the same AL. It was a good thing too b/c she was diagnosed with progressive dementia in 2016. She became even more negative &amp; miserable in general so I was VERY relieved that she was in AL and not living with me. We were able to maintain our relationship intact that way vs. me having a ton of resentment and hating my life in my own home as you are feeling now.  Mom is now 95 and living in Memory Care AL wheelchair bound and incontinent. She has WAY too many issues to live anywhere BUT in managed care so she's where she belongs and very well cared for by the staff and visited by myself &amp; my DH frequently. Her dementia has progressed to the point where she's delusional almost all of the time so she thinks she's living in a hotel and going out to different restaurants and entertainment centers on a daily basis so that keeps her happy thankfully.  You have to figure out how to get your mom into her OWN place now preferably in Assisted Living that also has a continuum of care so she can segue into Memory Care when the time comes. You tell her that you love her very much but that you need your house back it's not working out for EITHER one of you to be living together. Period. She'll rant &amp; rave but in the end you're doing this to save your own sanity. She is manipulative and trying to guilt you into feeling pity for her by eating too little etc and that will only lead to you feeling MORE resentment and having the relationship suffer irreparable damage as well. Save it while you still can that's my suggestion. Let the staff in AL take care of her and deal with her tantrums as well; you can go visit her and spend some quality time together instead of this 24/7 situation going on now. If she accuses you of 'throwing her to the curb like trash' so be it. She'll get over it once she acclimates to AL. If you wind up hating her by keeping her in your home who wins then? Neither one of you. You're better off having her angry NOW than having a horrible relationship for the rest of your lives.  Here is a useful article on dementia called Understanding The Dementia Experience by Jennifer Ghent-Fuller; it's a 33 page booklet which is a free download:  https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/210580  It will help you understand what is going on in HER head nowadays and how you can deal with her in a more useful manner.   Wishing you the best of luck dealing with a difficult situation. I hope you agree to take care of YOURSELF now as well as your mother b/c there are TWO lives here that matter!", "date": "2022-02-04 22:06:25", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/need-to-vent-472854.htm"},

I am 68 years old. Try as I might to let the things she does and says just roll off I can't. It feels like being tortured and put to death by a thousand pin pricks. She is narcissistic and manipulative. She never acknowledges that things she says can be hurtful to others - she says they are too sensitive. I have tried to express my feelings to her but have learned it does no good so I just clam up and stop talking to her. Sadly I don't enjoy her company so work at distancing myself from her mentally emotionally and spiritually. It feels like the only way to save myself but fear I may become an empty shell.  As a young girl I was not necesarily close to her - I now am getting a clearer picture of why.  You are not a selfish person. The feelings we have towards our mothers are not comfortable so I think we try to push them down because they make us feel guilty and selfish. I was once told that guilt is resentment turned inward. There may be some truth to that.  Do what you can to be true to yourself. Do what you can to have whatever relationship with your mother that works for you. One of my worries is that when mom is gone I will feel guilty for any unkind ways I treated her. I want to be able to look myself in the mirror and know I did the best I could in a very difficult situation.  Take care and know you are not alone. There are many of us in the same boat.

Sometimes I wish I would be the one to die because I have no real life of my own. It seems my self-worth is tied only to how well she is doing. She is healthy for her age and her family had many members who lived beyond 100 years old. So I know how my life will be next year and the next year and so on.  During the pandemic lockdown I got very involved in upgrading and decorating my home and yard as a do-it-yourself homemaker. My home is finally becoming more of what I dream of. I walk to try to stay healthy myself but I've gained a lot of weight. Not looking for a mate and can't put Mom on a diet so I've come to accept how fat I've become. I check out travel and cruise packages dream of going to Europe one day. By the time I am able to travel the pandemic should be under control and safe. So these are my dreams a nice home and far-away vacation.  I have learned that passion is for the young mostly because I don't have the strength or the ability to be passionate any longer. But I have also learned that with age comes some wisdom some contentment and some time to do the little things I ignored for years. These are the little things I have learned to pursue and I find myself more peaceful than I have ever been before. I guess I have finally come to accept that this is my life and it's okay. It's a life well lived. I hope this helps you at least to know there are others that understand how you feel. You are a good person. You are a good daughter.

All of the companies are screened. They have had a lot of success at both ends. It was on the \"Today\" Show.  It's sounds like you and hubby jumped in and did a remarkable job reversing everything. You should both be commended.  You are doing an absolutely fabulous job! Keep in mind years' ago someone once said to me \"You can let people rock your boat but don't let them tip you over in it\". I think you get my message.  You are trying to give I assume (your mother-in-law) dignity and quality of life. You also sound like you have \"order\" in your life. When you are caregiving you have to keep some people at bay. I am organized just like you neat on time people remarked how orderly and \"peaceful\" everything is. Peaceful I repeat. This doesn't happen on it's own. It's by keeping a routine schedule and being a good steward over what you do have (materials things living arrangement etc.)  Don't let other people's \"erratic\" behavior come into your castle. It's takes work it takes declining \"some not all\" invitations and you set the schedule for visitations with your mother-in-law. When they visit \"the troublemakers\" you give them a window for example Mom is at her best in the morning from 10AM-12 Noon. Tell them we have appointment to get to that gets them out the door.  I don't imagine this sibling ever shows up with a box of pastry or flowers and asks you \"do you need anything\"? You have to take control which you certainly have and limit contact with the sibling who will destroy everything you built.  I am the female version of Felix Unger so I have my quirky ways we all do. But I insist on keeping my small place with Mom a place of beauty. And some people seek out to destroy that. Don't be polite about this.    The one's that make the most noise usually do the least and usually get the most attention and resources in the family. Unfortunately oftentimes their situation never improves. We all have a relative or (2) who needs a little help now and then along the way and you pitch in and they get on their feet--a death divorce sickness job loss--life happens. But for other's it can be lifelong with no end or improvement of any kind in sight. I call it the kitten who lost their mittens. They always have a problem. Probably more than what you can provide. More like they need professional help-social worker retraining skills perhaps housing and food voucher. They need to be assessed but you can't do everything.   Stay centered.

My mother-in-law is 77.  For 8 years since my father-in-law passed my husband's sibling and adult children have taken advantage of her; stripped her financially destroyed her property stole whatever they could to support their addictions. They left their dogs for her to care for (11?) and the list goes on. Anyway the house was full of rodents roaches a large rat snake (not a pet) holes in the walls and floors falling through.   Mom did not want to leave her husband died here so my husband left his job moved to his mom's removed all the human rats and spent 2 years cleaning the property and getting ready for a new home be put on it for her.   My husband found homes for multiple dogs so now we are down to 4 outside and 2 inside) and the new home was put on the property. Now we are getting ready to remove the remaining debris.  However Mom's personal care got to be too much for hubby alone so I retired from my position - he picked up a local job and now I care for mom 24/7.   When I was working I bought mom all new clothes bedding towels drapes furniture appliances etc...so everything was ready for the new house.   To present....So far it has been pretty easy...I clean and do laundry in the AM. She gets up around noon then the rest of the day belongs to her. Typically every other day begins with giving her a shower doing her hair cleaning her bed and bath rooms cooking breakfast massaging her knees and feet and cleaning up incontinence issues as they occur throughout the day - which occassionally means multiple showers.  Her bedroom is cleaned regularly and her 2 little inside dogs (one is mostly house trained the other one poops and pees wherever she feels like it probably because she is a senior dog) - are cared for; fed and bathed.  Mom has since progressed wonderfully in many ways - health wise. Her skin and face looks fresh the arthritic swelling in her knees (which made wearing pants difficult for her) has significantly gone down and she is now able to move around her new home much easier.   Problem 1: One sibling. Everything is drama and most of the time this sibling needs money. - which mom always tries to give. Last year the child demanded a lot of money for a downpayment on a car...literally bullied her until it was received -- and it is like this most every month. Its always something leaving Mom upset and wanting to give whatever money is \"needed\" to this child.   When we explain there is no money to give the bullying gets worse mom gets stressed and anxious her memory lapses she gets confused angry and frustrated. She talks about selling everything going to a nursing home or just dying. It literally takes a couple of days to calm her down.   This sibling hasn't been over for 2 weeks now..mom is starting to flourish though she still calls this sibling everyday.   Problem 2. I will have start working again soon. I am applying for work-from-home positions. Though finding something legit is proving difficult.  So coping: I think I am doing okay.

Well that woman just so happens to be my Husband's biological mom. He moved in with her into the house he grew up in back in 2011. She just couldn't keep up with all the responsibilities of the property and at the time he was single so he was happy to help. Back then he could work a full time job and not worry about his mom being alone all day. Now fast forward 11 years and I am the one providing the care for his mom who cannot be left alone period! I married him he has 4 other siblings who do nothing but criticize and gossip about me when they are together yet they don't help with 87 yearold mom. The x son in law helps more than her own kids except my husband. I'm here with her all day while my husband is at work. And when his siblings practically scared and threatened me into the position claiming I never \"went upstairs to help\" considering that my husband's sister lived upstairs with her and I did go up there but the sister was not mentally stable what so ever and I couldn't be around her she would accuse me of stealing from her and she would get physically violent at times. Plus I did all the house work and made sure all the garbage on the property was up on the road every week and cleaned up the property plus I took care of my 14 yearold son and husband on top of cleaning after his sister and aging mom. So the truth is she financially took advantage of the situation did nothing to benefit anyone in the house made more messes and verbally abused her mom for what? To get a free ticket out of our house and get taken care of by sis telling the sis that my husband and I do nothing for his mom that I never go upstairs when she was the reason why I couldn't sometimes to up there.

He has dementia and had health issues and he lived with me for 4 months while i helped to get his health stable. I had to go part time from full time work in order to care for him. It was my intention to keep him with me but he has since had a leg amputation due to a diabetic foot wound. His dementia and his amputation together has made it impossible for me to care for him and run my business and care for my kids. I just can't be everywhere and do everything. My dad has always been a loner (not particularly family oriented) controlling critical and demanding. He went into a rehab facility that is about 20 min away from me after his amputation and I have decided to transition him to the nursing home side of the facility. He now calls and emails me constantly to come and get him out of there. He says he feels anxious when I'm not around and he wants home cooked meals and to stay at my house. At first I jumped at every call because I feel guilty not having him here. But I started to just get more resentful and exhausted and my kids and work had to take a backseat to his needs. I was visiting every weekend and/or bringing him to my house every weekend. But now I don't jump every time he calls and I go about every 2- weeks. I have constant guilt because I know it's not his fault that he has dementia and he feels frustrated to only have one leg. The guilt is always nagging away at me. But I do have to say that my life has simplified somewhat and I know that my dad is safe and well care for where he is. I think you have to think about YOU and your kids and your sanity! You can't continue to futilely try to please or appease her. You can call her now and then send a gift send flowers write her a personal note.

When my mom died I was left on my own and two years later I'm still struggling except at age 61 I get tired easier and carrying on with my own life is exceptionally difficult. Now I did manage to forge my own life but it has been HARD! I don't know your financial situation but you will be left totally alone and the bills will keep on coming. You need to try to forge your own life but the older you get the more difficult it will be. You will have to battle things like age discrimination. The sad truth is--unless you have plenty of money the older you get the less people will want you. If this sounds grim--it is. I'm not going to sugar coat we live in a very youth-oriented society. I look in the mirror and I really realized mom ate up my life caring for her but she also could not help having 15 years of Alzheimer's disease with insulin-dependent diabetes and the last 6 years of her life--required 24/7 even though for decades she needed supervision due to her many chronic diseases she managed to live 90 years 3 months and died with excellent skin. I never moved away from my mom. I never left my mom until she died. And I'm having to live on my own without her.   But some people live to be 100 and at age 93 she has a good chance of living more years. I would give my soul to Satan if I could have my mom back. She was my entire universe and I lost her forever...so enjoy having your mom while she lasts because when people die it is for all eternity. Never to be seen again. BUT just look at this sentence and see how SELFISH it is. With mom's multiple chronic diseases that would be cruel because mom died very very peacefully and never suffered and if she came back she would have to die all over again--life is in reality an ORDEAL and she's beyond that that nothing can ever hurt her. We face possible WW3 -- it is the living that represents suffering.   Right now you need to plan on her dying get pre-arranged funeral/cremation and estate planning so see an eldercare attorney. Trust me you will go through pure hell with a quagmire of paperwork and legal garbage -- DEATH IS EXPENSIVE and is pure business. If you depend on you mom financially you really will have a hard time because you have to get your ducks in a row and FIND A JOB FAST. At age 65...good luck with that.   MAKE SURE WHEN SHE DIES NOTHING GOES TO PROBATE.   While I suffer many fears in life..hey you only have one life to live...so live it -- but when she does die for the first time in my life I also have a chance to live. I also realize I got so used to being tied to my mom I could not cope outside of that and for the first time that cage has been opened. So it is my first breath of life on my own.

Anyway back to the exam room husband just started to rattle off stuff some sort of joke (I think-can't really remember it all so surprised-my brain just kind've froze) he laughed to himself he was kind've in his own world independent of myself or the doctor looking at the floor while he was talking. It only lasted a minute of two. I did not say a word this time just letting him be himself and I hope the doctor could see the changes. Later that day hubby and I had a real disagreement about his cognitive ability I did not tell him about some stuff I've changed over the past month or so as a direct result of his dementia. Which would have escalated easily to the unmanageable level argument with him. So the migraine (surprise) that was idly hanging out in the back of my head decided to make itsself known took some extra meds to manage it. So how am I doing? Stressed and walking the knife edge between sanity and dementia.", "date": "2022-02-02 23:21:29", "user_name": "Ariadnee", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/how-are-you-coping-187022.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},
{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "My 91 year old father moved in with my husband and I a little over two months ago. He fell at home (he lives 10 minutes away - we've always been a close family) and fractured his pelvis spent a few weeks in rehab. Our house is a two family and my sister lives upstairs (it's not a big two family - 2 beds downstairs and one up a bathroom on each floor). The facility specifically told us that my father could no longer live by himself. My sister works full-time and is single so she cannot care for him during the day. I've been working part-time off and on for years family has always been a priority so caregiving fell on my shoulders. Just seemed to make sense to move Dad into our house so he wouldn't be alone and I could still take care of the pets and everything else. We rented a van and moved our college aged daughter into my old bedroom at his house (she's away at school) and my father took her room at our house. My sister moved some of her things into his house in her old room and kept some of her things in her apartment upstairs (my father was very worried that someone would break into his house and didn't want it sitting empty - we figured one less thing for him to worry about). Basically everyone's life was uprooted. The first couple of weeks my father was literally awake all the time. The rehab facility changed his medication and added some new drugs that really did not agree with him. His doctor prescribed additional medication to help him sleep - it woke him up and made him more confused. It took a while to get his medications straightened out but we did. Showering was an issue - thankfully my husband volunteered for the job. Incontinence is an issue. He still gets the urge to use the bathroom but can't make it. So he wears adult diapers. Only problem is that he still thinks he has to run to the bathroom. So he was doing this at night and not putting the diaper back on properly or just not putting it back on at all. So there were many many night time accidents. And like a child he woke us up nightly screaming he was wet (him the bed everything needed to be changed all hours of the night). So I was constantly washing something - my dryer called it quits after two weeks (I completely understood - it was a lot of work).   He has physical and occupational therapy a few times a week at home along with a visiting nurse. The therapy helps a lot but feels like my home has a revolving door - always someone stopping by for something. My dogs are always barking at someone. The therapy has helped him immensely. My father is walking much better with a cane and has learned how to properly use the bathroom and potty chair in his room. The occupational therapist worked with him and he no longer wets the bed at night the way he was when he first moved in. Biggest problem right now is his constant craving for attention and severe memory loss. If he wakes up at 3 in the morning he thinks we're all ignoring him (we're sleeping). I keep reminding myself that it's all new for all of us him included. It's not easy and I don't know what the future holds.Some days are good and some days are tough.

{"post_id": "468968", "title": "Has anyone just lost the \"lust for life\"?", "body": "I can understand. I\u2019m an only child in a similar situation. The important thing is to not abandon yourself your passions and your own life-identity. As only children it\u2019s too easy to get enmeshed with our parents it comes with the territory of having no other immediate family so I get it. But please take my advice and always carve out time for you even if it means waking up early to do exercises or read a novel just for fun. Also take time out for socials! Look up meetup in your area and find ways to meet new people and don\u2019t rule out romance you may meet someone nice. Don\u2019t allow age to get you down it\u2019s never too late to start over and set goals. If you can afford it hire a nurse to stay with your mom for a few hours each week just do you can do whatever you want. It seems that most of your life you\u2019ve been giving and doing practical stuff and all this seriousness can really take away a lust for life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m encouraging you to ditch the \u201cshoulds\u201d and give yourself this time to just be silly and hedonistic you need and deserve it otherwise you will burn out. If it\u2019s not possible to leave home then get creative with how you can entertain at home\u2014arrange a part of your home so that one side is your \u201capartment\u201d or cave and maybe organize your own meetup there. What are your hobbies? Do you have any dreams goals or aspirations that you had to put on hold because of caretaking? Can you revisit them? Be flexible. A dream may have to change its form to suit your current situation but let the passion ignite your fire. Play music! Create playlists on your smartphone or just go old school and play CDs and records (which are cool again). Get out your favourite clothes and just wear them around the house! Yes that evening gown or cocktail dress counts. Just wear them on a Monday to the grocery the post office. Make everyone including yourself believe that you\u2019re going somewhere! And you are. Fashion along with makeup abs hairstyling can literally wake up your soul and get you going. Eat your favorite food. Cook all your favorite dishes and get out your crystal silverware and celebrate life with mom. Don\u2019t wait for a special occasion the fact that you\u2019re together is something to celebrate. Use the internet to get ideas. The public library too is a great place to create a book club knitting club. The reference librarian can assist you with finding resources. I understand how easy it is to get isolated especially during this time but if you can use the time at home to talk more to neighbors and local businesses this will bring cheer to your day. After caretaking my mom and now my dad I had to learn how to bring my art sketchbooks and writing journals with me to the hospital. This daily habit of just sneaking in creative time lead to published stories and exhibitions. I encourage you to steal whatever time you can for yourself. Julia Cameron\u2019s excellent book \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Way\u201d can help you to re-discover your passions and dreams with practical daily prompts and exercises. Also use the power of the digital age to help you exercise. If you can\u2019t commit to going to the gym or classes you tube workouts are great.  good luck and please invest in yourself you gave your whole life ahead of you and your parents will want you to enjoy it.", "date": "2021-08-01 08:53:12", "user_name": "LeahO71", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/has-anyone-just-lost-the-lust-for-life-468968.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

You are not alone--put the guilt in a package place it on a boat and sail it down a river--say good-bye and fill your life with goodness and grace--don't allow her to cause further harm to you and your children. Step away and take a break--she will be fine without you--she can do so much harm to your physical and mental health--protect your life and your health.

How the shudda woudda coulda- all rises to the top more damage done than even I expected- and I knew I was a friggin train wreck!   Shortly after she passed my husband took a stroke- vascular dementia- and I am struggling to be the best I can be for him; somedays I just cant take the drooling garbled words and I feel awful saying thing like-\" I missed that try again\" Im trying to maintain his dignity treat him as a respected husband still love him discuss things as husbands and wives do..... Im loosing it.  Sometimes I wonder if the mom issues just knocked the stuffin's out of me and I have less to work with for him like tolerance-the drooling sends me out of my mind. I know better and I cant seem to work past it.   Ok so those are todays issues but for you that are still dealing with mom or dad....please dont wait til their death put an end to this. If you carried what I carried Im suggesting you start now- the healing process- have something left over either for you or whatever else get brought your way.  She used to refer to me as the \"Blood clot that learned to walk and talk\". Or\" the worst miscarriage she ever had-she survived\". All those little terms of hers are silent now but not in my head. Still can hear them still remember when and where she would toss out those phrases.....and on days Im sinking caring for my husband.....here they come again..... Dont wait for the parents to pass-dont let their labels become who you are as I did. Cuz in my situation now granted Im not called a little b**** stupid b**** Gods garbage 24/7 like before yet when I cant seem to help my husband all that is loud and clear.   I will say this for the first time publicly-here and now- I am 64 yrs old and I have no true sense of who I am. Nothing. I live from sun up to sun down nothing in between. Im realizing now how over the years and demands became constant coudnt tell you the last movie I went to last time I danced used to decorate for holidays bake crochet curled my hair or put on make up- my nails are now short and unpolished refinished a piece of furniture....its all gone. As the years got worse I dropped pieces of me all over the roads traveled and today....there is nothing left to give up. Covid took the job-stroke took my husband; both I loved A LOT!

My parents moved in with me back in 2019; my dad had Parkinson's &amp; mom was worn out from caregiving for him. He was a piece of work; used to being independent and being the boss but with the PD the filter that used to keep him at least nominally interested in other people disappeared. He passed away after a hospitalization in 2020 - probably a PE but a blessing/release in any case.   So now it's just mom living with me. I bought a house for them to move in with me because my condo would not have worked (stairs). Overextended myself on it but it's done. All of their stuff is in the main part of the house; I have my own room/bathroom but just about everything else is hers. My stuff is in the basement as is the rest of hers because when we moved God forbid we got rid of too much. Dishes pots/pans etc. that never get used but have to be unpacked &amp; put on shelves... (\uff0d\u2038\u10da).   I ended up spreading my own furniture out to occupy the space I needed to avoid having her ideas take over the basement too. My dad didn't leave her with much financially and what she had left after their house sold is almost gone because she just buys things we don't need. Retail therapy.   She's had a cough for 4 months now - her dr is treating the symptoms which is about all he can do since the likely reason for it is she eats too much of the wrong things (wheat dairy etc.). I think she has an eating disorder - she used to be quite heavy but had gastric bypass followed by several other complications. She has plenty of energy to shop or cook all over the kitchen but gets exhausted if she has to do anything she doesn't want to do.   I get that some of this is probably backlash from being my dad's caregiver herself for so many years; he wasn't a kind man before PD &amp; she's a retired nurse so there was a lot she did that probably most wouldn't have done. But sure as she feels the least bit neglected she gets \"sick\" which then becomes an actual sickness requiring attention &amp; reassurance.   I have no friends that aren't also now her friends because she's competitive about it - had to go meet my co-workers so now I don't even have that. We go to church when she's up to it - which she hasn't been for weeks because she's self-conscious about the coughing. Yes she has asthma but again cutting out the wheat and dairy help that too - can't cut that out though because that's what she eats: sandwiches with meat and cheese...   I've been working from home for the last almost 2 weeks because we caught whatever bug is floating around; she got dehydrated and dizzy/unsteady. She's better today (drinking more water) &amp; I'm looking forward to going back to the office but then what? She sits at home &amp; waits for me to come home instead of making new friends or contacting the ones she has. I'm not her husband - I'm her daughter....   She won't take care of herself because she knows that I will - sister moved out of the country to not have to deal with this. 2 brothers live in different states - bless them they both have had her stay with them for a week here &amp; there but now mom is not comfortable flying by herself &amp; wants me to go with her. Doesn't get that part of these trips is giving me a break &amp; God forbid anyone should actually say that - she'd go into a funk &amp; throw it up in my face for the rest of her life. NH is not an option at all. Couldn't do it.   She has no hobbies &amp; doesn't want any friends that aren't associated with the church. More &amp; more dependent &amp; enmeshed as the days go by &amp; I'm the bad rotten terrible person who can't say anything because other people do not get it. I love my mom - I really do! - and I was so glad that they moved here instead of being 750 miles away but she's overly dependent &amp; needy &amp; it's getting harder to handle. So one day at a time. I can do this for today.

I am also the one in the family that tends to feel guilt over things which I have no control - I think that was the influence of my mother's mom with whom I was very close as a child but hooboy did she ever enjoy laying on the guilt. She was really a professional at it.  To my mom's credit she never ever took advantage of me even knowing I felt all of those things that I listed. She was also not physically difficult to take care of; she didn't have any sort of dementia so mentally she was always my mom. It was the CHF that left her so weak that she needed help with some ADL's; others she was able to handle with no problem.   I don't know honestly how I would have done if the time had come that I had to place her. While taking care of her at home was incredibly hard in an emotional and mental sense I am grateful that her health never got so bad that we had to make a hard choice about placement.

He discovered that the metal levels in his blood leached from his new hip implant were causing these neurological symptoms. After revision surgery his metal levels dropped and his symptoms disappeared.Since then Dr. Tower has done his own studies on the potential for neurological problems associated with increased cobalt levels caused by metal artificial hips.If you develop symptoms after implanting a medical device (apparently many are allowed into the market without adequate testing\u2026 the horror!) such as an artificial hip please look into whether there are any toxic levels (for example metal) in your blood to eliminate this as a possible cause.Hope this is helpful!

If we did it out of reciprocal love and care this wouldn't be an issue.  I think many of us do it because we love our parents regardless of what kind of parent they were or are. Which can be the same or two entirely different people.  I agree with JoAnn that an abused child should not be a hands on caregiver. Making sure they are getting the care they need is the only way to not stay triggered all the time especially if they haven't changed. I think it is also a dangerous situation for elder abuse to occur particularly when the parent treats the adult as a child that is under their authority and needs to be submissive.  For me I help because they need(ed) it and I am the only one willing.   If I treated them the way they treated me that's means I am no different than them and have no room to talk or be hurt by their actions. I also believe that vengeance is not mine. I am only answerable for my actions not theirs.  Good boundaries are vital when we decide to help our elder parents or anybody for that matter.

My mother was mentally ill while I was growing up and I suffered greatly at her hands whether she was intentionally abusive or not. My father was pretty much not around b/c he was working to support her me and her mother who lived with us contributing greatly to the enormous chaos in the home. So no my childhood was anything but warm &amp; cozy. But I'm the only child so who else could step up and take over the care and management of my parents if not me?  'Blood ties' have nothing to do with it in my case b/c these are not my biological parents but my adoptive ones.  Personal integrity has a lot to do with who steps up to care for their parents in their old age too regardless of how they were or were not raised I believe. We have to overlook many things in order to do what's necessary for them as they age get sick need help medical attention doctors living arrangements etc. etc.   So again at the root of 'why' is Love in my opinion. Nothing else really matters at the end of the day. If I love you I will do whatever I have to do to make sure you are properly cared for safe and as happy as possible.

This is because the child was \"raised to be\" what they are--afraid of the parent obligated to the parent starved for the parent's approval. I had just about the best parents in the world. They raised me to be independent to know that the world would require that of me to go out on my own and make my own life and family to care for THEM in the best way I was able. They made themselves safe and comfortable by moving into a village in which care could progress for them as needed allowing them first a duplex then into apartment then onto different levels of care when needed. They saved all their lives so as not to be dependent on their children. They taught US my brother and me how to save. It is the eagle story you know. The eagle's nest is on an island and there is a terrible storm and the eagle must try to save it's eaglets as the waters rise. First the father takes one eaglet across the raging waters. During the flight he asks the babe \"And when I am old and tired will you save me alike\" and the chick replies \"Oh yes father; I WILL\" and this eaglet the father bird drops at once into the raging waters where it quickly perishes. The father goes then for the next and last babe and while crossing asks the same question of it. The baby answers \"Oh father I am so sorry; I cannot promise you this. But I promise you I will carry your lesson for life and I will do all I can to save my OWN babies\". This chick was carried to safety. The way of it is that our parents have children whether by choice happenstance. They do all they can for them given their limitations. And the children should pay this forward. Sadly it is not always how it works and we daily see families destroying themselves and their own children for parents who spent their lives as abusive to those same children.", "date": "2022-02-07 11:31:18", "user_name": "AlvaDeer", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/correlation-between-what-elderly-parent-has-done-for-you-and-what-you-now-do-for-them-472899.htm"},

Maybe its the word 'owe' that is the problem. I do believe that no child abused by a parent should physically care for that parent. I don't think we should give up jobs and our homes to care for them. Bringing them into our homes is not always a good thing either.   Once we leave our parents home we really can't go back. (I had to and 1 year was enough) We change. We grow and mature. We have different experiences than our parents. Our views are no longer the same. We are now adults with jobs homes and our own families. But as we age so do our parents. They need to rely on someone and it should be their children. And as children we should at least make sure they are safe and cared for. Help find them resources. Set them up in a care facility. You can then walk away.   In a perfect world the child graduates from high school and maybe college. At that point the child starts a life of their own. Marries at that point that family becomes #1. Once the nest is empty the parent should be finding things that interest them get involved. New stage in their life. Neither child or parent should need to rely on each other. But that's not the real world. We have children who rely on parents to live and visa versa. Both spending money they don't have. Drugs and alcohol go both ways.   Its a shame that there is abuse in families and those who did the abusing then expect that child to care for them in their old age. And its a shame that that child feels obligated. In that situation a child needs to know its OK to walk away. We all need to set BOUNDRIES. What we can do and what we can't do. And it would be nice if our parents excepted this and did what needed to be done to be safe and cared for. Can't keep your house up then you downsize. Need 24/7 care then you go to an AL or LTC. You don't ask ur children to give up their lives so you can continue to live in a dream world. Its not being independent when you expect a child to do all the work and sacrifice so you can stay put. We stop needing to use the phrase \"We want Mom/Dad to stay in their home as long as possible\".

The area also was anchored by a farmhouse way back in the 1950s or so and as my father explained sometimes debris was buried at the back of the farm areas.   I found a lot of old little bottles and chunks of concrete which I suspect were left over after paving the driveway and sidewalk. So they got added as border to the fern and wildflower garden.

{"post_id": "426496", "title": "Caregiver's cats behaving badly.", "body": "Thank you Send. It was truly more about getting a cat (or a couple of them) out of bro's environment after I saw what the deal was there. He has a very small house and lot and five cats seemed too many for him to care for long-term. Bro said at lunch \"You want a cat?\" and invited me over to meet the cats/Simon. For everyone's sake I would have brought him to my place. And after the first moment of chaos in my home which I figured would happen (but I didn't say that part to bro) he would be taken to a great cat shelter here where kind souls could determine if he's ready for a new home. Simon would probably do best in a one-cat household.   I told my bro this -- that I would \"try\" him and then if it didn't work out I would take him to a well-reputed shelter. I think that's why bro went back on this the next day because he thought I was going to take him to a shelter. He read me right. I had no plans of keeping another cat long term but I was open to it if Lilah and Simon got along.   They seemed like mostly nice cats. Simon reminded me of Divo -- the way he came right up to me for rubs and was sassy to other cats. They all looked clean and healthy and tipped ears indicated they're fixed. Simon didn't hiss/scream at or connect with the other cats just ran them out of his immediate area when they came up. He has a 'tude. lol   He didn't seem like a mean cat that would attack others (my previous roommate's little nightmare was one of those cats and showed it RIGHT away) but was more puffing and flexing on Simon's part... ruler of the roost... big cuddly guy who wants to be the boss. Lilah is mostly shy/sedate and Divo and her clicked in their opposite personalities. I thought I'd try it out based on Lilah's history of being a bonded pair with a similar personality.  But yes. It was to help others and not what I wanted to do.   It was an interesting day. I sat there wrestling with my own feelings of not wanting this responsibility as I petted the cats but I had my way out planned in my mind and figured it would be best for the cats and bro.  *Lilah was feral as a kitten. I don't know how old she was when re-homed. She's been a great pet; an ideal indoor cat because she's always so calm and easy going.

I have a lot of designs that I've worked out but one that I still think of was a border around the 4 beds holding them together and filled with different colors of Alyssum twined in what would also be my Ode to Math bed: intertwined sines and cosines.

{"post_id": "187150", "title": "Gardening as therapy.", "body": "I\u2019ve been clearing the overgrown garden at my mother\u2019s supported living place for the past 6 months as they had real problems getting a gardener due to the pandemic (and Brexit - many of the workers had gone home to mainland Europe). I started this as a not entirely selfless exercise: I love gardening and it was something to do during visits to my mother which have always been a bit strained (but that\u2019s another story) and to keep getting outside through the winter months. It\u2019s been a bit like uncovering buried treasure. There were so many lovely shrubs and flowers just needing a bit of care. People have obviously planted things over the years for their elderly relatives and so it\u2019s a garden full of love. The early spring bulbs are now in flower and everything looks lovely. The real and unexpected bonus for me though is the joy it\u2019s brought to the residents. Some of them were once keen gardeners who are now unable to get stuck in but who still enjoy a walk round the garden to see what\u2019s in bloom. Others are a bit low after the winter covid and all the other world problems at the moment and have timidly stepped outside caught up by the enthusiasm of the others. One lady has a severe anxiety disorder but I have seen her looking at the spring daffodils with a smile on her face.

Wednesday evening he began to decline until his last breath Thursday evening.He was so good to me and others. I was chilled Wednesday night and bless his heart he tried to get me warm by laying blanket upon blanket on me. By the time I got out of all the cover we laughed. I wasn't cold any more. I still have to isolate as I have neutropenia fever. His memorial service is scheduled for Saturday a week.I am trusting my doctors will give me an okay to go. The church will have me by a door that only I will go in and out and the door will remain cracked for me to access fresh air everyone wearing masks (for my protection) and an 8' perimeter will be set up. I can't imagine not going and after 8 days of antibiotics I feel protected.This disease brought us closer to each other. His prayer was for us to leave this world together. I laughed and said \"I will order an elevator and when God sends it down we will both get on and ride.\"While so many family and friends did not understand dementia I am glad so many reading this does.

As I was aware they also told me she may not fit in due to being higher functioning. Her functionally is more akin to AL but the wandering and hampered memory which foster a certain amount of dependence pose an issue. The AL places I spoke with are not entire closed off facilities and the names I got would be out of my price range even if I was working and dedicated my entire salary. I also spoke to a couple of smaller end homes and their prices do make them slightly outside my reachSpoke with her PCP Doctor they are in favor of placement but would like her to have a one-to-one for companionship sake to avoid her bouts of anxiety.  I will be seeking a geriatric psych to explore medication options or how viable it would be considering the situation. Her behavior at home is manageable but the looking for people not respecting boundaries will be an issue in placement.I have explored some apartment options and looked into how to go about getting split shift aids covered through NY Medicaid I have an intake in March for that evaluation.

I fight so long then I quit when I am not getting anywhere.  You have no idea why brother is all of a sudden acting this way and he doesn't seem to be forthcoming. I do think he should have talked things over with you since he was now expecting you to take over the cost of Dads care. Maybe dear wife is putting pressure on him. Whatever your brother has handled this all wrong and for now you are not going to get thru to him. So time to back off. Let things settle down. Don't stir the pot. If brother calls screaming and hollaring tell him calmly you are willing to talk when you can talk to each other as mature adults then hang up. You have told Dad what is going on leave it at that.   Dad is going to need to make changes in his life. Brother is no longer willing to pay for his care. You can not afford to pay for his care. Dad cannot care for himself. People on this forum are in that same boat. If we were rich we wouldn't be on the forum. We could afford to put Mom/Dad in a nice place. So you let brother do what Dad assigned him to do. Dad is going to need to go to an AL or even a NH depending on the money Dad has available. Is Dad really in the position to fight?   Do you have a better solution? Can you move in with Dad and do his caring? Thats OK if you can't so then you let brother make all the decisions. Actually if Dad is competent than its between him and brother his POA. Brother has to tell Dad he is no longer willing to foot the bill for Dads care. Because of that other arrangements have to be made. Seems to be Dad will have no choice but to go into a facility. Maybe thats brothers problem. He has no idea how to approach Dad and his option was you. He is mad over a situation he doesn't know how to handle. And again maybe pressure from wifey.

As you will know from your last thread opinions here vary. Always pick up what works best for you and leave the rest. And speaking of varying some here love the companies that are modeling on \"A Place for Mom\" and some hate them. The truth is I like them and they have worked well for those I know. BUT they will hassle you once you sign up and you DO have to give them personal information such as the assets of the senior (which some prefer not to divulge.) Once they gather information on the senior they take you to facilities they think a match. For an instance my brother's ex wanders. He has alcoholic encephalopathy and he will leave to buy spirits and is not safe out on the streets. He has a place now which is assisted living with separate cottage and which is still a locked cottage to prevent wandering. PERFECT and he loves it and says he's their favorite! So it worked for him. Now should you use one and then decide it is not for you (they are paid by the facilities in the area when the senior is placed) then just resign and when they call say \"I lied; she's on medicaid\". You will never hear from them again. OP do know that there was nothing against you in your first thread getting locked. More about us.

{"post_id": "472965", "title": "Update: Towards my mothers situation.", "body": "I don't think I responded to your original post because I had seen certain people that I respect their opinions reply so I didn't.   Wandering is a Dementia thing. The one reason I placed my Mom in an AL was because at my house being a split level she was pretty much stuck in the room in the lower level. (She could not do stairs and I had 3 sets) The AL was like a square. The hallway went around inside the building with rooms on both sides. There were comfy chairs and couches book cases with books u could borrow. My Mom walked those halls a lot. Always coming back to the common area and dining/activity room. The AL had an outside area with a Gazebo and benches all around that was enclosed.  I think the care of a Dementia patient is beyond the care of a PCP. A PCP suggesting one on one care is not considering the cost to Mom. Because you should not be paying for that cost. My Mom was also in LTC. By that time she was wheelchair bound but could scoot around in that wc. The residents were allowed to wander the building. They are not confined. They would find one resident sleeping on another residents bed in another wing and walk her back to her wing. If Mom wanders at night there are sleep medications. There is also a night shift to keep an eye on her.   In my State ALs and MCs are private pay. Medicaid only gets involved when the resident has privately paid for at least 2 years. I was lucky 5 yrs ago to get Mom into an AL when they had a half price sale. It kept her cost just below 5k. Money ran out before 2 yrs so she was transferred to LTC with Medicaid paying. (Mom did pay 2 months privately) I see u have an appt with your State Medicaid. Be aware that their \"in home\" care may not pay for 24/7 care. Some States will only give a few hours. Can u be paid to be her caregiver or do they supply aides or do u go thru an agency that excepts Medicaid.  My daughter is an RN who worked in NHs with Dementia patients for 20 yrs. She was with me when we transferred Mom to LTC. After Mom was settled in my daughter said she thought I should have placed her earlier. No it wasn't perfect because Mom will never be cared for the way you would have cared for her. But my Mom was clean and cared for. On the whole the residents looked happy. I would visit and a staff member would be sitting talking to Mom. Others would tell me they had nice conversations with her. Mom was in her final stages.   So glad that you have made a geriatric psychiatric appt. Tests will now be done to determine where Mom is in her journey. What type of facility would most suit her. Kniwingcwhat type ofcDementia she has is important because of Medications.  Seems you are on the right track. Its just a matter of getting all the info you need to make informed decisions.

She likes to be out and about which is not an issue where we are because everyone knows her and she also knows the area very well. She is still operating on her long term memory at this point. The wandering more so will be an issue in places she is unfamiliar with.   They are willing to do an assessment but they told me not to hold my breath based off the conversation we had. I already knew AL was a long shot especially with me being honest with them going based off her worse day not the best. If I went based off her best then it would not be such an issue I think but that is unfair to the staff of the facilities rather be transparent with those involved in her care.   Like I exampled to them she is one of those residents that is easy to please just time consuming. I understand they are for 24/7 care but not a one-to-one companion service. That is more so where my mother is at she gets lonely and bored very easily unless she has some vested interest in the task and all parties are involved. Redirection is requires a more active approach since she still has some retention.   She is EO in terms of raw functional behavior but memory is more so at the Mid to serve stage. As her doctor has put it to me many times she is able to function based around her long deep seeded routine. We have explored medication in the past her current doctor has been against it. They are more in favor of non medication interventions. She has also been my mothers doctor since I was a kid. My mom still remembers them and trusts them.

With today's culture it's not hard to get folks to part with their money and old-fashioned saving is covertly discouraged.

My Dad is 74 and recovering from a ski accident/broken neck in a Rehab hospital. I've talked to two Social/Case Workers.

Initially I can see saying 'yes of course' he can live with me because by all means I want to help and 'make it better' or I will move in with him etc. Which gets the institutions off the hook.

Basically someone has to step to the plate and assure the hospital/facility of a safe discharge. The PCP can write a script for VNA services. In my case I asked the doc to send in the troupes. By that I mean physical therapist occupational therapist nurse home blood draw etc. Whatever your dad's coverage offers.   I found the aluminum gray walkers given out upon discharge make the patient all hunched over eyes to the ground poor posture and breathing as well as sore wrists after a while. One the crutches etc. are put away I would check with p/t about an UpWalker Lite or something similar. You can check out Amazon but have a paper trail (scrip from the PCP) so insurance will cover this.  Everything needs to be modified (the dwelling) before discharge. Your dad is probably going to want a \"male\" wash him a CNA. A shower chair commode all of this is covered under the health insurance you must have a scrip so everything will be covered.  A hospital bed chosen by the p/t or PCP may be needed. Again should be covered by insurance--you need a paper trail. Make sure you have help in hand and that if for some reason brother doesn't keep his word (like in my case) you're not stuck without help. This does happen.

{"post_id": "473350", "title": "What I Learned While I Sat With My Dying Mother For A Week In Memory Care/Assisted Living.", "body": "I sat with my mother in her Memory Care Assisted Living apartment for a week while she took her end-of-life journey recently and I learned an awful lot I wasn't aware of. My DH &amp; I visited her twice a week the past 6 months and at least once a week prior to that so we had contact with the staff the facility saw her apartment the grounds knew what was going on for the most part it's safe to say. What we did not realize was the quality of care she was getting or how happy she was in general. To hear mom tell it she was sad &amp; lonely miserable &amp; praying to God to let her die. That's the message she saved for me and for her niece in New York which made us feel terrible when she'd ask us to 'pray for me to die' or accuse us of not praying 'hard enough' because she was still alive. I lived with a constant low-level of guilt &amp; a feeling of not being a good enough daughter due to mom's chronic complaining about everything from the food to the weather to the lack of activities in the MC. No matter that I (nor anyone else) could NEVER reach her on the phone for her being busy in the activities room.What I learned while sitting with her for many hours each day for an entire week was that the caregivers went out of their way to shower mom with love &amp; affection &amp; attention. They came into her room every 20 minutes to see what she needed; to kiss her forehead &amp; tell her they loved her. Some stayed AFTER their shift ended to sit with her! They'd pull up a chair and sit next to her bed hold her hand and recount stories of the time they'd spent together. There was a constant stream of CGs &amp; other staff in and out of her room for an entire week. When going through her things I found dozens and dozens of handwritten cards from former caregivers that had quit and moved away; they wrote mom cards to let her know how they were doing! Or if they'd gotten married or had a baby! To let her know they were thinking of her and missed her. One gal named Angelica told me she was honored to know mom at the end of mom's life and at the beginning of HER life b/c she would carry her memory with her for life. The testimonies I heard were mind boggling.As it turned out mom was always positive upbeat smiling &amp; happy as a resident in Memory Care (and in AL before that). She was the cheerleader for all the residents! Always the first in line for the activities and to encourage the others to join in! Who knew? Not I that's for sure.This was the woman who made my life so difficult on every level for 64 years. Led me to believe she was so unhappy and sad in Memory Care in spite of me KNOWING she was well cared for fat &amp; happy. I could never get her to admit it  not even once in the nearly 3 years she lived there. I did everything humanly possible for the woman to make her life as comfortable as possible and I succeeded I just didn't KNOW it until I witnessed the testimony from the staff during the last week of mom's life.And I got a call from the Assistant ED the other day telling me that the trail of emails that went back &amp; forth after the staff was notified of mom's passing was THE most incredible thing she'd ever witnessed. The communication between the Assisted Living bldg and the Memory Care bldg was huge all the caregivers &amp; nurses expressing their sadness at her passing and offering condolences.For those who feel 'guilt' at having their loved on in residential care just take heed. Things aren't always what they appear to be.Rest in peace mom.

That's good and sometimes we need/deserve it. But sometimes we need to take responsibility for our own stuff I think.

{"post_id": "473093", "title": "Expectations of the \"institutions.\" The first question I was asked is if my dad can live with me.", "body": "They asked you the question. You have an aging Dad. Had you really never before thought of whether or not you could care for an elder in your home? If not then the time is here now.  So tomorrow bright and early you call the Nurse Manager and the Social Worker in charge of Dad's care. You tell her this:  \"Gee I am so sorry but I had never considered caring for my Dad in my home and on a phone call I got it kind of sprung on me and I answered yes. Now I need to tell you there are utterly NO CIRCUMSTANCES under which I could care for my Dad in his home. So now we need to get together on placing Dad for his own safety into in= facility rehab and then assess as we go as to whether Dad can go back home or must go to Assisted Living or some other level of care; I depend upon you to find the best placement you can during this discharge planning period. Sorry I misled you; Dad was always so vital and off skiing and I just never thought about this before.\" You can see it will do not good to tell US you can't do this. I couldn't either; not for a single second. You must tell THEM so they can begin planning for his rehab and deciding what level of care he needs. Now as to his care. Whatever insurance then assets your Dad has will go to pay his expenses for his care until those assets are gone. If he has a wife there will need to be division of their assets so that Dad will have his own portion to spend without robbing all of MOM'S money. If Dad owns a home the home will not have to be sold for his care unless that's how he wishes to do it (or his POA if he has dementia and has a POA). There will be \"clawback\" by the government to pay for Dad's care after his death should he need now to enter care ( when/if the home is sold.) That is to say the home will have a lien on it. Other than that the POA or the state if they have guardianship will apply for medicaid. The taxpayer will pay. Yes. That is what the taxpayer picks up the care costs for those who have run out of their own savings. As to what we pay taxes for???? I was an RN all my life and made quite good money and was proud and happy to pay my taxes. When I retired early at age 62 I began to collect Social Security. I am now 80. While I paid a whole lot of taxes guess what the Government in these last many many years has repaid me all of that and MORE. So figure it out. I am now using YOUR tax money as well.  My Dad has a saying about taxes and insurance. It was \"Let me pay a whole lot of taxes and let me get a whole lot of insurance and let me hope someone ELSE needs it and I stay healthy and without any monitary help for my needs\". I feel the same. I doubt they called you to DUMP (as you say) Dad. I think more they wanted to sincerely know if you were that rare one with the courage to attempt to take on elder care with in home rehab with the WISH to do so.  You aren't.  That's just fine. Either am I. I loved nursing but doing it 24/7? Nope. So on you go now. Get in touch with Social Worker and Nurse Manager and Discharge Planner and lay down the law as to what you will not do. They will ask you who is POA and who is familiar with Dad's finances if he cannot discuss that himself so they can get him the very best care his money can buy. Do know that he will have at least 20 days of rehab at medicare cost to get his ADLs and mobility going. Time will tell. I wish you the best and your Dad as well. Hope he recovers well and is soon back on his feet. Sounds like he was real active if this was a ski accident. A month of rehab and he may be right back at his near normal level.

It's probably one of her beloved late sister's she's been talking about incessantly for months now. :)We are scheduled to leave for AZ next Friday for my DH to have a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. We can postpone the trip if necessary by about a week or so. I don't feel like my mother is going to last too much longer in this condition though but only God knows her future.Please keep us in your prayers if you are so inclined as this is a particularly difficult time with mom's transition and an impending liver transplant coming up. I fluctuate between feeling relieved that her pain &amp; suffering is coming to an end and incredibly sad at the same time for having to bury my mother. I'm sure you can relate to that mixed bag of emotions.Thanks in advance to all who read this and send their prayers/good vibes/well wishes.

I'm still not able to go a day without crying. She lived with us for 10 years my kids are at college and my husband still works outside of the home. I work at home and the hardest part is the quiet. Her O2 machine was running constantly for the past year and turning that off after she passed... the quiet. And now during the day when I would normally check on her and get her something to eat after finishing a conference call...the quiet and the loneliness.She was mentally strong but her COPD and heart issues took their toll. For a good while she always got up every day dressed read books got on FB even baked for us sometimes. Then the past couple of months I saw her slowing down..until within the last couple of weeks she started sleeping didn't have much interest in getting on her iPad to read or do FB. But she still got up and came to the family room until her very last day. I feel I was in denial that it was actually happening and then happening so fast. I feel I wasted time I could have taken off work to spend with her in those final weeks. I know she was comforted to be here with her family she watched my kids grow up she was loved. But this regret the guilt the would have should have could have... these thoughts still make me sad and then I cry.I'll try to keep checking in here and sharing thoughts.

We will be living with corona forever I do believe and with its variations which will continue with so many not vacced. It is up to each one of us whether or not we want protection. We are ALL likely to get it. The real question is whether we will die of it or not. We are all going to have to make our own choices.  No government in the world can force this issue on a populace unwilling; so we will continue to lose a lot of people.  We are overpopulated so there is that.  I currently have completely relaxed into knowing at 80 I will now be masked in public places transit and etc. for the rest of my life; I will vacc and make my own decisions about where I go and let others worry for themselves.

Leave it to each individual and his or her MD is my way from now on.  As a retired RN I know nurses still working (and even one hospital administrator who is a friend); they are all exhausted if rich (lots of overtime). They are losing the ones without any vaccination. They are trying hard for each patient they have but no longer have patience and/or time for explanations with families. It is sad to see.

A few nights later my other neighbor was kept awake by incessant coughing and hacking from next door. The next day he went to that neighbor's house and asked for a ride to the hospital.  No one was allowed to visit after that. The hospital only has that rule around Covid.  I can't say how much caregiver stress had to do with his demise but I didn't observe the masked desperation or isolation I've seen in so many caregivers. This was a social guy who'd ride his bike ran a doggy daycare in retirement and organizes neighborhood golf outings.  SO and I are boostered but in fact did test positive around the same time frame as our neighbor did. We had no symptoms and wouldn't have known had we not tested ahead of a family gathering his immunocompromised mom wanted.   Had this neighbor and us been socializing in one of our houses or at a restaurant I would be consumed with asking myself what if it were me who gave it to him? Ninety-eight of every 100 adults here are vaccinated--so most likely a vaccinated person gave it to him.  This is why it's hard to hang out with unvaccinated friends.  A bar or casino full of randos is one thing. There's less of a sense of responsibility.

I'm triple vaxed and if they offered another booster tomorrow I'd take it. I still wear a heavy-duty mask (N99) indoors but I wouldn't feel safe going anyplace if I weren't vaccinated.

You saw the changes but I bet your mom would not have wanted you to change a routine that had been so much a part of her life and yours for 10 years.  You should have no regrets and absolutely no guilt. You did an amazing job you were a loving caring daughter.  I know what you mean about the quiet. The morning the Funeral Home came to take my Husband and I shut off the bed I could not believe how quiet the house was. I actually turned the bed back on later and slept in it just to hear the \"noise\". For months I would wake up at the same time I did for 5 years to check on him change him and make sure he was not tangled up in sheets. (and to see if I needed to change the sheets as well) For a long time I would check my watch to see if I had time for 1 more thing before I had to get back before the caregiver had to leave...only to remember that there was no caregiver that I had to get back for.  All that passes.  The difficult thing now is to find your \"New Normal\" and to find out who you are now that you are no longer a full time caregiver. Rediscovering yourself finding out who you and your husband are as a couple.   Forget what I call the \"Wouldacouldashoulda\" you can not change what was you can only move forward.   Your mom is still with you. I bet there are times when you see her in the mirror when you laugh you hear her laughter. When you see your kids there is a bit of here there as well.

{"post_id": "473355", "title": "3 Weeks After My Mom Passed", "body": "Your mother was like mine: tough and strong right up until the bitter end. Like my mother she got up and got dressed every day went into the activities room at her Memory Care ALF and was the cheerleader for others. I marveled at how she could DO that day in &amp; day out at 95 years old with more issues than Newsweek. Yet she did. Until one day she went to bed and became unresponsive and died exactly one week later. Without much 'warning' either. But the way I look at it she lived life to the best of her ability right to the very end. And so did YOUR mother.   You didn't miss anything nor were you in 'denial'. Your mother played the game of life beautifully until she could play it no longer. She was loved and cared for by you and your family and she felt that love on a daily basis. Stop beating yourself up for what you 'didn't' do or what you 'missed' and realize this: Mom didn't want you to know she was fading away as my mom didn't want anyone to know SHE was fading away. They lived life to the fullest until they couldn't anymore then God took them Home as mercifully as possible.  It's okay to cry and to feel the loss that mom's absence has made in your life. It's not okay to feel guilty for something you 'should have' or 'could have' done but didn't. You did everything to ensure she had a good life and mom is smiling at you from up above and saying GOOD JOB dear daughter!", "date": "2022-02-28 12:24:02", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/3-weeks-after-my-mom-passed-473355.htm"},

Your mom would not want you now crying over theses things. Instead she would want you to focus on the fact that you were able to live with and care for her and give her the best quality of life possible under her health circumstances. That should bring you great peace and joy.  And know too that feeling a sense of what do I do now that I don't have someone to care for is quite normal for us caregivers. I cared for my husband for many years and after he died I wandered around my house for months wondering what it was I was supposed to be doing now. He too was on oxygen for the last 22 months of his life and I had to get used to the quiet in my house after he passed without the oxygen concentrator running but I can tell you now that I really enjoy the quiet in my house especially first thing in the morning. So give yourself time. You will adjust to what will now be your \"new normal\" and allow yourself time to grieve and remember the many good things about your mom and that how very blessed you were to have a mom that you actually wanted to care for and have in your home. Not all of us have been that blessed.

Remember to try to change out your G-WORDS because words matter in our brains. GUILT means you are an evil doer who did things all wrong on purpose and everyone suffered for it and would you have done things altogether differently your Mom would be here. Those in our world who SHOULD feel guilt are for the most part incapable of it.  But GRIEF knows that you suffered in pain WITH your Mom in confusion about what was best and that you tried to do the best FOR her given you are not god but a human being with limitations and no magic wands.  You saw her comfort and you know now you need never fear for her again; she is at peace. You can remember the comfort she had and can celebrate her life. The experts say sometimes we stay in \"guilt\" so we don't have to face Grief because grief feels so final. It means you have to let go. And you will have to but you will do it in your own way your own time and while you live on some level your Mom will always be there with you. I am 80. My Mom is Frances and she is there for me still a friend a helpmate.  When my beloved brother died a man I always exchanged long letters with when we didn't live in the same city I continued to write him tell him things I wished could have been different told him what I saw that day that made me smile and remember him decorated it with pressed flowers and collage. About one year later a bit before I felt myself letting go (more it felt as though he were \"moving away\" from me \"moving on\"). Whatever it was I think of him daily still always with a smile wonder sometimes if I am changing him into a mythological creature who was \"almost always good\". I just embrace the \"magical thinking\" of this time. And I let myself wonder. Please stay on Forum. Please answer and help others.

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge.

(All that information is easily found from reputable sources.)  Yes in the end it's a personal choice. What's unfortunate it the \"ain't no one going to tell me what to do\" attitude that so many use to defend a choice that can ultimately end in your own death. It makes absolutely no sense.

Absolutely loved my Nana living with us. We were jumping with joy when she moved in. Every night my Nana would sit with my sister the youngest and review her spelling words.   Caregiving is nothing new. Years ago the word \"Assisted Living\" even the word \"Caregiving\" was unheard of. We called it \"taking people in\". Could be Auntie So and So who broke her hip and needed some convalescent. Prior to the apartment the family room would be turned into a makeshift bedroom (a/k/a sleeping on the sofa) the other Nana is coming to live for a while until she decides what she wants to do since Grandpa died. My family has seen it all.  There 's going to be pros and cons. Nana who lived with us paid board--small amount. Mom cooked all the meals but Nana had her own phone tv and bathroom. After supper Nana would retire to her apartment watch the news and settle in for the evening. The added \"board\" gave us some nice \"extras\". For us it was a win-win situation. I never felt alone always had a group around the table and always felt I had someone to talk to. My cousins Aunts and Uncles always visited because Nana lived with us. We were known as \"The Clan\".  My sister-in-law was not happy about \"The Clan\". She grew up having a 20 year span between her only elder sister and herself. So when she was born her sister was already out of the house and married. My brother was forced to make a choice it's me or them she told him. She did not want both but could have. The problems that have stemmed from that were isolation of their children from family events babysitters that were picked out of the newspaper and very low attendance at any of their family celebrations--Communions Graduations Weddings Births. They have no relationship with 1st cousins the way I have and it's a total 360 from the way my brother was raised. Please don't do this to your husband he will get resentful as my brother is but it's cheaper to keep her.  I know it's different today with people \"needing their space\" but overall if you can put up with people's quirky ways I think at least in my home life it was well worth it. My mother was the eldest of 4 the only girl in an Irish family which also means you do everything as I do now for my mother and willingly. There was never a time in my mother's mind where she thought she wouldn't do this and I am of the same mold. I have never abandoned my post. My Mother was a young widow.  In all honesty I don't know of anyone at least in my social circle who can afford Assisted Living. It is extremely expensive to live in the Northeast. The senior housing list is a mile long. You could have a family meeting and set down some ground rules and change things as it goes along. I wouldn't exactly label it \"tell me what you don't like about me\" but more like--lights out at a certain time tv low in the evenings if they take their hearing aids out buy them a headset. A separate phone line is better and decide who takes the mail in etc.   My dad a wonderful man was also going to have his mother move in and add another apartment downstairs. The Mexicans have the right idea. They stick together. You see the children hanging out of the grocery cart with Nana helping out. This is how I was raised just like the Mexican families! \"A strand of (3) cannot be easily broken\". Everyone I knew and this was in the 1980's lived like this. This was my norm and I wouldn't trade it for the world! Amen...

Here's how...", "body": "I posted previously on this if anyone is interested in reading the history on it. Briefly mother has mid-stage dementia and lives alone. Super stubborn and has said for years that she never wants to move. No longer drives (because I anonymously reported her to DMV because she was getting lost) and therefore relies on me for groceries Dr's appts etc. I'm an only child single mom who is doing the best she can to help from across town but it's become super stressful to manage. Got her to sign POA a few months ago before her conditioned worsened.Today I took her to neurology appt (her 2nd) where the neurologist and I both let her know for about 30 minutes that it was unsafe for her to live alone and that is was crucial for her to move. She was a little testy during the appointment because she felt ganged up on but we let her know that we are just trying to help her because often those with dementia can't see what others see. We let her know that after this appointment we had a 2nd appointment to go visit an assisted living facility. Unbeknowst to her earlier in the week we had already been there (under the guise of testing for her primary care doctor) where they had done the initial assessment and SLUMS test. That way they could determine if she was assisted living vs dementia resident. At the assisted living appointment we had same conversations with her but also did a tour of the facility and specific rooms. We sold it under the guise that her doctor set this up because she's worried about her weight loss her nutrition socialization and brain health. She'd be on a \"30 day program\" and we could evaluate it after the 30 days and see if she'd like to renew. This way it makes her feel that she has some agency in the decision overall and that she can leave after the 30 days if she likes (it's month to month so it's not entirely a fabrication). We just stayed with the conversation until we got a yes. She seemed to really like the fact that it was month to month and that this program could help her brain and help her feel better (which is SO true because she'll be eating drinking water and socializing at the very least). She currently sleeps about 20 hours a day and is forgetting to eat.So as you might imagine I'm so very relieved and happy to have her placed very soon and have all of this caregiving maddness behind me. All of this is such a wild ride. I'm happy to being able to return to being a daughter and not a caregiver.Hope this helps anyone that might need some ideas.", "date": "2022-02-26 00:48:53", "user_name": "reasoa", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Care Decisions", "Moving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-mother-with-mid-stage-dementia-agreed-to-assisted-living-heres-how-473310.htm"},

It is Feast: True Love in and out of the Kitchen. I just finished Jamie Raskin's book Unthinkable about January 6th and about the suicide of his son. Highly recommend. A wonderful man who tries hard to see both sides. And what an education: For instance at 80 I never knew that until 1913 it was our Congress who elected our Senators not \"we the people\". Most profound from him is this quote which shows how differently we think in our country how divided we are: \"As the senaors exit and the House members resume their usual places I look to my left and see the Democrats and to my right I see the Republicans. I recall a conversations I have with a Republican colleague Rep. Clay Higgins of LA. once when we were sitting on the floor. 'What do you see when you look out over our side and then over your side'? I asked Clay who is a good- natured man with an awesome Cajun accent. \"He looked at me and said 'you tell me first'. 'When I look at our side' I said 'I see America today in all its glory; black white hispanic asian-American LGBTQ straight gay women men immigrants native-born. And when I look at your side I see America in the 50s.' (Clay replied) 'When I look at your side he said I see the Coasts New York and California. When I look at my side I see the heartland'. End of quote from this book. Really if we could just think and talk to the \"other side\" how much we could learn about the differences we all feel see believe. And how much more alike we might admit to be in our thinking than the rhetoric we are forced into when forced to \"choose\" those sides?

(she was in any case all her life an extremely smiley person; always laughing). the facility was super clean caring.  i visited a friend\u2019s dear parent in a facility in croatia. awful!! very sad. but there was no choice. my friend can\u2019t keep her mother home. (i\u2019m not saying all facilities in croatia are bad).  \u2014on the other hand in some cases keeping a LO home is the best thing to do!   it\u2019s so case-specific. \u2026where you live (town/city\u2026) \u2026how much money you have \u2026how old is the helping adult child \u2026how difficult is the LO \u2026what does the LO want \u2026etc.  \u2014\u2014\u2014 i personally am not against - all - facilities in the world.  i\u2019m against the facilities where i live (when i say \u201cwhere i live\u201d i don\u2019t mean my entire country. i mean where i live).   but even if the facilities would be great i would do all i can to keep my parents home. but that\u2019s because in my case it\u2019s possible. we can hire caregivers. and my parents are extreeeemely happy at home.  if absolutely necessary my parents are absolutely willing to go to a facility. none of us in our family say \u201cnever\u201d. we know there are many factors. unexpected factors can come up.  \u2014\u2014\u2014  it\u2019s amazing to read on this website all the love people give their LOs (whether in a facility at home whatever).  you can feel so much love.  you can also feel the huge challenges many of us face in this rollercoaster of emergencies/helping our (kind or mean) LOs.  \u2014\u2014\u2014  hugs! one step at a time.  :) don\u2019t sacrifice your ONE life health\u2026  live a full life!!! :) :) :) don\u2019t wait for someone to rescue you.  bundle of joy :)", "date": "2022-03-01 15:57:31", "user_name": "bundleofjoy", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-mother-with-mid-stage-dementia-agreed-to-assisted-living-heres-how-473310.htm"},

{"post_id": "473805", "title": "Move where you want, not because of housing prices. Right?", "body": "I would never be in the camp of moving where you want regardless of costs to live there. I don't know when it started that people decided (to live on credit cards) to live the life they want; it's been prevalent at least the last 20 years.  I moved around a lot in my earlier years always living beneath my means or right at them b/c I had no choice. As I aged and my income increased I still lived beneath my means.   This offers a lot of opportunities. Freedoms. Less stress. I could change jobs if I wanted even if they offered less money. There came a time where I didn't have to sweat the big stuff when it rolled around (and big stuff is always right around the corner). Etc.  I'm not motivated by money but you need it. That said I tried to work jobs that gave me purpose or enjoyment whatever...but none offered a salary that you see these days. I never got above middle-middle class and then that was only because of a single job I held for 14 years and combined with my husband's income.  Now that I'm in my older years it's paid off in ways that end up very important yet in reality I hadn't considered them as such.   We bought a bit of a fixer-upper 20 years ago b/c it checked all the boxes of what we wanted and was purchased for less than what we were approved for .   Sunk a lot of CASH into the house; didn't even have a credit card then(!).  The 30-year mortgage was paid off in 14 years.  My credit score even without credit cards was 810 or 820. (My husband had the same mindset as me--live beneath your means--which made life a lot easier to navigate.) His credit score without credit cards was 820.  When we started buying new vehicles b/c we tired of used we got excellent interest rates. We were able to buy two new vehicles in one day b/c even though we weren't \"well off\" we had a nice discretionary income and stellar credit. (We'd both been able to buy two new vehicles we always wanted--another win!)  We didn't live a dull life b/c of our approach. He was a musician on the side--very expensive. We had Harleys (one at a time) and he was finally able to buy a brand new one; it was paid off a year early. And of course he was a guy so he had big-boy toys. None of it was a problem.  I'm now a widow and my income is waaay down but the house is paid off my expenses are covered. I don't have to stress about this or that getting shut off or bill collectors etc. And b/c I keep expenses down there is the occasional month that rolls around here and there where I'm actually able to put a few extra hundred dollars aside beyond what I put in my budget to save. (Though I've been known take a bit of that to the casino lol.)  It's less about saving more about living in a manner that allows you to live with less stress or worrying about the \"what-ifs.\" I'd rather have a nice little house than a \"better\" one I could lose b/c of the economy job loss death/divorce etc.  No matter how much money the average working person makes they're only a paycheck away from potential disaster.

Dishonesty is often a NECESSITY where dementia is concerned as many of us know who have been down this road for years with elderly parents. Most of them won't believe us anyway so why go there? If a person is 60 and in full capacity of her mind then perhaps an \"honest\" talk is required. For those of us with 90 year old or older mother's who have no coping skills or mental capacity to begin with telling them they have dementia is cruel. I always told my mother she had memory issues AND mobility issues that caused her to move from regular AL into their Memory Care building after she became wheelchair bound. One time her doctor spoke to her about \"dementia \" and she had a meltdown. She always insisted the other residents were \"stupid\" and had issues but she was fine. She was entitled to her delusions.  Same thing with those who insist you be totally \"honest\" with your demented mother when she keeps asking where the dead relatives are. If you tell her they're dead she gets to relive that trauma each time you \"break the news\" which could be daily! Speaking of cruelty! We use what's called therapeutic fibs to deal with dementia patients because the whole goal is to keep them happy and anxiety free as much as humanly possible. The vast majority of material you read on the subject will back this up.   How you handle this situation is up to you of course. If you feel like your mother can handle hearing she has a dementia diagnosis and it will serve some useful purpose to tell her so then do it.

{"post_id": "473282", "title": "My unvaccinated next-door neighbor is now dead.", "body": "In the last 3 months I've known 3 people who died from covid. All were unvaccinated all had underlying conditions such as diabetes prior smoking obesity. Sometimes I think men wait too long to seek medical help (this is a generalization) and then show up in the ER already too far gone for treatments to be effective. Who knows: maybe your neighbor might have been a smoker in his teens until quitting at 40 but still long enough for permanent lung damage to have occurred. He may have been in denial about his risk level.  Then there's my husband: 64 unvaccinated and has not even been sick since 2019. He went on a missions trip to Turkey this past December and had to have PCR tests before traveling there and back but in Turkey spent a lot of time without a mask and among many unvaccinated people. It's not that he was sick at some point in the past few years and didn't get tested - he has not been sick period. I got original covid in March 2021 got the Pfizer vaccine in July then (probably) got Omicron in early December (but didn't bother to get tested because there was no point). My eldest son (age 31 also unvaccinated and a smoker) has been mildly sick but never tested. His own elementary-aged son has had covid.   I think some people have some sort of natural immunity and I think some people have the opposite: an unknown biological Achilles heel when it comes to covid. We are all on a spectrum. Just like some people have a reaction to the vaccine enough that it kills them but this is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless it has happened.   In May 2020 my MIL in LTC got original covid and was at death's door. Went on hospice and then had a rapid and full recovery. Her only underlying health condition was being 85. She was overweight at 185 and 5'6\". Nine other people on her floor died during that outbreak.   This morning I was power walking with my friend in the Mall of America (a gigantic mall). She has 2 twin grandsons who were born at 23 weeks and are now 15 months old but have compromised lungs and too young for the vaccine. My friend still has to follow rigid protection protocols if she wants to babysit her grandsons. It is very hard on her and her husband (because they still mostly socially isolate and don't dine out) and she has no idea when she can drive in a car with another person or stop wearing 2 masks while mall walking 6 feet away from me. Even if everyone else was following her protocol she would still be doing it too because she wouldn't want to risk the lives of her grandsons or not ever see them in person. So the wisest philosophy is to let everyone live as they choose and if you're someone at risk then you have to do what you must to protect yourself.   No one should be telling anyone else how to manage their health. Your neighbor had every right to reject the vaccine. Freedom isn't free because there are consequences to the choices we make. Everyone needs to calculate their own risks and live accordingly.", "date": "2022-02-24 13:42:30", "user_name": "Geaton777", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/my-unvaccinated-next-door-neighbor-is-now-dead-473282.htm"},

It may or may not be.  I don't think it is. Think it may have been worded better though. It's not necessarily related to *abuse* of the system. Fees/charges can happen on the first call in some areas.  Most of you maybe 99%? live where fees like this will never happen. Count your blessings.  Some of us - on the other hand unfortunately live in areas in the USA where Medics DO charge high fees for lift assists and also for calls in which the patient declines transport.   For example where we live - the fee for an ambulance that is dispatched and cancelled after making contact with a patient who refuses care has gone up to $300.00 this year per incident. Even if it is the very first time you called 911 in your life. If you choose to decline the services - you are billed. And insurance will not pay.  The cost of a simple lift and assist (not for repeat people either) this will happen on your first call - is presently $175 this year. Insurance will not pay either.  Don't know if this will be a trend. I hope not. But it makes life much harder on us Caregivers.  I used to live in a city where we had to pay a fee each year or else any call involving medics/fire department resulted in very large bills. We happily paid the fee each year and we never once had to use their services back then. I think that is an excellent solution to paying higher fees for service.  Editing to add: That if the OP means the charges are a punishment for 911 *abuse* that is not how it works. Legally.

It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him. Quite to the contrary the more I loved him the worse he treated me. I was trained by my mother who was very similar to him so my whole life I have been destroyed by jealous people. The more they tortured me the more I needs validation so I threw myself into my work and my hobbies. As a result I became more successful which only made things worse. I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave. I filed for divorce because he is going to keep caregivers refuses to go to Assisted Living until he uses up all his savings. At that point I realize his wife (me) would have to pay his expenses thus using up all my savings leaving me with nothing for when I can no longer care for myself. My kids see only the fake dad the perfect one making me look like the evil person. I have lost them we still see each other but it is very strained. My advice to you go no contact. She will destroy you. You deserve better. You will feel the weight is lifted off of you. Don't feel guilty. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about. Send cards and call. Don't go.

Many times this is an all day event. Then He direct me to Bible verse after Bible verse about His comfort love strength and I feel His presence.  By the end of the day there is a feeling of calmness and love that is all encompassing. Why not try it?  Though I may stumble I will not fall for the Lord upholds me with his hand. - Psalm 37:4  And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard my hearts and my mind in Christ Jesus. - Philippians 4:7  He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. - Isaiah 40:29  Don\u2019t be afraid for I am with you. Don\u2019t be discouraged for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. Isaiah 41:10  Give me strength and patience O God that I may be as loving gentle and patient with others as you have been with me. Through Jesus my Lord and hero I pray. Amen.  For I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength. Philippians 4:13  Don\u2019t worry about anything; instead pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done. Philippians 4:6  I have been a caregiver for almost seven years and it is the most challenging unrewarding abusive experience I have ever endured. On the other hand it is because of these experiences that it has driven me every closer unto my Beloved Poppa Jehovah my best friend Jesus and my most amazing Mentor The Holy Spirit.  For that I am grateful. Joseph a son of Jehovah   Thank you Poppa for blessing me with Your Divine peace. There is no need to be afraid nor worried because I know You send The Holy Spirit to walk through the hard times with me.\u00a0Joseph a son of Jehovah   Thank you Poppa that You are always here with me. Thank you for guiding me in every aspect of my life. Thank you for Your daily support. Thank you always love me support me protect me heal me encourage me. Thank you that You always provide for my every need. I praise You in the name of He with whom I need for eternal salvation Jesus Christ. Amen Joseph a son of Jehovah   I\u00a0endure long and I am patient and kind.\u00a0I am never envious or boil over with jealousy.\u00a0I am not boastful or vainglorious.\u00a0I do not display myself haughtily.\u00a0I am not conceited arrogant or inflated with pride.\u00a0I am not rude or unmannerly.\u00a0I do not act unbecomingly.\u00a0God's love in me does not insist on its own rights or its own way for I am not self-seeking.\u00a0I am not touchy or fretful or resentful.\u00a0I take no account of the evil done to me.\u00a0I do not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness but I rejoice when right and truth prevail.\u00a0I bear up under anything and everything that comes and I am ever ready to believe the best of every person.\u00a0My hopes are fadeless under all circumstances and I endure everything without weakening.\u00a0God's love in me never fails.1 Corinthians 13:4-8  Pray these as if you are talking with someone you trust and know they love you like no one else can because it is true.

Home prices are high in San Francisco where I live. But it isn't only the homes. It is everything. The food especially. Haircuts I am certain cost more but to live here in the city and get the big salon costs most have to travel in from the burbs; add that to the cost.  I think for some--the lucky ones--we can decide where we want to live. For others I think there isn't a lot of choice. The stories of living in New York isn't only about the cost of an apartment (if you can find one) but about the size. I heard a woman say the other day that they don't have a closet in theirs.

I still eat pancakes this way and will do the same with a waffle.

I started a new hobby a few months ago and it really does help with stress anxiety and depression. If you don't maybe explore something new! That's what I did. At some point their will be a new way of life. A new normal. You will get your own life back. Time to do what you want what you missed out on doing and everything in between! I sound pretty optimistic here?!? Eh? Well it's because I'm trying to see the light in this dark hell too:) one thing for sure. It's not a dull experience or for the faint hearted! It keeps you on your toes. Just try to see the glass half full and maybe set some \"future\" wants and goals. Baby steps for now. The big strides will come later. It's being prepared for the \"new\" normal is what I'm concerned about! How will it be? How will I adjust from living with and caregiving for 13 years to poof just gone?!? It's a lot. I over think it too sometimes!!! Back to my calming motto: one day at a time!! Love yourself too! Mom is lucky to have you! You deserve a pat on the back and time to pamper yourself! Go to Wal-Mart and get some bath bombs bubble bath a good smelling candle. Take a favorite book and have your own spa night after mom is asleep for the night! The good thing about old people is they live by a set schedule. At least my mom does. I know what she is going to do next before she does it!! That predictable. Point being their is some you time to be made. Keep coming back here bc this site helps us all. You got like 42 comments so far. I read them all and they helped me too! I really like how someone suggested pulling the creativity card. I love to write and journal so this is simple therapeutic tool we can all use in the midst of caregiving!!!

My father walked in one day on our cheery repast of sumptious beef broth and really yelled at my mother about it. Anyways...fast forward a few years on and some of the meals she made were really really good. I guess 'cause we'd moved into a very swanky neighborhood and all the other moms were cooking like crazy-this was at the height of Julia Child French food and James Beard. That lasted for awhile then being a narcissist all kinds of other foods were made. She had a thing for the wholistic vegan (and this was over 40 years ago) cooking....the Nixon bean burgers were almost inedible.....which took a few weeks to digest.  For those of youse who have picky eaters who won't touch vegetables there are lots of easy ways to sneak 'em into meals. Say....tomatoe \"sauce\"....cook down other vegetables of choice puree 'n add to the sauce.   Children have fairly sensitive taste buds so the sulfers in broccoli cabbage are pronounced to them.

Is it really that hard think that tye stresses of a poor paying job among other stresses should not be considered when it comes to what conditions contribute to a certain horrible outcome?

{"post_id": "473510", "title": "Anyone hear about the 23-yr-old aide who raped dementia patients in Ohio?", "body": "Agree to disagree I do not think people are born evil more so they are a product of a series of choices and events in their life that have reached a boiling point and snap.   As mentioned I agree not everyone who had a sh*t life / living a sh*t life or has no prospects turns sour so to speak. What I am saying is that it certainly does not help matters and does add to whatever issues they have faced or face before.   I am not making excuses for such people but I am not shocked if someone who has no control in their life for whatever reason feels the need to or desire to try and take control one way or another. I do feel it is safe to assume most people who live grinding work life and have all sorts of problems will not even entertain the idea.   Just like I am not shocked if someone who has not eaten in days makes the choice to steal some food.  Though to say such factors do not have the potential to add up and push someone over the edge is a tad disingenuous.  I mean I have no evidence to show a relation between income employment status type of employment living situation and the relation to crime. To be frank most likely will not look it up but I also do not believe people are inherently evil so to speak. Since I believe that does mean I believe something has to lead up to cause a person to commit great harm to another.   I have a clinic diagnosis of ASPD in short I am a true sociopath they do not us the term sociopath anymore. I have been battling this since I was a kid. I know I can go from zero to hundred in a fraction of a second. As my therapist has told life is aculmination of choices we make or are made for us. Sometimes people focus on the choices that were not made for us such as skin color type of family you were born into environment you were born into etc... verse the choices we have control over. Like how much effort you put into your school work if you willfully get into drugs.  In short some people make excuses for their short comings and blame the system and everyone else around them for their lives they live or they take personal responsibility and do something about it. That being said as they told me we cannot dismiss the concerns of elements outside of our control and how they can lead to choices are 100% in our control but do not see it as such.   It is hard to let go of the baggage and I am pretty sure all these people that do horrible acts have baggage they cannot let go of. Not making excuses but I am also not going to dismiss it either. I live it I easily could have gone down the route to doing something horrible growing up even now I always walk on a razors edge. I was lucky enough to get help early on and have been able to live a somewhat functional life because of it. My family was also upper middle class if they were not. Who knows what would have happened.   It sucks not feeling like you have options or control of your life and when you have no support it is easy to give into vile actions.

Not letting yourself be talked into something you knew would be wrong for you and your LO was also right. As for what kind of people a nursing home or care agency will hire. Well they will hire pretty much anyone. I worked for several different care agencies over the years and only one asked for a criminal back round check from the police department of the town I lived in for the last five years. That was easy because I live in the town I was born in. They still hired people who had criminal records though. None of it will ever get any better as long as the greed of the 'old age industry' is allowed to continue to operate as it is with no threat of consequences.  There are actual evil people in this world who get off on cruelty and torture. The kind of people who would sexually assault an elderly person with dementia in a nursing home. Or who would abuse a child. Or commit any number of heinous crimes.

The ability to make a proper judgment or have the proper judgment to know when to walk away or when to place a person as an example is something not everyone can do when emotions or bias are involved.  Not everyone can be a caregiver nor do I think you can train a person that is not cut out to be a caregiver to be one. I do not feel you can teach f to an adult compassion empathy understanding patience responsibility resiliency list goes on many requires to be a proper caregiver.  I played the game and put my LO that does not need the medical aspect of a SNF into a SNF despite everyone and their mother outside social work telling me it is not best for them I should use home care. They are still highly functional they are too young. All true points but it was unsafe for them to be in their home and it would have been unsafe for them to stay with me.   I was suggested to a bunch of caregiver resources books podcasts YouTube videos and seminars. No one really got it expect the social worker everyone claimed with enough effort I could do it. I knew couldn't had I tried I probably would have hurt her because I would have snapped. The social worker told me not everyone can do this and they wish employment side of things could be more selective but they cannot they need bodies and the turnover rate is extremely high.  I agree overall with what you are saying but I just do not see caregiver judgment as a skill we all have.

Spreading misinformation about end-of-life care is unhelpful but posts like these are delicate. Sadly some people do not fully understand the purpose of hospice care what it entails or how it benefits patients and their families. The dying process can be difficult to witness even for those of us who have cared for loved ones in their final days and recognize the value of hospice. Acceptance of loss does not always come easily and grief can trigger new or worsening mental health issues in some. \u00a0 This post has not been removed and I'll explain why. I strive to use a light hand while moderating. We're all adults here. Although some stories and details may come across as shocking or nonsensical my job is to enforce forum guidelines to the best of my ability while also fostering open communication. \"Believability\" does not factor into moderating unless a post violates some other aspect of AgingCare's comment policy. \u00a0 Maintaining a healthy sense of skepticism is crucial these days especially online. It's up to each of us to decide whether certain details a member provides are real perceived or fabricated. In the same vein deciding which posts and users to interact with is entirely up to you. Your contributions to this forum are invaluable. Please continue reporting posts that you believe violate our policies but don't waste your precious time and energy drawing attention to something you deem unworthy for whatever reason(s). \u00a0 Lastly I do have one respectful request: please refrain from decrying other members as trolls. Disruptive individuals are an unfortunate and inescapable of part of this digital age. Whether such an assessment is accurate doesn't matter. What does matter is that this labeling can and does discourage other legitimate people from seeking information advice and support here which is the purpose of this forum after all. \u00a0 I hope this clarifies our stance on this post and the process by which all forum content is approved edited or removed.

She got there this morning when we arrived there she was miserable!!!!!! SAID the room was too small. I am the youngest girl and I actually spoil her more. My brothers and sisters think my mom might take advantage of me because I used to always do everything for her and anything she wanted I got her!!! So that being said today she looks at ME while we just arrived in the NH and said to me \"I cannot belive you all took me here you told me you wouldn't. You are all abandoning me.\" And when she is telling me this my heart is breaking into millions of pieces!!! I ALMOST threw up. I looked at her and said \"Mom we do not know if you will be here forever.\" We are trying to get her into assisted living but her mobility is not quite back. She has come a long way but we want to see with PT if she can go further with her strength. So after I told her that she replies \"I am so disgusted with you all!!!!\" So in my head I am saying what the hell? It's all about her my mother!!! THE ONE I love and adore. I mean my siblings and I are doing everything trying to find her a nice place that's safe and clean with good people!!! THIS is her first day. It seemed nice but I am praying she will get a little used to it. I am preparing myself to get a phone call tonight about her. So that being said I have great support. My brother and sister have been so good to me. ACTUALLY they worry about me alot because I am very close to my mom and I helped her a lot more than they did. Right now after today I am feeling burnt out!!!! SO they told me to take a step back and worry about me. So as I was leaving her at the nursing home tonight she kept saying to me \"Put me in the room I might have to pee.\" She wears diapers but she does not pee or anything in them (which is ok) so she needs someone to help her to bathroom.

She should be called Edwardnette Scissor Hands.   The cat Miss Molly we are still trying to figure her out. She's about 3 or 5 years old looks like a panda bear mixed with a skunk and quite over-weight.  She had come to county shelter via a court order so she had been taken from her owner. I believe maybe because she is short-legged [not a munchkin according to the vet] that maybe the owner was trying to breed her to eventually have munchkin short legged cats.   With her short legs she cannot jump up on so many things like regular legged cats. We know how cats love heights. It took her awhile to finally be able to just jump onto the bed. With her weight she tends to roll off the bed when washing. When she runs down the stairs she usually can't stop at the bottom and rolls into the wall. Oops.   There are so many things I haven't been able to teach her.... like if a door isn't open wide enough for her how to open it herself. She will just sit there.

It is true that people can reach a point where they just can't change another diaper. Or clean more piss and sh*t off of the floor clothes and furniture of a hoarded elderly house. They cannot get through one more day of a person asking the same question or saying the same thing over and over again because they're in a dementia loop and fixated on it. The caregiver has to know when to walk away before they lose control themselves. I worked my last paying caregiving job for seven years. I actually enjoyed it the first couple of years. The client had dementia and mobility issues but was still functional with assistance. We went out all the time and had fun. I was responsible for all the housekeeping errands and helping her with showering and dressing but that was fine. I made top money too because it was private.  The client reached the point where she should have been in a nursing home. The responsibility of this client fell 100% on me because by this time the husband had passed. The out-of-town family did nothing. I stayed longer than I should have. If I left when the husband passed they would have acted and put her in a nursing home. I didn't because of the money. I never neglected the hands-on physical care. She was kept immaculately clean. Bed-bathed head to toe every single day. Her bed and house was always spotless. She was well-fed and her medication was properly handled. I neglected her emotionally though. I had burnout so bad by this time that I could barely stand the sight of her. I was a robot and worked in total silence. By this time I was naming my price and the family paid it. They had nothing but the highest respect for me as well. The job was ruining my life.  Caregivers have to know when to walk away. It's not so much about who's \"cut out\" to be caregivers and who not. It's a judgement call. I've known caregivers who were the most loving and caring. They wanted to help people and bought the \"rewarding\" job nonsense. Until they actually got into the work and their elderly clients didn't appreciate them like they expected and abuse happened. It's all about caregiver judgment and knowing when to walk away before abuse happens.

Such factors feed into despair and desperation. A person imo can only bear so much than snap. I have seen overly good people that in a million years would never imagine hurting a person let alone someone in their care. Yet have beaten the person in their care a person can only take so many diapers screaming etc... before they snap.   Not everyone is cut out to be a caregiver yet we market such a position as something everyone can do and pay accordingly due to it be labeled as low skill work. Imo it is far from low skill work it requires a specific perspective and personality that cannot be taught.  I do think it is disingenuous to even say that working a dead end job with little upward mobility living a life in stress about how you are one crisis away from being potentially homeless if they have children telling them may have to wait on their next pair of glasses that are broken or get made fun at school because you had to wear the same thing over and over being so overworked and tired thar you cannot even go to a school event for your child.   In short living a life in constant stress or worry is not healthy and unfair wages working conditions can even bring down the moral of person if they go through it long enough.  I am also not making an excuse for the person what I am saying is it does not shock me. Like in the field I work in it did not shock me the issues around Blizzard popped up. I think taking a look at the environment in which one came from or works in is not about making an excuse but it also something we need to consider. Sure many do not give in or cave but that does not mean the situation did not have an impact on what happened be it in caregiving or in my field of game development or Hollywood etc...  I agree it does not create evil and I do not think I have said it does nor do I think I said it should be used as an excuse. If that is how it came off I am sorry what I am saying is it does not shock me when someone is under constant stress suddenly breaks that is all.", "date": "2022-03-09 18:43:59", "user_name": "Sighopinion", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/anyone-hear-about-the-23-yr-old-aide-who-raped-dementia-patients-in-ohio-473510.htm"},

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch but knew very little about ranching so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand. Two cowboys applied for the job. One was a gay Mexican and the other a drunk gringo. \u00a0 She thought long and hard about it and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. \u00a0 The gay guy proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

Trembling he did as she directed. \u00a0 \"Now take off my boots.\" He did as she asked ever so slowly.. \u00a0 \"Now take off my socks.\" He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. \u00a0 \"Now take off my skirt.\" He slowly unbuttoned it constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. \u00a0 \"Now take off my bra..\" Again with trembling hands he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor. \u00a0 \u00a0 Then she looked at him and said \"If you ever wear my clothes into town again you're fired.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 (P.S. - I didn't see it coming either", "date": "2019-10-16 22:50:38", "user_name": "cuz49341", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/grossed-out-and-need-to-vent-just-caught-mom-using-my-toothbrush-to-comb-her-hair-138180.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

It's a contest of who can get the better of the other. The next day my hubby had an appointment with his doctor who is located in the same building next door to the vet. The Dr's waiting room and office was full of people waiting. A side door opened and the vet leaned in - he had obviously seen my hubby arrive.

We do not want to put her in nursing home. I heard some places pay for assited living her insurance or some programs help with that. We has her family feel nursing home is not where we want to take her. Please help and let me know some different resources places that they have elderly care where she can live. I appreciate information.\"  So your post is a bit confusing when compared to your profile. Is mom in the SNF for rehab or there permanently for the long term?  In either event give her time to ADJUST. When given an ear to complain into that's what she WILL do: COMPLAIN. She's nervous and worried about what to expect moving forward and will try laying a guilt trip on you so you'll feel sad and get her out of there. Which is a mistake b/c you placed her in the SNF for her own safety care and well being.  Your siblings gave you good advice when they told you to take a step back from this situation &amp; worry about YOURSELF for now. Mom is safe and you can worry about her later on. For now relax have a glass of wine and remember WHY you placed her to begin with.   Old age is hard especially when it's combined with disease mobility problems and ailments. We'd all like to be 85 with the body &amp; mind of a 20 year old but that's not how it works for the majority of us. If we had our druthers we'd all like to stay home forever 'age in place' or have millions of dollars to bring in whatever caregivers we'd need to insure we COULD stay in our own homes till death. But then reality sinks in &amp; forces us to realize that's not going to happen. So we have to cope and make the best of the deck of cards we're dealt. You didn't create this situation for your mother; life did. Life happened to her and you're trying to help her in reality which she will hopefully see one of these days.

Deal with that as she participated in rehab.   Talk to the Social Worker or contact your Area Agency on Aging and see what services are available to her as she nears the time to discharge her. But while she is there communicate with staff and make sure they are aware of the circumstances. Such as... Where will she go when she has to leave rehab?  Can she care for herself?  Can you or another family member care for her?  Do you or does another member of the family have the legal authority to make medical and financial decisions for her?

In a trial a Texas small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness a grandmotherly elderly woman to the stand. He approached her and asked 'Mrs. Jones do you know me?' She responded 'Why yes I do know you Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy and frankly you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie you cheat on your wife and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes I know you.' The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do he pointed across the room and asked 'Mrs. Jones do you know the defense attorney?' She again replied 'Why yes I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster too.

I'm so sorry for the loss of your dear father to Alzheimer's. I lost my mother on 2/22/22 to dementia so I know how you feel.

I consider it a great failing of the healthcare system.

Any disease of the brain including mental illness is so under-treated and not understood even now in 2022; we are all left to flounder around and figure things out for ourselves! Most doctors DO NOT understand dementia/Alzheimer's or any of the various dementia's in general and it's mind-boggling how alone we all ARE on this journey. My hope like yours is that advances will be made in our medical community to study the brain diseases and to learn more in an effort to help all who suffer and their FAMILIES to find coping mechanisms to deal with the behaviors.

{"post_id": "471635", "title": "Another visit gone south!", "body": "I don't blame your mother for crying when you tell her you'd end your life if you were in her shoes! Why would she 'like' your visits ? They should upset her actually if you keep telling her about stopping eating &amp; drinking &amp; taking 30 pills a day to keep you alive!   Your mother is suffering from dementia and is having a pity party for herself. As such yes she's ruining your entire mood when you go visit her so you know in advance what to expect from her. What I do when I visit my mother who lives in Memory Care &amp; has advanced dementia is I bring distractions to keep her OFF of the complaining subjects she likes to dwell on. I bring my dog who likes to sit on her lap and I bring my cell phone which is filled with videos and photos of her great-grandson which she likes to look at. Even the ones she's seen before and has forgotten about. I'll even pull up photos on Facebook of her nieces and nephews if I run out of other things to keep her occupied. I also bring snacks which she likes a lot so that's another thing to keep her occupied for a short while.   Find uplifting things to talk about and do rather than depressing things that add to her already funky mood that's my suggestion. It's not easy having dementia and living in Memory Care with other elders suffering from dementia that's a fact! As hard as it is for us to go there to visit them *and it IS HARD I acknowledge that* at least WE get to go back to our own homes when the visit is over with. I honestly dread going to the MC to see my mother each &amp; every time b/c I never know WHAT I'll find when I see her so it's always stressful and sad for me.

The first guy peers into it and says \"Wow! That looks deep.\" The second guy says \"It sure does. Let's throw a few pebbles in there and see how deep it is. We'll be able to tell the depth by how long it is before we hear the noise of the pebbles landing.\" So they pick up a few pebbles and throw them in and wait. Nothing. There's no noise. The first guy says \"Jeeez. That is really deep. I know let's throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise.\" So they pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait... and wait... Again nothing. They look at each other in amazement. Then the first guy\u00a0gets a determined look on his face and says \"Hey over here in the weeds there's a railroad tie. Help me carry it over. When we toss that sucker in it's gotta make some noise.\" So the two of them drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Once again not a sound comes from the hole. Suddenly out of the nearby woods a goat appears running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men then right past them running as fast as it's legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole. The two men are astonished with what they've just seen and look at each other in amazement. Then out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. He asks them \"Hey you two guys seen my goat out here?\" The first guy says \"You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!\" \"Nah\" says the farmer \"That couldn't have been my goat.

She lived in a very nice senior community (but alas did not have MC/NH). This was my break from life in America and connect with my schoolmates even take small tourist trips to explore parts of India with mom's home as a base.Mom became very forgetful &amp; there was no one in India to supervise her care with aides. The aides would show up late &amp; leave early etc &amp; her care became a nightmare . So I just moved mom over here and we will probably sell her house in the senior community. My inlaws my extended family are here husband &amp; kids have no interest in India.The point of all this is: I so miss visiting India - I spent the first part of my life there. I was 24 yrs when I came to America. It kills me to see other families planning summer trips there talking about ticket prices etc. I just cannot believe that there's no need for me to go there anymore. I could visit and stay in hotels - when covid is under control -- but it will never be the same as staying with one's family waving to the milkman talking to the newspaper guy in our language and the million little things that'd part of the daily life if only mom was there! It breaks my heart to stay in my country as a tourist.(I'm connected to the Indian community here in my town and attend cultural programs &amp; festivals but it can never makeup the thrill of \"flying home\" for summer and going back to your roots.)I'm so angry and in shock that mom's dementia has robbed me of a very cherished experience. I'm also an empty nester now and feeling every loss very acutely.Even if covid subsides mom is quite frail now and I doubt she can tolerate the plane journey to India and stay in her senior community like old times.Thank you for letting me ramble on and vent....I'm very grateful that mom is safe with me we have our health &amp; home etc..but some days these thoughts are not comforting enough.", "date": "2021-12-13 15:29:30", "user_name": "wearynow", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Mental Health", "Travel"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/i-feel-i-have-lost-so-much-with-moms-dementia-i-miss-my-home-country-471717.htm"},

There are many people who hardly ever see their family or have no family at all &amp; yet they are happy. They find 'family' where they are.   I think what she means is she is lonely. Is not feeling connected to people around her. It's understandable.   I imagine making connections gets harder as we age especially when you add in hearing loss others people's quirks &amp; impairments too.   But talking about lack of family visits is a little close to a blame game imho. If only family came I would be happier.. so my unhappiness could be their fault...  The bottom line is Mom's happiness is her own responsibility (not her family's). Her happiness is actually based on her own thoughts.

Aside from unforeseen unavoidable and \"bad luck\" events in some people's lives a main reason why receiving and giving care becomes a burden is because people are in denial and they don't plan and save. There are other factors like the cost of medical care and people who choose unhealthy habits but mostly many people just don't plan early enough.  My mom (the daughter of immigrants) was a single parent the entire time she was raising me (an RN who worked FT). She never received a penny of child support. YET she went on to own her own home (a humble home later in life and paid cash for it) owns her car has no other debt and lives comfortably on her savings. Because of clean living and the luck of the draw she is a very healthy 92-yr old. She has good financial means right now but if she has a profound medical issue she will burn through her savings pretty fast. Most people's life savings are used up in the last 18 months of their lives. At some point if she requires Medicaid so be it. This is what it's for (also funded by taxes).   Creating an adult care tax credit will require management by the government. Our large and inefficient government. Everyone else's taxes will go up to fund yet another program. IMO we should be lobbying for more transparency in medical and care costs so that there is accountability and we can vote with our wallets.

I have a guy who will rope the moon if I asked and does everything in the world to make me happy.And in some important ways I can\u2019t imagine anyone unluckier than me.I don\u2019t know how I ended up 49yo unable to work earlier because of two autistic kids and then after a good career now unable to work because of two 80 yo parents who decided they\u2019d like to fill the shoes my kids left empty except they\u2019re not my kids and they\u2019re not cute.Between ten specialists for dad and three for mom breaking up their fights nonstop both physical and verbal driving around hunting down an old man who keeps taking off after fights expecting I\u2019ll find him and neither of them understanding a thing doctors tell them so I have to drive them to every appointment and be there for EVERYTHING\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m going to die soon if I continue doing this.Just 2.5 years ago I moved them to me in NV from CA because my dad was on oxygen 24 hours per day and admitted to the hospital constantly due to CHF \u2014 a condition he\u2019d apparently had for ten years except he didn\u2019t understand when he was diagnosed so I didn\u2019t know for ten years until I finally went to a cardiology appointment with him. I visited often enough when I lived 7-8 hours away but only for a few days at a time because it\u2019s draining being around their fighting. I didn\u2019t even realize the depth of how he had deteriorated mentally as well.In one month I sold off their lives and listed their house and moved them closer to me because I KNEW my dad was going to die and if that happened my mom would likely dig in and refuse to move.I got them their new place found every reputable specialist in NV including getting him into the Cleveland Clinic for his neurological issues and began to manage his plethora of fatal health problems and managed their entire lives.And he got better. He got better and didn\u2019t die because Mom and I dedicated everything to getting him better despite the odds and he lived. The better he got the worse he became as a person. At least if he couldn\u2019t breathe well \u2014 he was in bed and quiet.The level of energy these two have to battle it out is unbelievable. Without going into detail I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s bad. And somewhere along the way in the last two decades these two feel they need to tell me every detail of how awful the other one is. In the last two years it\u2019s almost like they tell me just to see if I\u2019ll side with the one doing the tattling. (And in 99% of the case it\u2019s my dad who is completely wrong and beyond reasoning but only he doesn\u2019t see it.)I do more than enough.Every single thing they need I have to find and make happen. I read every one of their mail and every time my dad decides he found a better deal for his insurance or a car loan or a mortgage I\u2019m the one who has to clean it up. Their cell phones act up - call me. Their TVs don\u2019t work - call me. iPads die \u2014 call me. Got a phone call \u2014 tell the caller to call me. Drug store claims some drug isn\u2019t available \u2014 \u201ccall my daughter.\u201d It\u2019s me for everything except grocery shopping.This isn\u2019t a life.

I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I ended up having two stents put in due to 100% blockage and have been diagnosed with diabetes.Tonight I was just screaming and screaming at my dad after having found him walking the streets going nowhere after they duked it out when I was called to find him \u2014 and felt like something burst in my head and for a couple of hours the eyesight in my right eye had a white flash in it. I\u2019m OK now but can\u2019t catch my breath.I am falling apart and at this rate they will outlive me. I never agreed to give them my whole life.

When I was in my mid-40s their relationship significantly deteriorated and I had to constantly be the referee. It was a horrible position to be in. I swear I still have PTSD from the constant odd phone calls drama falls fights 911 calls. It went on for years. In my case my mom was the aggressor and my dad was beginning cognitive decline. There was also prescription drug abuse and alcohol use (not a good mix for 70 year olds). Anyway I eventually had to place my dad in memory care for his own safety. Mom refused to consider any other option (such as in-home care). It was chaos. I am an only child and there was no one else to step in. I thought my life was over.  I do believe placing my dad in memory care probably caused him to die earlier than he would have. To me the blame is on my mom for that. He died in 2019 after 3 years in the facility. Now I am stuck with her but through some good fortune I was able to get the house sold in 2020 and because of her alcohol relapses she ended up in ER/hospital/skilled nursing/assisted living. Unfortunately the physical &amp; occupational therapists have spent all of 2021 bringing her from wheelchair to rigid walker to rollator and now a cane. Last year at this time she was in a wheelchair in memory care babbling nonsense and now she is walking and wanting to live independently again.  I am not sure me or my marriage will survive another miraculous recovery on her part. I will be 55 in February. I have been stepping in and dealing with their sh*t since 2009.  I agree parents are absolutely not supposed to be like this. I never imagined either one of my parents would end up living a decade or possibly two in such a state. A middle-aged person should not have to sacrifice health career marriage happiness for unending years. This is not the way it was supposed to be. It's not like caring for a child.

As someone who is in a similar circumstance my first thought is to take care of your own health first. Immediately actually. I'm concerned about your eyes. Hire whatever help they need now so you can focus on yourself. Then when you're feeling better you can sit down and make a plan on how to best move forward.   I don't know your situation but things didn't improve for me until I told my siblings that I quit. We started working together as a family after that meltdown. It's amazing what can be accomplished if you have help and support from family. If not hire the help and support.  During a discussion we had with an elder care attorney she told us about someone she had on staff. I can't remember the woman's title but the employee would go into the home and evaluate the loved one and then make recommendations for care. She was like a geriatric social worker.   My husband and I have been held hostage for so many years I'm embarrassed to say because neither of us had the gumption to stand up for ourselves. As a result we've been caregivers for the three parents between us without help from family. Now I say \"Two down one to go.\" Dark humor forgive me.

Neither you or your mother will win a argument when trying to reason with someone with dementia. His ability to reason is long gone as is the executive ability required to manage his life. Some of what is occurring is because he is no longer mentally competent to initiate actions or control himself. Given the constant fighting and the post-fight wandering your dad might need to be in a memory care or even a nursing home given his overall poor health.

It came unexpectedly although she's been declining for the past 6 months. I believe she had a TIA about 12 days ago b/c her upper lip was droopy and she was slumping over more than usual in her wheelchair. The hospice nurse advised that TIA are oftentimes precursors to bigger events down the road. On Sunday of this week she could no longer sit up in her wheelchair &amp; had to be moved into her easy chair in her apartment. On Tuesday she went to bed and has been there ever since. I feel like she may have had a real stroke but we'll never know for sure.She's now developed a fever and is short of breath; the nurse feels heart failure is at play. She's being kept comfortable by hospice who's been marvelous since they accepted her in late December. I've been visiting her every day &amp; listening to her whisper to someone she's having a conversation with that I can't see. It's probably one of her beloved late sister's she's been talking about incessantly for months now. :)We are scheduled to leave for AZ next Friday for my DH to have a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. We can postpone the trip if necessary by about a week or so. I don't feel like my mother is going to last too much longer in this condition though but only God knows her future.Please keep us in your prayers if you are so inclined as this is a particularly difficult time with mom's transition and an impending liver transplant coming up.

And it cost $1200 to fix the garage door.  They won\u2019t touch him because of the massive health problems\u2014at least not without significant bloodshed. The only thing they\u2019ll do is throw him in an ambulance to be held at a hospital on a psych hold because he went nuts on the cops \u2014 and then I\u2019m called to take him back home. I tried to get him admitted to the psych ward officially \u2014 and the social worker agreed \u2014 but the doctor said it wasn\u2019t warranted because he\u2019s calm now.  It was literally better if the police hadn\u2019t been called because then I had to bring home an enraged man back to the same house and either leave my mom there with him stay there myself to ensure her safety or bring her to my home.  I suppose I could not have picked him up and left him there. I freely admit: I don\u2019t know how to do something like that to my own father. I didn\u2019t speak to him on the way home or for a week after until he apologized but clearly there were no lessons learned be it from the police or from how I handled it.

He\u2019s a well-educated MBA man who worked to the high ranks at a US conglomerate before retiring and he\u2019s deteriorated to making no sense and can\u2019t process what he hears be it in English or Korean. Can\u2019t hear that well and what he does hear he can\u2019t process. (They\u2019re concluding its vascular dementia but specifically not Alzheimer\u2019s which has been ruled out.) And everyone can see it EXCEPT HIM. He\u2019ll still actually tell me he knows better or he doesn\u2019t need the likes of me etc. unaware he can\u2019t do anything for himself.  Worse he creates more work for me having to undo these ridiculous scams he falls for \u2014 Cheaper Medicare! Better refinancing rates! Save money with solar! Free HBO! \u2014 and so forth. All the calls and paperwork I have to do for them doesn\u2019t anger me but when he MAKES trouble\u2026 I just get enraged. And he\u2019s not even apologetic; he says \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Call and cancel it and stop acting like you\u2019re doing something extraordinary!\u201d  Everything else meh \u2014 I\u2019ll live. I make all the food they love and have them over or deliver it and go out to dinner with them every week. I take them out to social activities they like and my husband is a good sport about going with us. When they have to drive a ways to meet friends and it\u2019s nighttime we drive them there and find something to do for five hours so they can have fun. They need only get dressed and wait for me on the days we have appointments and attend; they don\u2019t need to listen to one thing the doctors say or follow up with a single item \u2014 I do it all. Literally all they have to do is not create chaos and I\u2019m willing to go to the ends of the earth to make their last years easy for them but it\u2019s like they\u2019re hellbent on sending me off first!

{"post_id": "471606", "title": "Don\u2019t feel like doing this anymore.", "body": "@countrymouse you are correct. The situation I am in was indeed my choice and my decision. I moved them here because it was clear they couldn\u2019t manage their care anymore. Be it a sick dad or sick mom I can\u2019t live with the fact that either died without my having done all I could.   Contrary to what I make it sound like in my original post (1) they were not bad parents to me growing up all things considered; and (2) I actually don\u2019t regret moving them here to manage their care. Even doing everything for them is not altogether torture for me in that giving them a few full-time years of my life to ensure a comfortable ending is still worthwhile to me. I\u2019m lucky to be able to do that. I know that.  It\u2019s that they hate each other and live off this drama that kills me. It\u2019s that they have zero qualms about involving me in this drama of theirs letting \u2014 no demanding and forcing \u2014 their daughter witness the ugliness and misery they cause each other at the end of their lives that just\u2026rots me. It\u2019s truly like a black mold that just spreads and I hate it. That is what I feel \u201cparents\u201d shouldn\u2019t do. I hate that my parents do this and I hate that I let it get this close to us.   I have asked and begged to be left out of it. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care that my dad took off again or that they had a blowout fight but I do not want to be involved in that part. I don\u2019t want to know and if they can\u2019t handle their own tempers to ensure they live peacefully they should deal with the repercussions of that on their own too. I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m savage and callous - but they don\u2019t understand I really cannot operate like this.  I\u2019ve explained that my life and my relationship with my husband are so peaceful and zen BY CHOICE and that I can\u2019t deal with the constant animosity they bring into it. It causes chaos in my own household (because it affects me) and it causes me embarrassment that my parents are living out the end of their lives like this. My sister and I live petrified that I will turn out like this.  Because this part comes with the other parts I willingly manage and like you said it was my decision when I knew their relationship was not great when I moved them here (since they involved me in that part then too though in my defense I had no idea to what extent or frequency this happened!) I do regret my decision\u2026.now.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "I'm a 36 year old only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7 I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills endless phone calls mountains of paperwork and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating.  Add to that I'm really sick of being a caregiver already and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week came home for a week went in for another week and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her and I feel bad about it. I apologized but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same.  I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot. I'm tired of being trapped in this house not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion. I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984 she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so.  The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings at home with me.  So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

I take care of my Mom full time but I had enough years in to retire with a comfortable income. My Mom has dementia and requires almost full time care but I have my brother who always helps out and is very cognizant of what my Mom needs. What you are doing is just. too. much. for. one. person. My Aunt is my support person (she lives in Florida) took care of her husband until she had to place him in nursing home. He died from Alz and diabetes. While he was in the NH she went at lunch time to make sure he ate and then at dinner time. She never missed a day. She also went to support groups and learned a lot. She tells me every time I talk with her - Number One: Never feel bad or guilty about losing your patience or temper or what you say or yell. Number Two: You are doing the hardest job in the world. Number Three: You are doing more than what most people would do. Number Four: No one else has ANY idea how hard it is - unless they have done it too. I really know how you feel about taking care of your Mom and not putting her in a nursing home but you really do need to think/consider about prioritizing some of your needs ahead of hers - such as working and having enough to live on and for retirement. I did therapy via zoom (or something like that) with a therapist that is near-by so I could see her in person some day and I highly recommend you do the same. I am really concerned that this is going to destroy you/your life the way it is right now. I really am. I also had a thought that maybe an attorney could get the medicare etc. in place instead of you doing it. At least if attornies do this you could get a price and see if it is feasible.

I got a recommendation from the SW or CM at the hospital from mum's last admission. I went with Visiting Angels because they had a local office in my parents town and when I called a real live person answered the phone. When I left a VM a real live person the same one multiple times called me back. They have have been great. Yes we got very lucky with an excellent aide who had capacity to take us on as a regular. If this is what you want make this known from the beginning with the agency. We have 3 times per week aide the same one every time for 3 hours a day. She mops the high use areas cleans the bathroom heats the food and makes sandwiches for supper washes the dishes and does the laundry takes out trash and provides them with some outside company and conversation. It is working out very well. She will go buy groceries if needed or pick up take away food too. The cost is less than $30/hr and if your mother has funds it is money well spent. You have to be involved at first. I was in the home when they started I wrote out check lists bought the cleaning supplies and stocked the bathroom and kitchen etc. But once you get a reliable aide with common sense and some experience after a couple of weeks of check lists its smooth sailing. I would Highly recommend them. But do be there when the aides first start coming so you can show them what is expected where things are and give them the low down on the parent - the good the bad and what you really need and expect. So they are not doing things you dont value and you are not always looking over their shoulder. Every day won't be perfect a couple times I found the trash was not taken out or the cat box was not scooped but 90% of the time its been great. We had only one who just came in sat on the sofa and played on her phone while my dad watched TV and talked to himself. (I walked in on this) But she was just a fill in for one day. The regular aides have been great and if/when they can't show the agency calls me direct and they will staff it with someone if at all possible. And as needs increase we can increase the coverage so they can stay in their home as long as possible. And if the aide cancels or quits the agency finds a replacement to staff your needs.

Austin Miles 1912  Songwriters C. Austin Miles Published by Public Domain The Story Behind In The Garden Here is the account of how this beautiful hymn was written from the hymn writer C. Austin Miles himself \u201cOne day in April 1912 I was seated in the dark room where I kept my photographic equipment and also my organ. I drew my Bible toward me and it opened at my favorite book and chapter John chapter twenty. I don\u2019t know if this was by chance or by the work of the Holy Spirit. I will let you the reader decide. That story of Jesus and Mary in\u00a0 John 20\u00a0had lost none of its power and charm. It was though I was in a trance as I read it that day I seemed to be part of the scene. I became a silent witness to that dramatic moment in Mary\u2019s life when she knelt before her Lord and cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I rested my hands on the open Bible as I stared at the light blue wall. As the light faded I seemed to be standing at the entrance of a garden looking down a gently winding path shaded by olive branches. A woman in white with head bowed hand clasping her throat as if to choke back her sobs walked slowly into the shadows. It was Mary. As she came unto the tomb upon which she placed her hand she bent over to look in and ran away. John in a flowing robe appeared looking at the tomb. Then came Peter who entered the tomb followed slowly by John. As they departed Mary reappeared leaning her head upon her arm at the tomb she wept. Turning herself she saw Jesus standing there so did I. I knew it was He. She knelt before Him with arms outstretched and looking into His face cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I awakened in sunlight gripping my Bible with my muscles tense and nerves vibrating under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. I wrote as quickly as the words could be formed the lyrics exactly as it is sung today. That same evening I wrote the tune. It is sung today as it was written in 1912.\u201d", "date": "2022-04-03 23:27:31", "user_name": "smeshque", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/count-your-blessings-435930.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

What would happen to her if you became too ill to take care of her?   Contact your Area Agency on Aging.

Never say never about a nursing home. Don\u2019t bring it up at this point. If it comes to it search through Medicare website to find the very best one you can. Visit her a lot. When a facility knows family comes a lot and is involved the care can be better because they know there\u2019s another set of eyes on the loved one.

I'm 39 and like you I was extremely overwhelmed in the beginning of my caregiving journey. My mom passed last month and the finality of her being gone is a tough adjustment; but I would have continued my sacrifice just to have her here. I don't know if you believe in something higher than yourself but I advise that you pray and turn to the word whenever you are feeling stressed resentful angry etc etc. I also advise trying to seek counseling/therapy to help with coping mechanisms while this journey lasts. I had no counsel in the beginning and I was my only help. I cared for my mom from roughly 18-39 years of age and that story in itself is something made for a movie which I won't divulge right now as I'm trying to be brief. In addition to what most of your supporters have mentioned regarding seeking someone to give u a break every week or so if it's financially possible or applying for Medicaid so she can have home health aides with her during the day while you tend to your needs you must also focus on your health and well being. We are consumed when caring for our loved ones that we tend to neglect ourselves. I have had way too much experience with hospitals rehab facilities etc etc. The healthcare system is broken and changes must be made. If your parent requires 24/7 care and help the countless facilities I have experienced will cause a decline in their health. Thank God for his blessings over my strength and patience as I was there from sun up to sundown once I realized the care given is not present so I was pretty much an unpaid worker whenever she was hospitalized or in a facility. Places lack the number of staff needed to help and nurses are overwhelmed with too many patients and when you witness this for over 2 decades it's heartbreaking and the quality of care is nonexistent. If ever you need to talk about the nitty gritty when it pertains to ALL THINGS related to caregiving please reach out. I tended to all my mom's countless needs and as time progressed more issues arose so I was in charge of medication administration feeding tube care tracheostomy care you name it....I was even taught how to give her antibiotics via her pic line at home. I have learned so much that I would not mind sharing with you or anyone else for that matter. Please pray and try your best to love her through her illness.

They may have counselors who can help you with the paperwork too. I also got help through my church with an extra caregiver so I\u2019d have more respite time. I had a camera on my dad at all times so I could monitor him with my phone. When he was safely tucked into bed each night I\u2019d go out for a walk with my dog. I found respite care counseling and exercise to be the 3 things that helped me the most. Also I tried to cherish any good things that happened since I knew I\u2019d be saying goodbye before long to each one I cared for during their illness. Hang in there.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "What a great thread. This has been a very valuable discussion for me as I'm sure for the original poster. My Mom is turning the corner on being 88 and just beginning to exhibit some memory issues and has incontinence issues. She's in excellent health otherwise. I've gotten her health POA and permissions to discuss her care with her GP Medicare etc. She agreed to do this so that I wouldn't have to deal with all that should she get sick. She lives by herself in a house built by her and my Dad. I moved long distance to live near her 6 years ago when my Dad passed away. My husband and I do lots of little things for her and we're happy to do it however she's beginning to let the house fall into disrepair. I had to have a talk with her to let her know that if she wanted to stay in her house she would need to get things fixed. She is financially well off so money is not the issue. I think she gets overwhelmed when there are too many things to take care of so she just ignores some things. I found a handyman to begin repairing and replacing some of the important things like getting one of her door locks replaced because it was broken. She reasons things away like this by saying she lives in a gated community and no one would be able to get in. Ugh! Her front door locks were oxidized and the key would no longer work so those are being replaced too. When I tried recently to get her to have other things fixed she said it was too much too fast. Big argument there so I let it go. I'm going to try again after Thanksgiving. Her memory issues worsened over the summer. It comes and goes. We live in an area where people live here 6 months out of the year (we call them snowbirds). Her friends are returning and she's as happy as a clam. She's been hacked three times and I worry that it's only a matter of time before it happens again and harm is done. (thankfully I caught all three in progress and averted the worst).  Problems with long and\u00a0short-term memory:\u00a0 1. forgetting that's she's already asked the a\u00a0question just\u00a05 minutes later repeats herself. Seems to come and go.\u00a0 2.Often reintroduces me to those I've known for several years. 3.Showed up a day early to pick up friends for dinner another day an hour early.\u00a0 4. Forgets that she's ordered something online or orders an excess of items.  5. Has several piles of mail around the house.  6. Can't keep up with her emails (I have access to that and clean out the spam for her)  7. It's hard for her to make phone calls for\u00a0things that need\u00a0taken care of or fixed. Gets confused as to who's who with vendors. 8. She has items that should have been returned a year ago sitting on her desk.  The list goes on and on. I try hard to help her with all of it but she's resistant and stubborn. The caregiving has barely begun and I'm already frustrated and angry. Thank you all for the advice!

Certainly she had enough time during her free Saturdays and Sundays plus all evenings to socialize with this sister but instead chose to disregard that SO has a very difficult less lucrative highly physical job.  He set that boundary. Like his parents he shares almost a phobia about seeing them naked let alone handling private parts.  BW doesn't have to really handle any actual ADLs but the time is coming. It could be here next month if certain treatment is ordered. I would call agencies myself and clarify what respite/advance ADL care is needed but MIL says she doesn't want anyone but DIL and aide in there so I'm respecting that.

And while I understand your (justifiable) anger with your brother's wife your anger with your SO's parents in their unfairness (paying your brother's wife when they wouldn't pay your SO) and even a certain amount of anger you might have with your SO (for perhaps not seeing clearly that he is/was being taken advantage of) all of that is in the past unable to be changed. The only thing you can do now is to move forward. And if the rest of your SO's family doesn't want to move forward along with you insofar as coming up with a plan when the inevitable happens and the ship is sinking it doesn't mean you have to refuse to get into the lifeboat.   Now as far as your SO not getting paid even when giving respite I know of no facility that offers respite care free of charge. If your MIL/FIL were using paid non-family care givers would they expect that whatever agency that was supplying them would give them free care over the weekends? Why has your SO not broached the subject for compensation on the same pay scale as SIL when he's covering his SIL's shifts? Or has he and he's been refused in which case he is free to tell everyone that \"no I'm so sorry those days don't work for me to cover I have other things I need to tend to.

About $30/hour or over market rate for an aide and more than fair even in the expensive area where we live.  DIL reinforces \"toxic positivity\" in that nothing negative can be said. She's always \"I can take care of people NO PROBLEM.\" But there is in that there is no care plan for two things in particular.  1) Respite beyond her Sat/Sun weekend. Hubs only has one day off really as he has to actually go to work to submit paperwork on the other day. She has a full weekend already that she won't swap out with the indy because...well...she and Brother need their weekends. And so do we. If there's an emergency of course but otherwise she needs to swap hours with the other aide for time off or duh bring in a third aide. That would be a plan.  2) ADL losses are already apparent. They could seriously be exacerbated by a) the three general-anesthesia surgeries FIL is planning to undergo in the coming months expressly including toileting and bathing. b) MIL's probable third line cancer treatment which carry an actually higher risk.

She was 85 yrs old when she came here to live in a home just 2 doors away from me. She just gave me the power to take over all her finances and keep the orderly running of her home. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. She was up and down in her health and my life became doctor visits taking her out to places she would enjoy and food shopping for her. I lost my own life completely. If the electric went out during a storm I worried. If we had a blizzard and couldn\u2019t get out I worried. Every minute of every day was thinking about her her bills that needed to be paid her medication refills her congestive heart failure problems her growing breast cancer her taking a shower just everything that a person needs in order to live comfortably. She was able to do so because I gave up everything for her. And I did resent her. She would not have done that for me. Now that she is passed - at age 95 (this past summer) I feel relieved but I am still stuck. I urge you to think about a facility that can care for her at her level of care. This is a situation that will eat you alive. I developed Non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 5 yrs into my caretaking and I know it was due to stress the first years of caring for her. I am still treating. I don\u2019t know how long I have as I am stage 3b and there are only 4 stages. My body could not take the stress of actually taking over someone else\u2019s life.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Might I make a few observations and suggestions.  1 - Your mom's care will be overwhelming if you are the only person caring for her 24/7/365. Burnout is inevitable if you do not get enough \"time off\" to meet your own health needs and social needs.  2 - While I admire your dedication to your mom and her care you are neglecting your own retirement. You need to secure your own financial state first and being with mom second. Nobody can secure your finances or retirement but you.  3 - Everything seems overwhelming. You need to sort out the issues and create a plan. Meeting with a social worker and a counsellor - even televideo meetings can help. The social worker can help you locate and access all the resources available for your situation. A counsellor can help you sort out the emotional overload and create a healthy plan for dealing with your mom.  4 - There are lots of ways that you can work get enough time off and help care for mom. You can not care for her 24/7/365 alone.   a - Ask for help from family friends community of faith and paid help. Some folks will be OK with sitting your mom for a few hours weekly. Others may be able to help with household tasks: housekeeping meals yardwork running errands...  b - if you can not get enough help to care for mom at home then it is time to look at outside resources. Adult Day Care is a Monday through Friday daytime option; they care for mom in a nursing home of private home while you work. Home health aides can also watch mom in your home while you work. Assisted living usually consists of having a private room or suite with home health aides that assist throughout the day. Full care is for those that need frequent care by others. Check to see if mom's insurance and finances will cover any of these services.   c - If mom doesn't have enough finances help her apply for Medicaid. Help her also apply for Medicare and any other public help. You can make an appointment with Social Service. It might help to review their websites and gather all documents needed. If your mom ends up in the hospital again ask social services to help you with these tasks.   d - If mom needs to use Medicaid for help she may be best served in a residential facility that takes Medicaid clients.   A good daughter or son makes sure that their parents are cared for... even if it means you can not do the hands-on care yourself.", "date": "2021-11-18 09:56:23", "user_name": "Taarna", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-new-to-caregiving-and-trying-not-to-drown-in-it-471198.htm"},

At $65K/year she is a paid professional. A professional does not beg her employers to replace the money that she lost through all fault of her own by having her own meltdown at the clients. A professional also does not just time her social occasions with my SO's weekend and then gaslight him with \"it's you're PARRENTS\" and all this when she would like to do something else. A professional would take it upon themselves to be educated about what the loss of ADLs actually is. FIL came home and wetted himself wanna know what she did? Nothing. And probably she could do nothing. MIL cleaned him up as she didn't want her child's wife to see his penis.  It's not like most situations here where most people are unpaid. She is handsomely paid.

She moved to assisted living two months ago where she is thriving: eating well making friends sleeping better etc. To get her to willingly pull the trigger we had to allow her to take her car.  A couple of weeks in she approached the administrator shopping list in hand and asked for directions to the grocery store. Since this isn't his first rodeo he redirected her - successfully he thought. She seemed happy with his suggestions (let us call you an Uber we have a shopping trip scheduled Friday and you could go then etc.) and went back upstairs to her room. Then during the 2 pm staff change meeting when nobody was looking out the door she went and she drove away. She didn't have her phone of course.  Eight hours later and well after dark (she hasn't driven after dark in years) the police were just about to put a vulnerable adult alert out on Twitter with photos of her and the car. My husband was on the phone with adult child #2 filling him in (we didn't want him to find out when his friends said hey isn't that your grandma on Twitter?) when her residence called to say she had breezed back in thanks to a Good Samaritan who had guided her back from the grocery store. Where else she had been she can't say.  The next day I \"stole\" her car. It is in the garage in her house which she still owns. She asks after it wonders why I took it why I hate her etc. I've ordered the police report so with any luck seeing it in black and white will convince her it actually happened.", "date": "2021-12-09 09:18:26", "user_name": "Ambrianne", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/are-you-on-the-naughty-list-471582.htm"},

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Oh goodness. I saw this in my email inbox and I knew that I had to come by and say something. My mom passed away last year. I am 39 years old. And I took care of my mom for 13 years. My mom was 75 much older than your mom but I took care of her from age 25-38. After my dad passed away I was her caregiver.   Listen sweetie. I said the same things as you about how I would never put her in a nursing home and how she didn't want to go anyway.   I miss my mom so much. I burst out crying yesterday because a memory came to me so vividly about her. But there is so much CLARITY now that she is gone. I love her to pieces but she would have been so much better off if at the age of 25 I put her in assistant living. Because at the time she was at least able to walk with a walker and in the beginning I only did things like laundry and cooking and standby assistance for showers. Gradually she got worse took a few falls messed up her back. Became bedridden during the last 6 years of her life.   I was her ONLY caregiver. She did have CNAs coming to bathe her 3 times a week which was helpful but even with that it was a burden. (Ask the doctor to order you this if she has Medicare she should be able to get CNAs to come bathe her). My mom was a fiery woman used to be very independent and always got her way. Very sweet though. She wasn't horrible I'm just saying she was a woman that knew what she wanted. It was... HARD. My brothers off in other states with their family. We had no family here. It was just me. I managed bills her pills her dressing Hoyer Lifts taking her to doctors appointments her dentures her voiding and bowel movements. The whole nine.   I still sometimes here a sound (probably my neighbors) that makes me think its her and I have an urge to jump up and run to see if she needs help. The PTSD-like crap will get to you. I don't even know if it's PTSD. It's something.   Look. I joined a gym and MADE time for myself when I was taking care of my mom. You have to. You HAVE to go on a walk or do yoga. You matter too.   But anyway.... I was saying before... that I have such clarity now. I would have done everything differently. And one thing that I learned... no matter how much your mom says she doesn't want to go to a nursing home the fact is she's just scared. Deep down any sensible human would choose a nursing home over putting burden on someone they love. But she isn't sensible. She's knocking pills out of your hand and she has had strokes. She's sick. So she can't think logically about the matter but you can.   You'd be able to visit your mom in a nursing home even take her out shopping or out to lunch sometimes come by and visit her and tell her about a new guy or job in your life. About your new yoga class. Have photos for her to look at. Grandkids for her to visit with. All these things I wish I could have done with my mom but can't because I never gave myself a life.
