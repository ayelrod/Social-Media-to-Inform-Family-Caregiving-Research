Not this grey winter that never ends and snow that goes into April. I'm starting to feel like I don't have anything left and I don't want to try anymore. I don't want to listen to my mother talking for hours anymore I don't have the energy to work through all of her problems or issues anymore. I don't even know to where to start I just want to sleep or stay in my room all day because it's the only place I get some silence.I had some energy when I got up today but she started talking and talking and talking and I could feel it all getting sucked away. Do people ever think that if you try to have a 'serious conversation' every single day with someone then after 5 or 10 years you are going to give it as much attention? The biggest part of taking care isn't managing her physical needs it's her emotional ones. Every interaction she has with another person has to be analyzed. She thinks most people don't like her or are out to get her. She monologues about her childhood every day. She likes to tell me what I'm doing wrong or that I'm not really talking with her so this must mean I'm not a Christian. She has debilitating bouts of depression that make her irritable and negative. I ask her to be quiet for a while and she just keeps on talking. If I go somewhere without her she acts depressed or like I'm going somewhere to talk about her.I want things to be easier and happier. My entire life has been spent around people who blow up when they are mad hold onto the past and can't forgive and let go. I feel like she's trying to make me angry or get some sort of response out of me. I did stop confiding her a long time ago because when she gets mad she'd say anything to try to hurt you. I don't want to argue or try to explain anything and I dont to be 'talked at' for hours every day either.

{"post_id": "474034", "title": "Where would you run away to?", "body": "EmotionallyNumb  Why do you tolerate any of this? There is no reason for you to. No one has to sit and talk to someone all day long. If you don't want to talk to her walk away and ignore her. This is what I do every day. You mother very likely is trying to get you angry to get a response from you. This is called instigating. Seniors do it all the time because many are bored and want someone to fight with. My mother used to instigate all the time. She doesn't so much anymore. Know why? I tell her plainly to stop instigating and to find someone else to pick a fight with. Then I walk away and ignore her. I don't confide anything in my mother either because I know she'll use it against me if she's mad over something. I learned not to confide in her from about the age of 10 or so.  Let me tell you one thing. It's not going to get easier or happier. You have to take some happiness for yourself. You don't have to live your mother's life. Nor do you have to tolerate her emotional abuse. You say you've spend your whole life around people who blow up when mad hold onto the past and can't forgive or let go. That's their problem not yours. If you want respect you have demand it and fight for it. You can't let people walk all over you even when it's family. Especially when it's family. You are not responsible to fulfill your mother's emotional and social needs. Your whole life doesn't have to be about her. Start going out. Take a class. Join a club. Take the vacation you're talking about.  As for where I would run away to. Where I always run away to. Scotland. God willing I'll be heading there in July.

{"post_id": "474034", "title": "Where would you run away to?", "body": "I have 1 daughter &amp; 1 step daughter who could both chew the ear off a brass monkey. I can't tolerate it really. When my DD was a child she didn't say a word until she was 3. The family (on my ex's side) were all so worried OMG there was something WRONG with her they'd say over and over again. I knew otherwise. When she turned 3 she started talking in sentences and hasn't shut up since; she's now 29. As a child I'd tell her 'I need 5 minutes of silence now dear.' That was the rule; we'd start out with 5 minutes of silence and work our way up to 10 and 15 from there. It was while driving I'd ask for the silence b/c it'd drive me up the WALL to hear her constant chatter while trying to focus on the road!   My step daughter now calls my husband and literally keeps him on the phone for 2 hours or more; I have no idea how he does it. It takes her longer to TELL a story than it took for the incident to HAPPEN!   So you want peace I understand that intimately. What I do not understand is why you are living with your mother who drives you insane? A child there's no choice about a mother there is. Using the \"you must not be a Christian b/c you're not doing things MY way\" BS against you is hitting below the belt. Having dramatic mood swings run-on monologues and the need to micro-analyze every personal interaction she has sounds like mental illness to me. Not to mention 'debilitating bouts of depression' and non-stop chatter. My mother was like this to a large degree which was one of the many reasons I could NEVER live with her again after childhood. Once was more than enough. She too could not have a moments silence while together; I believe she couldn't stand her own company and had to fill every moment with idle chatter just so there WASN'T a moment to THINK or to feel alone. That's my 2 cent psychology on the matter. My mother's mental illness was apparent since I was a very young child; I even kept a black &amp; white marble notebook about her 'episodes' so that I could present it to the 'men in the white coats' when they came to take her away so they'd have some history to go on. That never happened. Untreated/undiagnosed mental illness takes a huge toll on everyone but mostly on YOU the recipient of all of her wrath suspicions histrionics and runaway thoughts she can't seem to stop ruminating on.  You need a break. Yes it would be great to run away to some tropical island but that's not reality just a nice fantasy. Why not focus on what you can actually DO to get mom out of your living space NOW? Who cares if you send her off to the sibling &amp; they have a fight? Welcome to YOUR LIFE! Look into Assisted Living or Independent Senior Living or just an apartment for her OUT of your house (or you moving out of her house; whatever your living arrangement is). Other alternatives ARE available even if you think they're not. They are. Medicaid is available to finance Skilled Nursing if she qualifies. Section 8 housing is available even if it means you get her on a list now for sometime down the road. Even just getting the ball in motion can relieve your MIND of some of the burden it's hanging onto.   I don't have all the answers I just want to make you think about finding some yourself. Living like this with THIS type of mother invading your peace 24/7 is a terrible burden to bear. It has nothing to do with 'love' but with peace and with blessed silence that you deserve to have in your life. We all do. It's a human right I think that we take for granted until someone steps in and takes it away from us. Then we realize just how sacred it was!  Wishing you some joy &amp; peace in your life my friend and hoping you can find it somehow.", "date": "2022-04-06 14:34:50", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/where-would-you-run-away-to-474034.htm"},

It's like she has no awareness that I'm trying to do something else and cannot or do not want to listen to her at the moment. I've asked her how other people asked her quit talking in a way that did not hurt her feelings or what I should say when I need silence and her answer was 'I don't know but I know they were able to do it'. I don't have any respite providers my only sibling that lives in town hasn't talked to her or me in about a year. I'm almost too nervous to send her to my other sibling's house because I think she may end up saying or doing something that would cause a fight. She doesn't really have any tact or buildup in arguments she will say whatever comes to her mind and goes from 0 to 60 in about 3 seconds.  Yesterday was actually an ok day once I got home from work. It's just that I never know what I'm walking into she could be severely depressed from something she saw on the news she might be angry about something she could be just fine she could be ruminating on something from the past. She brings up the past so much I know just about all the stories by heart. She asks me what I'm going to do after she's dead and I feel like it's a trick question. Like she wants to know so she can pick it apart.

{"post_id": "474037", "title": "Medicare keeps taking money from my social security check.", "body": "On 8/28/2017 I was bitten by a neighbor's dog. The bite didn\u2019t require stitches so I went to my doctor on 8/29 to just get it checked out. That was the only visit and treatment I ever received for the dog bite. Since I had Medicare that was who the doctor's office charged for the visit. My daughter had a lawyer on retainer and suggested I file a claim. The lawyer was able to get a judgement for me and retained $235.00 for Medicare. The money sat in the account for several years. I called and asked had it been taken care of and was told after several calls that they would call me when things were settled. Fast forward I start receiving threatening letters from Medicare saying I owe them over $3000.00. With an attachment of over 20 pages of charges they said are related to the dog bite. The charges included knee surgery visits to a Dr. I see monthly and had been seeing since before the dog bite. I call my lawyer and leave a message that it\u2019s been way over 3 years since this happened and he needs to get his behind in gear and take care of this. His reply was a letter saying that he was no longer my attorney and that he took my suggestion as a threat and was going to call the sheriff on me. He still has the $235.00 in addition to the percentage he collected. Then Medicare comes for me telling me that I owe this $3000+ and they are going to be taking 15% of my social security check and charging interest as well. I called TOP Coast Professionals (who make the debt calls) and told them that there was ONLY 1 visit related to the bite. She told me I could send a copy of the billing for the bite and they could get the record adjusted. I got that called to say I was sending it she then said that I would also have to get letters from all the other 70+ service providers saying they hadn\u2019t treated me for the dog bite. I spoke with a gentleman named Ken at another number I called who agreed with me saying that my real financial liability was only $90.00. He was at NGHP. But that I would have to talk to Coast Professionals. He said I should get my money back but he couldn\u2019t say when that might be. I don\u2019t know the motivation of the person making out the report for me that day. They had the ICD codes they knew what was what. But here I sit having sold my jewelry just trying to pay my bills. I don\u2019t have much left to sell my wedding ring and engagement ring are gone. I have a few gold chains left. I\u2019m afraid to pawn my car. I couldn\u2019t pay it back and I\u2019d lose my car too. I don\u2019t know if you can help me but maybe the people who are reading this will be forewarned to just pay the bill don\u2019t wait for Medicare to call one day. The biggest thing in all of this is why that person at Medicare put together a recovery summary they knew was wrong and I\u2019m afraid of when the bills come and I don\u2019t have anything left to sell.", "date": "2022-04-02 20:34:34", "user_name": "Toodistressed", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Financial Planning", "Medicare", "Paying for Care"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/medicare-keeps-taking-money-from-my-social-security-check-474037.htm"},

Don't worry too much about what is going on in this world. God will take care of HIS own.  God will always give His children strength to endure through and overcome whatever HE puts in front of them.  Remember pray often and Jesus loves you and so do I.

You are the only one you can change. I found I had to increase emotional and physical distance to decrease the harm to me. Less contact stronger boundaries maintaining the consequences of breached boundaries.   It's very difficult for a person who has been abused in any way as a child to caregive the abuser(s). Don't underestimate that or your need for distance from the abuse or your need for distance and time and support to heal.", "date": "2022-04-02 21:47:44", "user_name": "golden23", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/general-topics-213495.htm"},

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge.

I need to scream.  (I\u2019m very calm friendly when I speak to her).   My mother has been abusive to me my whole life. And like many adult children suddenly we\u2019re helping our abusive parent.  This will go on for years.   It\u2019s destroying my mind (stress). And I can\u2019t work properly because after helping her I have to recover from the abuse.  I know many people are in exactly the same situation as me.  She\u2019ll continue forever.  She treats my brother very well. He does nothing to help. I know it\u2019s a common scenario.  All of us with good hearts wanting to be kind to our parents (even when they\u2019re abusive)\u2026  I need to find a way to stop being attacked.

I was able to get back home from my job in late January just in time to close on two houses move and see her get a second round of septic shock. She was also bleeding internally somewhere but couldn\u2019t withstand the tests necessary to figure it out. I had her HCPOA and we decided that her DNR would be engaged. She went to hospice on a Tuesday and my sister finally decided to put in an appearance on Thursday. She passed very peacefully on that Friday evening. The hospice and hospital were top notch. Very helpful with hard decisions and her comfort. My sister stuck around long enough to grab some jewelry and high tailed it home before any hard work could begin. It was a long few months but in the end she went to be with my dad like she wanted and I really felt we all (hubby and I) did the best we could.

It is Feast: True Love in and out of the Kitchen. I just finished Jamie Raskin's book Unthinkable about January 6th and about the suicide of his son. Highly recommend. A wonderful man who tries hard to see both sides. And what an education: For instance at 80 I never knew that until 1913 it was our Congress who elected our Senators not \"we the people\". Most profound from him is this quote which shows how differently we think in our country how divided we are: \"As the senaors exit and the House members resume their usual places I look to my left and see the Democrats and to my right I see the Republicans. I recall a conversations I have with a Republican colleague Rep. Clay Higgins of LA. once when we were sitting on the floor. 'What do you see when you look out over our side and then over your side'? I asked Clay who is a good- natured man with an awesome Cajun accent. \"He looked at me and said 'you tell me first'. 'When I look at our side' I said 'I see America today in all its glory; black white hispanic asian-American LGBTQ straight gay women men immigrants native-born. And when I look at your side I see America in the 50s.' (Clay replied) 'When I look at your side he said I see the Coasts New York and California. When I look at my side I see the heartland'. End of quote from this book. Really if we could just think and talk to the \"other side\" how much we could learn about the differences we all feel see believe. And how much more alike we might admit to be in our thinking than the rhetoric we are forced into when forced to \"choose\" those sides?

As a mother she has dominated every aspect of her children's life.", "body": "First rule is protect yourself. You are no good to anyone in this world if she destroys you and your joy.  It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him. Quite to the contrary the more I loved him the worse he treated me. I was trained by my mother who was very similar to him so my whole life I have been destroyed by jealous people. The more they tortured me the more I needs validation so I threw myself into my work and my hobbies. As a result I became more successful which only made things worse. I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave. I filed for divorce because he is going to keep caregivers refuses to go to Assisted Living until he uses up all his savings. At that point I realize his wife (me) would have to pay his expenses thus using up all my savings leaving me with nothing for when I can no longer care for myself. My kids see only the fake dad the perfect one making me look like the evil person. I have lost them we still see each other but it is very strained. My advice to you go no contact. She will destroy you. You deserve better. You will feel the weight is lifted off of you. Don't feel guilty. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about. Send cards and call. Don't go.

{"post_id": "470787", "title": "Wonderful trick to remotely reset cordless phone of parent who doesn't press OFF button", "body": "Both my aging mother and mother in law have cordless phones and often forget to press the OFF button when ending a phone call. This means that they can no longer be reached by phone the calls immediately go to voice mail. In the past the fix was for me to drive across town to reset their phone. I've now figured out a great solution to the problem that allows their phones to be reset remotely either across town or across the country.I don't know if this will work on all phones but it does work on more than one version of Panasonic cordless phones. To test if it will work on your phone end a phone call without pressing OFF this will put the phone in the unreachable state. Then unplug the base station phone from power and after a few seconds plug it back in again. If this resets all the phone to working order then this solution will work for you.Knowing that the power reset fixes the problem I realized there was a good solution. The solution is to plug the base station power into a smart plug. The smart plug that I had available was one from tp-link while at my mother's house I used her wifi (yes your parent will need to have a wifi connection) to configure the smart plug. I set up a dedicated account that I log into using the Kasa app from my phone and from there it is very easy to turn the smart plug (and the phone plugged into it) off and then back on again. So now when I notice my mother's phone is unreachable I log into the app and and reset her phone while sitting on my sofa at home. The Kasa app login can also be used by my sisters if they notice the problem before me.The app could also be programmed to reset the phone every night when your mother is sleeping (if configured in this way the reset would happen regardless of the state of the phone) so that her phone will be available to callers in the morning.I don't know if anyone else has this problem but both my mother's have the problem so I think it's probably pretty common and the fix is so good that I wanted to share it.", "date": "2021-10-24 18:28:30", "user_name": "JorgeVerde", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Long-distance Caregiving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/wonderful-trick-to-remotely-reset-cordless-phone-of-parent-who-doesnt-press-off-button-470787.htm"},

Drop her a** off at a hospital ER and tell them you're done and can't do it anymore. Or pack her bags and pick a sibling. Then leave her and her belongings on their doorstep. Ring the bell once and drive away. I see some of the stories on this forum and I say OMG! big-time. I'm able to be a caregiver to my mother. We have been able to come to an amicable arrangement that is beneficial to us both because she knows I'd do exactly one of those two things.  I don't play any games. I don't tolerate a moment of stubbornness or instigating or gaslighting or guilt-tripping or passive/aggressive nonsense. I won't have any drama or 'performances' to get attention or to sabotage a special occasion. I do right by her but it's on my terms not hers. She also knows that if dementia shows up to the party I will stop being her caregiver. My sister does not help out but she's least decent and has some respect. I wish you all the best and hope you find a different arrangement for your mother soon.", "date": "2022-04-02 23:38:42", "user_name": "BurntCaregiver", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm"},

The antipsychotic helped her a great deal. She also needed an antidepressant.

Wondering why they were like this was a waste of time and energy for me. It is what it is. After mother died and the estate was settled I cut contact with my sib. It was the right move for me. I'm not saying any of this was easy. It wasn't but I learned to deal with it.   glad -happy for you that the job is going so well so far. I read your other posts about your AirBnB. Yikes!!!

It must have been nice being home in your own bed for a little time.   sharyn - not nice that Nancy is very ill and also has an abusive sibling. Nancy has to put herself first and let others deal with her sister. That may mean having little contact. Nancy sounds like she was a lovely friend to your mother. I am sorry she is facing this. You say you are feeling low and down on yourself. Please give yourself a pat on the back for being a great help to your mother when she was going through dementia and also for being a great grandma to your grand-twins and a great mother to your children. Do something good for you -something that will pep you up. Hope senior kitty is still doing well.  I'm still working on treatments for the CFS. I definitely need more energy. MCT oil (bullet proof coffee) seems to help. It's early to say that this is reliable in an ongoing sense but every bit helps!!!

There s no doubt that my quality of life has improved despite other difficult things that have arisen. My dd is recovering from her second chemo and doing well. The next one will see her half way through the chemo. She's not worried about the surgery at all which is good. After that comes the radiation.

Which I did.    it\u2019s so sad this woman was very helpful when my mom had gotten distrustful with my sister and me. She worked my mother. She helped with my mothers financial issues which my mom did not trust us.   she told me today that her sister has dementia she lives in Utah. This friend of my mothers live in California where I lived. A family member had her placed in a faculty which she escaped from and ended up in Wyoming.   this friend of my mothers (name is Nancy) Nancy is dying from cancer and can\u2019t go to Utah to help. This family member in Utah did get POA. How can they help her when she is difficult and combative?   I suggested they find a doctor or neurologist who specializes in dementia get her on an anti depressant even if it is capsule that they can open to put in her food or something like a juice. Find a facility that has a security system where they use a security bracelet on her sister so if she tries to leave the bracelet will set off alarms.

Nancy says she can\u2019t talk with her sister because she gets difficult accusing them of taking her money and home from her.

That\u2019s not my personal email though it\u2019s a company email.  I thought The whole point of this forum was how coming from dysfunctional families can add weight to caregiving. My only purpose of sharing something either from my own personal experience website or information I know of that was to share something supportive of caregivers.   Because of my knowledge and experience of the many issues and daily challenges of caregivers especially individuals working 24/7 without a support system my purpose is to help outside siblings to see that their daily challenges is everyone\u2019s problem and crisis in the family. This is especially true if the person is a sick parent with adult children.   We hear a lot about caregiving burnout and how this can take a physical and emotional toll on the caregivers health but unless you are the sibling working without support you may not be aware of what they go through.   I\u2019ve seen videos and information a wealth of information that shows if that Main Family Caregivers health breakdown then the family could have two sick people needing help the caregiver and the person needing care and the burden of responsibility could fall on another sibling unexpectedly.   I know of a personal experience where this happened in a family that did not communicate like they should with each other about their mothers health with dementia. One weekend out of no where that sibling decided to take Momma to visit another sibling for the weekend with the intention of leaving her. This is exactly what they did and overnight that siblings life and household changed.   This is why for families that can put aside any differences when a love one needs total care if they can have a plan of action in place and learn how to work together it can take some of the load off of just one individual and the burden of responsibility does not have to be placed abruptly on another sibling.   When a medical situation happens that forces a family member to need total care many families are at a lost of what to do. This only adds to an already dysfunctional family. How nice it is if people are aware that there may be other options task and responsibilities each member can take on.

What I do when I visit my mother who lives in Memory Care &amp; has advanced dementia is I bring distractions to keep her OFF of the complaining subjects she likes to dwell on. I bring my dog who likes to sit on her lap and I bring my cell phone which is filled with videos and photos of her great-grandson which she likes to look at. Even the ones she's seen before and has forgotten about. I'll even pull up photos on Facebook of her nieces and nephews if I run out of other things to keep her occupied. I also bring snacks which she likes a lot so that's another thing to keep her occupied for a short while.   Find uplifting things to talk about and do rather than depressing things that add to her already funky mood that's my suggestion. It's not easy having dementia and living in Memory Care with other elders suffering from dementia that's a fact! As hard as it is for us to go there to visit them *and it IS HARD I acknowledge that* at least WE get to go back to our own homes when the visit is over with. I honestly dread going to the MC to see my mother each &amp; every time b/c I never know WHAT I'll find when I see her so it's always stressful and sad for me. But I'm glad I do go b/c she is always happy to see me and I feel like I've done a good thing by going.   Hopefully you'll take some of these tips and make your visits a bit more pleasant for both you and your mom in the future.", "date": "2021-12-13 18:25:58", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/another-visit-gone-south-471635.htm"},

Basically you're telling her she should do the same stop inconveniencing everyone and die.  Oof.  I suggest what the others have said and not go down that path. Just because you were able to talk to your mom in a certain way once upon a time doesn't mean you really can now. She's in a scary and precarious place in her life these days and some reassurance that everything's going to be OK (whether it is or not) is more useful than being told that she's not handling her own decline the way you say you would from your vantage point of several decades away from that point in your life.", "date": "2021-12-13 18:07:21", "user_name": "MJ1929", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/another-visit-gone-south-471635.htm"},

{"post_id": "471635", "title": "Another visit gone south!", "body": "Mom's cover story of feeling miserable because she does not see family enough is common. But I also think it is incorrect. There are many people who hardly ever see their family or have no family at all &amp; yet they are happy. They find 'family' where they are.   I think what she means is she is lonely. Is not feeling connected to people around her. It's understandable.   I imagine making connections gets harder as we age especially when you add in hearing loss others people's quirks &amp; impairments too.   But talking about lack of family visits is a little close to a blame game imho. If only family came I would be happier.. so my unhappiness could be their fault...  The bottom line is Mom's happiness is her own responsibility (not her family's). Her happiness is actually based on her own thoughts.  The good news is she CAN change her thoughts (sometimes a Geri-Psychologist &amp;/or mood meds can assist with this).

I also think it's unreasonable that MIL/FIL believe that it's ok to pay some family members for care while expecting others (SO) to do such care free of charge.  Does your SO know how angry this makes you? If not you really need to have a serious discussion about it and what this entire scenario is doing to your mental health. He can tell his parents \"no sorry I'm not willing to give up my few precious days off. You'll have to hire an aide to come in on my SIL's days off\".   If he is unwilling to do that for whatever his reasons then you're going to have to make some tough decisions...stay with him and put up with this highly dysfunctional family or decide enough's enough and end the relationship. Neither choice is a good one I realize. But you can't force people to change; you can only change yourself.

The same thing happened one week later and then his Mom informed him that Brother's Wife had told her that he would be available for the day he semi-had off as well. SO chose to confront his mom about this and say he needed his weekends too. Brother's Wife chose to counter by arranging a spontaneous \"Christmas Dinner\" that she tried to get us to come to. SO just said we had prior plans to go out. This dinner btw was in early October and said sister had been here a full month LIVING WITH THEM. Certainly she had enough time during her free Saturdays and Sundays plus all evenings to socialize with this sister but instead chose to disregard that SO has a very difficult less lucrative highly physical job.  He set that boundary. Like his parents he shares almost a phobia about seeing them naked let alone handling private parts.  BW doesn't have to really handle any actual ADLs but the time is coming. It could be here next month if certain treatment is ordered. I would call agencies myself and clarify what respite/advance ADL care is needed but MIL says she doesn't want anyone but DIL and aide in there so I'm respecting that.

She's always \"I can take care of people NO PROBLEM.\" But there is in that there is no care plan for two things in particular.  1) Respite beyond her Sat/Sun weekend. Hubs only has one day off really as he has to actually go to work to submit paperwork on the other day. She has a full weekend already that she won't swap out with the indy because...well...she and Brother need their weekends. And so do we. If there's an emergency of course but otherwise she needs to swap hours with the other aide for time off or duh bring in a third aide. That would be a plan.  2) ADL losses are already apparent. They could seriously be exacerbated by a) the three general-anesthesia surgeries FIL is planning to undergo in the coming months expressly including toileting and bathing. b) MIL's probable third line cancer treatment which carry an actually higher risk.

I had an aunt in Assisted Living and the staff had planned parties etc... Let her find some friends or companions to keep her company. Send her cards and letters to brighten her day (without you being present). That will alleviate your guilt.  I've always heard that an empty glass can't pour water. Give your self rest know that you mother has to receive what good people give her and she doesn't. That's on her.  You are my age and we were raised to love everybody and turn the other cheek. A careful study of the scriptures showed me this (through a good friend). If being around her causes you to sin then you have to guard your heart. God tells us if something makes us weak then to avoid it and in that way keep peace. Send sweet cards call now and then and hang up.  For me I will never forgetthe day I hung up with my stepmother (like your mom - she used to write me long letters telling me what a rotton mother I was) and I was crying or agitated. My husband noticed. I told him I love her but I refuse to let her control me anymore. I forgive her (which releases me) but that doesn't mean I have to be responsible for making her happy.

I am 68 years old. Try as I might to let the things she does and says just roll off I can't. It feels like being tortured and put to death by a thousand pin pricks. She is narcissistic and manipulative. She never acknowledges that things she says can be hurtful to others - she says they are too sensitive. I have tried to express my feelings to her but have learned it does no good so I just clam up and stop talking to her. Sadly I don't enjoy her company so work at distancing myself from her mentally emotionally and spiritually. It feels like the only way to save myself but fear I may become an empty shell.  As a young girl I was not necesarily close to her - I now am getting a clearer picture of why.  You are not a selfish person. The feelings we have towards our mothers are not comfortable so I think we try to push them down because they make us feel guilty and selfish. I was once told that guilt is resentment turned inward. There may be some truth to that.  Do what you can to be true to yourself. Do what you can to have whatever relationship with your mother that works for you. One of my worries is that when mom is gone I will feel guilty for any unkind ways I treated her. I want to be able to look myself in the mirror and know I did the best I could in a very difficult situation.  Take care and know you are not alone. There are many of us in the same boat.

My dad has always been a loner (not particularly family oriented) controlling critical and demanding. He went into a rehab facility that is about 20 min away from me after his amputation and I have decided to transition him to the nursing home side of the facility. He now calls and emails me constantly to come and get him out of there. He says he feels anxious when I'm not around and he wants home cooked meals and to stay at my house. At first I jumped at every call because I feel guilty not having him here. But I started to just get more resentful and exhausted and my kids and work had to take a backseat to his needs. I was visiting every weekend and/or bringing him to my house every weekend. But now I don't jump every time he calls and I go about every 2- weeks. I have constant guilt because I know it's not his fault that he has dementia and he feels frustrated to only have one leg. The guilt is always nagging away at me.

I am the only remaining child of parents who were abusive to both me and my now deceased older brother. I would recommend that you look at the work of Alice Miller The Body Never Forgets and The Drama of the Gifted Child--there are others titles too. Your depression may be caused by early memories and experiences and hurtfulness in growing up with an intolerable person. I have two parents who are 98 and 97 who live at home with a part-time caretaker. This holiday I am spending with loving and kind friends and family--I need a mental health break away from the toxicity of their home. You are not alone--put the guilt in a package place it on a boat and sail it down a river--say good-bye and fill your life with goodness and grace--don't allow her to cause further harm to you and your children. Step away and take a break--she will be fine without you--she can do so much harm to your physical and mental health--protect your life and your health. I am 65 and am determined to live a stress-free guilt-free happy life and wish the same for you--find the motivation and determination to make it happen. It's hard work but you can do it--set yourself free. Good Luck--", "date": "2021-11-22 22:41:17", "user_name": "meri155", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/elder-mom-is-miserable-nasty-hateful-person-145470.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

Here I sit over a year now and Im seeing all the things that got me where I am today. How the shudda woudda coulda- all rises to the top more damage done than even I expected- and I knew I was a friggin train wreck!   Shortly after she passed my husband took a stroke- vascular dementia- and I am struggling to be the best I can be for him; somedays I just cant take the drooling garbled words and I feel awful saying thing like-\" I missed that try again\" Im trying to maintain his dignity treat him as a respected husband still love him discuss things as husbands and wives do..... Im loosing it.  Sometimes I wonder if the mom issues just knocked the stuffin's out of me and I have less to work with for him like tolerance-the drooling sends me out of my mind. I know better and I cant seem to work past it.   Ok so those are todays issues but for you that are still dealing with mom or dad....please dont wait til their death put an end to this. If you carried what I carried Im suggesting you start now- the healing process- have something left over either for you or whatever else get brought your way.  She used to refer to me as the \"Blood clot that learned to walk and talk\". Or\" the worst miscarriage she ever had-she survived\". All those little terms of hers are silent now but not in my head. Still can hear them still remember when and where she would toss out those phrases.....and on days Im sinking caring for my husband.....here they come again..... Dont wait for the parents to pass-dont let their labels become who you are as I did. Cuz in my situation now granted Im not called a little b**** stupid b**** Gods garbage 24/7 like before yet when I cant seem to help my husband all that is loud and clear.   I will say this for the first time publicly-here and now- I am 64 yrs old and I have no true sense of who I am. Nothing. I live from sun up to sun down nothing in between. Im realizing now how over the years and demands became constant coudnt tell you the last movie I went to last time I danced used to decorate for holidays bake crochet curled my hair or put on make up- my nails are now short and unpolished refinished a piece of furniture....its all gone. As the years got worse I dropped pieces of me all over the roads traveled and today....there is nothing left to give up. Covid took the job-stroke took my husband; both I loved A LOT! Only time I leave the house is grocery's or doctor appointments.  Please read this and understand it doesnt end with the person ripping you up passing away. Get out now while you can any way you can for as long as you can.

But when I was left with total care of my Mom and the responsibility of POA I pushed that guilt aside. I needed to make decisions in the interest if me and Mom. I found in the 20 months she lived with me I was not a Caregiver. The unpredictability of the disease was one thing. I like organization and at 65 hard to change that. And doing the intimate things for her bothered me. I was going to place her a week in an AL to go to a nieces wedding. Turned out they were having a half price sale on room and board so I jumped on it. Eventually it was LTC. By that time her care went beyond what I was physically capable of doing. Yes there maybe some things I could maybe feel guilty about but I refuse to. Because good or bad I was the one that was there for her.   So if you feel you can't do it don't.

She lived in a very nice senior community (but alas did not have MC/NH). This was my break from life in America and connect with my schoolmates even take small tourist trips to explore parts of India with mom's home as a base.Mom became very forgetful &amp; there was no one in India to supervise her care with aides. The aides would show up late &amp; leave early etc &amp; her care became a nightmare . So I just moved mom over here and we will probably sell her house in the senior community. My inlaws my extended family are here husband &amp; kids have no interest in India.The point of all this is: I so miss visiting India - I spent the first part of my life there. I was 24 yrs when I came to America. It kills me to see other families planning summer trips there talking about ticket prices etc. I just cannot believe that there's no need for me to go there anymore. I could visit and stay in hotels - when covid is under control -- but it will never be the same as staying with one's family waving to the milkman talking to the newspaper guy in our language and the million little things that'd part of the daily life if only mom was there! It breaks my heart to stay in my country as a tourist.(I'm connected to the Indian community here in my town and attend cultural programs &amp; festivals but it can never makeup the thrill of \"flying home\" for summer and going back to your roots.)I'm so angry and in shock that mom's dementia has robbed me of a very cherished experience. I'm also an empty nester now and feeling every loss very acutely.Even if covid subsides mom is quite frail now and I doubt she can tolerate the plane journey to India and stay in her senior community like old times.Thank you for letting me ramble on and vent....I'm very grateful that mom is safe with me we have our health &amp; home etc..but some days these thoughts are not comforting enough.", "date": "2021-12-13 15:29:30", "user_name": "wearynow", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Mental Health", "Travel"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/i-feel-i-have-lost-so-much-with-moms-dementia-i-miss-my-home-country-471717.htm"},

I think a lot of older books where the protagonist was a child or the setting was fantasy vs real life were/are still labelled as for children simply because of that and the author never set out to write a children's book. I'll never understand people giving little kids TLOTR and even The Hobbit is a stretch for an early reader. I can remember having Heidi on my bookshelf as a child and never being able to get through it and I was a voracious reader even then. One I reread a few years ago was The Secret Garden that is a wonderful story!   I'm coming back to add - one of my pet peeves is that I think giving kids books that are beyond their reading ability and/or with themes beyond their comprehension ruins the story for them especially if they have access to a film version and skip the reading altogether.

No family should ever have to make it their life's work to stay on top of everything in the care facility or hospital their loved one is in every moment of the day. Sadly we do have to because that's pretty much the healthcare system for the elderly and family has to do the advocating on behalf of their own. There has never been a nurse social worker or other healthcare professional who has ever gotten away with rolling an eye placating or making a snotty retort to me. When dealing with these people you can't get mad and lose your temper. I never do. I will have straight answers though.

I couldn't tell you how many countless elders I've said this to. That they're not a burden because they need help around the house or with personal care or running errands like shopping or a doctor's appointment.  The \"burden\" is the narcissism. It's the assuming that the family will simply be \"voluntold\" that they are the old-age care plan. It's the expectation that family will simply accept their new life in nanny-slavery with joy in their hearts and smiles on their faces. It's the instigating and trouble making for sport. It's the endless complaining. It's the stubbornness that often crosses over to dangerous absurdity. It's the orneriness over nothing and the \"performances\" (such things as a totally unnecessary trip to the ER because to make sure you miss out on something you've been looking forward to). It's the sense of entitlement like the whole world owes them simply because they were lucky enough to not die young and were able to become elderly. It's the cheapness (even when they have money) and unwillingness to pay the actual price for what things cost. It's overdoing the neediness unnecessarily. Everyone here knows what I mean. So many seniors like children will behave as if they are incapable of the slightest independence and can't do anything for themselves. Not because they actually are but because they want to be catered to and waited upon by acting like helpless infants. Then they resent it when people treat them like helpless infants. When this behavior doesn't achieve the desired outcome they evolve to being a \"senior brat\" and a whole new kind of attention-seeking tantrums start up.

This is what the \"Oh it's MY fault blah blah blah\" is all about she is counting on the family to reinforce that she's valued by placing a higher burden on them. If she were able to do this in the first place you'd expect her to be on her own hands and knees or at least attempting to instead of going to the instant emotional whine about how SHE needed to be validated right then.  Second at least one and possibly more than one of the theypresent children--all but the minor--might not be home for anything but the holidays. A couple of them I believe were Ivy-league educated (i.e. Columbia or \"Hudson U\" as it was referred to so presumably they'd be the most apt to move on with their own lives as their peers presumably have. The dad is supposed to be this big undercover cop and the story would realistically collapse if he could not fulfill this role and realistically his kids should not be expected to help with grandma now that mom is dead.  It could be an interesting story arc to see how this unfolds but we all know what happens.  Grandma Bernie should never have been taken in as that will potentially force at least one of the grandkids--whose decision it wasn't--to do what Dad can't do given Dad's schedule.

Aside from unforeseen unavoidable and \"bad luck\" events in some people's lives a main reason why receiving and giving care becomes a burden is because people are in denial and they don't plan and save. There are other factors like the cost of medical care and people who choose unhealthy habits but mostly many people just don't plan early enough.  My mom (the daughter of immigrants) was a single parent the entire time she was raising me (an RN who worked FT). She never received a penny of child support. YET she went on to own her own home (a humble home later in life and paid cash for it) owns her car has no other debt and lives comfortably on her savings. Because of clean living and the luck of the draw she is a very healthy 92-yr old. She has good financial means right now but if she has a profound medical issue she will burn through her savings pretty fast. Most people's life savings are used up in the last 18 months of their lives. At some point if she requires Medicaid so be it. This is what it's for (also funded by taxes).   Creating an adult care tax credit will require management by the government. Our large and inefficient government. Everyone else's taxes will go up to fund yet another program. IMO we should be lobbying for more transparency in medical and care costs so that there is accountability and we can vote with our wallets.

It is COLD!!! So I have 7 goat babies. Sarah had her two on the 25th of Jan. A boy and a Girl Jada and Job. Rebecca had hers on the 26th two girls and a boy Zeeb Mary and Rhoda. Abigail had hers on the 28th two sweet girls Chloe and Phoebe. All Bible names. :) I had to help Rebecca and Abigail Deliver they had some issues. It was the most amazing scary exciting and beautiful thing I have ever gotten to do. It was Awesome to say the least. Sarah had no issues and actually kidded in between my 30 minute checks on them. It was quick for her. I stayed with Abigail all night before she delivered because I knew it was anytime and her being a first timer I wanted to make sure I was there if she had trouble which she did. In a few weeks we will be milking. We had to sell the 2 wethers. DH decided no males if we are going to have dairy goats. Because we rent a buck as needed. I did not want to sell them because they were sweethearts but they went to good homes. Now we are going to have some issues because Job has become special to me he is a sweetheart and I don't know if I will be able to sell him. I would like to keep him and breed him to the girls minus his mother and sister of course. But anyway we will see.  Lesson learned I will never again breed my does to kid in the middle of winter.   I have been staying tired with all thats going on and just don't seem to find and \"free\" time to do the things I wish to do.  So please keep me in your prayers this has been an especially hard winter.  you all are in my prayers and I hope everyone is doing ok.   I am hoping one day to be a regular again.

I hope you all have a better Year than the last. I have missed you all dearly.  My does are due to kid any day now. I have been studying up on being a goat midwife :) My plate has been super full for a while now which is why I have not been able to visit here like I want. But I think of you all often and keep you in my prayers. I was studying Acts 27 this week and I found in it some things I never really thought about before and I have read that chapter many times over. Just thought I would share my thoughts on some of the verses. This is when Paul was set sail to Rome.  7-11 This part of the sailing was getting dangerous due to the winds and the like. Paul attempts to warn the people of the danger but rather than listen to a man of God they listened to their human wisdom. This reminds me of Ezekiel 33 when God said if the watchman warn the people of danger and they do not listen then it is on them. Well such is the case here. This verse is similar to Christian lives if we warn people of the danger of living without Jesus and they do not listen then it is on them. But if we do no warn them it may very well be on us. But like today\u2019s culture man\u2019s wisdom trumps God\u2019s wisdom unfortunately. 12-20 After being warned by Paul and not heeding the warning the ship and passengers underwent severe troubles. And in verse 20 when it says that no stars or sun appeared in many days and they were pretty much hopeless that would be an extremely difficult part of the journey. As in life when we go through trials and we feel all hope is lost because we cannot see the rainbow because of the storm it is hard. But here comes faith in the next verses. 21-26 After a period of silence Paul speaks up. He encourages the men that everything will be ok that their lives will be spared. Paul never lost faith in God and God\u2019s plan for him. As a child of God we can have that hope \u201cand know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to HIS purpose\u201d Romans 8:28. Paul knew even before this journey set sail that he would get to Rome because that is where God wanted him to go. These passages are such a good example of life. In our journey we have hard and perilous times yet our faith in God and knowing HE is working on our behalf will bring us to the other side where HE wants us to be.

I'm so glad you've read the book and found it as life-changing as I did. It actually helped me to put it into \"action\" while in an extremely toxic relationship with my half-sister who I never lived with and was 15 years older than myself. I terminated the relationship however when she was dying I did go to see her at my ex-BIL's and my mom's request. Nothing changed on her part with that visit. The day she was dying my mom aged 82 who had fallen and fractured her right wrist (driving hand) two days prior called me that morning and asked if I would drive her to the hospital which was an hour away. There was no way I would ever ever deprive my mom of seeing her daughter in spite of my own situation. We went and spent the day leaving at 4 p.m. As soon as we got back to my mom's house we received the call that my half sister had passed away.  What I liked about the book was it was extremely well written and interesting plus it had real life examples (although names were changed) and the chapters were broken down into the different relationship types it applied to once you read the introduction and first chapter. This makes it very easy to go back at any time and as you said \"re-read parts to refresh\" yourself.  Having worked in a mainstream church from 1993-1998 it's very easy to see how Christians can and do use \"guilt\" and other manipulative tactics all under the guise of Christianity. There is no harm in having the ability to use the word \"no\" when it protects yourself and the limits you want to set. In fact you absolutely should. Working on staff was where I actually learned \"how to say no.\" Even better is when you can say \"no\" without even having to give all kinds of reasons and explanations but that may take some time for some people to get to that point. I make the choice whether I want to explain my \"no\" further or not.  Whether or not your BIL and sister would intentionally do it or not only you would probably know the real answer to that since I don't know the background but I can tell you sometimes it's disguised really well and you have to be really in tune to the them. It could be that they're used to you being a \"go along with things\" type and therefore they can't imagine you not doing something they've requested from you. I think the main clue/answer is in your line about their lack of curiosity as to what plans you have and why - that to me is very telling and shows their motive.

Neurologist started the wheels in motion for him to begin Onpattro I fusions. Working with a case worker from the drug manufacturer and the infusion center where he will receive treatments we found ou that 80% of the treatment costs will becovered by Medicare. Our supplemental insurance will cover the remaining 20%. There was a slight delay in the approval process. Those of you living outside of the U.S. most likely will shake your heads in disbelief but in the United States our health insurance payment system is totally dependent upon codes that insurance companies assign to various procedures and treatments. Hospitals and clinics may also use codes...but they are usually internal to their operations and differ from those of the insurance companies. And then there is the added complication that hospitals clinics and treatment centers may have separate agreements with insurance companies that place them in selective discount tiers that allow them to adjust payment fees for differing institutions. When a doctor writes an order for a treatment they must be sure to specify the appropriate billing code used by whatever insurance company covers the patient. Many people are employed to keep track of all of this. In our case the neurologist correctly identified the appropriate billing code on the initial order. We were told however that a subsequent note that was sent to the infusion center contained a different code. With all the hands that touch the communications it took a while to identify who had seen the first code who had seen the conflicting codes who needed to contact the neurologist to make the correction and then find out where in the process the first information needed to be canceled so the correct code was used. (Yes we definitely need to overhaul our healthcare system.) Husband will receive his first Onpattro infusion today. We also were referred to a cardiologist to determine if husband's heart is involved. We met with cardiologist last week. We found that in Colorado where we live there are not many doctors with experience diagnosing or treating amyloidosis. This cardiologist referred by our primary care physician has some training both from his residency and a short internship with an amyloidosis specialist. Because husband already had the genetic confirmation of the Val30Met gene mutation the cardiologist limited his initial visit to an EKG and vitals. He advised the test that would reveal cardiac amyloid deposition is a PYP scan. A radioactive injection that when exposed to another scan causes amyloid deposits to glow thus confirming presence in the heart. This test is scheduled for early January.  mMeanwhile my husband's symptoms have worsened. His weakness and fatigue keep him chair-bound and napping throughout the day. If he does something like taking out the trash his breathing is labored and he must rest afterward..When he eats he feels full very quickly. He is eating barely half of what he was two months ago And continues to lose weight. In the past two days he has noticed considerable loss of strength in his left leg from his knee to his foot. He fell the day before yesterday after trying to bend forward to pick up something. He was not injured. But he did reveal that this was not the first time he has fallen. (News to me.) The falls the weakness the reduction in eating all tell me that disease is progressing rapidly. The infusion can't come soon enough.  I will share how the infusion goes and how he tolerates the treatment.

I wish that I would have discovered that sooner in my caregiving journey. It would have been better for my mother and myself. Caregiving is such an emotional experience.  It\u2019s so very hard. While I am glad that mom is at peace now and I know that she is with my father in heaven. I find myself missing her terribly. My mom had a beautiful smile. Even during the final month of her life her smile lit up the room.   I am convinced that her faith is what kept her spirit up. She loved Jesus Mary Joseph and all of the angels and saints. Her favorite saint was St. Jude.", "date": "2021-08-04 16:32:28", "user_name": "NeedHelpWithMom", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/news-from-italy-465683.htm"},

The ER doc took her off of it because her pressure was too low. She also mentioned to us that patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease tend to run lower blood pressure.   Mom felt awful when her pressure was low. Too high or too low is bad.   If she doesn\u2019t drink a lot try fruit jello yogurt lots of ice in juice. If she sips slowly the ice is melting and she\u2019s consuming more water. Personally I eat soup year round. Some people only like it in the winter. My mom went to the bathroom so much that she didn\u2019t want to drink a lot but they get dehydrated. I made smoothies for her with fruit yogurt and ice.

A couple of weeks in she approached the administrator shopping list in hand and asked for directions to the grocery store.

Eight hours later and well after dark (she hasn't driven after dark in years) the police were just about to put a vulnerable adult alert out on Twitter with photos of her and the car. My husband was on the phone with adult child #2 filling him in (we didn't want him to find out when his friends said hey isn't that your grandma on Twitter?) when her residence called to say she had breezed back in thanks to a Good Samaritan who had guided her back from the grocery store. Where else she had been she can't say.  The next day I \"stole\" her car. It is in the garage in her house which she still owns. She asks after it wonders why I took it why I hate her etc. I've ordered the police report so with any luck seeing it in black and white will convince her it actually happened.", "date": "2021-12-09 09:18:26", "user_name": "Ambrianne", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/are-you-on-the-naughty-list-471582.htm"},

Add to that I'm really sick of being a caregiver already and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week came home for a week went in for another week and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her and I feel bad about it. I apologized but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same.  I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot. I'm tired of being trapped in this house not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion. I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984 she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so.  The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings at home with me.  So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt crippling anger and overwhelming stress. I'm trying to not feel like the worst daughter in the world.", "date": "2021-11-16 01:50:22", "user_name": "Rosewater", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Burnout", "Family Caregiver", "New to Caregiving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-new-to-caregiving-and-trying-not-to-drown-in-it-471198.htm"},

You are the only one you can change. I found I had to increase emotional and physical distance to decrease the harm to me.

My Mom has dementia and requires almost full time care but I have my brother who always helps out and is very cognizant of what my Mom needs. What you are doing is just. too. much. for. one. person. My Aunt is my support person (she lives in Florida) took care of her husband until she had to place him in nursing home. He died from Alz and diabetes. While he was in the NH she went at lunch time to make sure he ate and then at dinner time. She never missed a day. She also went to support groups and learned a lot. She tells me every time I talk with her - Number One: Never feel bad or guilty about losing your patience or temper or what you say or yell. Number Two: You are doing the hardest job in the world. Number Three: You are doing more than what most people would do. Number Four: No one else has ANY idea how hard it is - unless they have done it too. I really know how you feel about taking care of your Mom and not putting her in a nursing home but you really do need to think/consider about prioritizing some of your needs ahead of hers - such as working and having enough to live on and for retirement.

If this is what you want make this known from the beginning with the agency. We have 3 times per week aide the same one every time for 3 hours a day. She mops the high use areas cleans the bathroom heats the food and makes sandwiches for supper washes the dishes and does the laundry takes out trash and provides them with some outside company and conversation. It is working out very well. She will go buy groceries if needed or pick up take away food too. The cost is less than $30/hr and if your mother has funds it is money well spent. You have to be involved at first. I was in the home when they started I wrote out check lists bought the cleaning supplies and stocked the bathroom and kitchen etc. But once you get a reliable aide with common sense and some experience after a couple of weeks of check lists its smooth sailing. I would Highly recommend them. But do be there when the aides first start coming so you can show them what is expected where things are and give them the low down on the parent - the good the bad and what you really need and expect. So they are not doing things you dont value and you are not always looking over their shoulder. Every day won't be perfect a couple times I found the trash was not taken out or the cat box was not scooped but 90% of the time its been great. We had only one who just came in sat on the sofa and played on her phone while my dad watched TV and talked to himself. (I walked in on this) But she was just a fill in for one day. The regular aides have been great and if/when they can't show the agency calls me direct and they will staff it with someone if at all possible. And as needs increase we can increase the coverage so they can stay in their home as long as possible. And if the aide cancels or quits the agency finds a replacement to staff your needs.

They are another one loaded with great recourses.  After that may I suggest you contact the local Alzheimer's society. There are another one which will offer great help.  The one bonus for you is you do not have free loading relatives which makes the job all the more difficult.   Oh and as for the emotional hell you are going through may I suggest you go to the best councilor there is. His name is Jesus Christ. He is just a prayer away.

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge.

You can\u2019t fix the problems that have resulted from her poor judgment and lack of care for her health.   Consider the big picture. Your finances will be a wreck if you\u2019re not working. You can\u2019t keep this up. Your mental and physical health will really suffer. Her care will become more demanding and you simply won\u2019t be able to keep up with it. What would happen to her if you became too ill to take care of her?   Contact your Area Agency on Aging. They will have a lot of options and ideas about caring for your mom including how to get in home care for her. Red tape in applying for Social Security etc simply is and you can\u2019t escape it. Once it\u2019s done life will be better. It\u2019s overwhelming because it\u2019s crazy making and you\u2019re drowning in so many other tasks and emotions as a caregiver for someone who is angry and difficult.   Never say never about a nursing home. Don\u2019t bring it up at this point. If it comes to it search through Medicare website to find the very best one you can. Visit her a lot. When a facility knows family comes a lot and is involved the care can be better because they know there\u2019s another set of eyes on the loved one.   If you don\u2019t have it already do get Power of Attorney. Your life will be so much easier.

I'm 39 and like you I was extremely overwhelmed in the beginning of my caregiving journey. My mom passed last month and the finality of her being gone is a tough adjustment; but I would have continued my sacrifice just to have her here. I don't know if you believe in something higher than yourself but I advise that you pray and turn to the word whenever you are feeling stressed resentful angry etc etc. I also advise trying to seek counseling/therapy to help with coping mechanisms while this journey lasts. I had no counsel in the beginning and I was my only help. I cared for my mom from roughly 18-39 years of age and that story in itself is something made for a movie which I won't divulge right now as I'm trying to be brief. In addition to what most of your supporters have mentioned regarding seeking someone to give u a break every week or so if it's financially possible or applying for Medicaid so she can have home health aides with her during the day while you tend to your needs you must also focus on your health and well being. We are consumed when caring for our loved ones that we tend to neglect ourselves. I have had way too much experience with hospitals rehab facilities etc etc. The healthcare system is broken and changes must be made. If your parent requires 24/7 care and help the countless facilities I have experienced will cause a decline in their health. Thank God for his blessings over my strength and patience as I was there from sun up to sundown once I realized the care given is not present so I was pretty much an unpaid worker whenever she was hospitalized or in a facility. Places lack the number of staff needed to help and nurses are overwhelmed with too many patients and when you witness this for over 2 decades it's heartbreaking and the quality of care is nonexistent. If ever you need to talk about the nitty gritty when it pertains to ALL THINGS related to caregiving please reach out. I tended to all my mom's countless needs and as time progressed more issues arose so I was in charge of medication administration feeding tube care tracheostomy care you name it....I was even taught how to give her antibiotics via her pic line at home. I have learned so much that I would not mind sharing with you or anyone else for that matter. Please pray and try your best to love her through her illness.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "What a great thread. This has been a very valuable discussion for me as I'm sure for the original poster. My Mom is turning the corner on being 88 and just beginning to exhibit some memory issues and has incontinence issues. She's in excellent health otherwise. I've gotten her health POA and permissions to discuss her care with her GP Medicare etc. She agreed to do this so that I wouldn't have to deal with all that should she get sick. She lives by herself in a house built by her and my Dad. I moved long distance to live near her 6 years ago when my Dad passed away. My husband and I do lots of little things for her and we're happy to do it however she's beginning to let the house fall into disrepair. I had to have a talk with her to let her know that if she wanted to stay in her house she would need to get things fixed. She is financially well off so money is not the issue. I think she gets overwhelmed when there are too many things to take care of so she just ignores some things. I found a handyman to begin repairing and replacing some of the important things like getting one of her door locks replaced because it was broken. She reasons things away like this by saying she lives in a gated community and no one would be able to get in. Ugh! Her front door locks were oxidized and the key would no longer work so those are being replaced too. When I tried recently to get her to have other things fixed she said it was too much too fast. Big argument there so I let it go. I'm going to try again after Thanksgiving. Her memory issues worsened over the summer. It comes and goes. We live in an area where people live here 6 months out of the year (we call them snowbirds). Her friends are returning and she's as happy as a clam. She's been hacked three times and I worry that it's only a matter of time before it happens again and harm is done. (thankfully I caught all three in progress and averted the worst).  Problems with long and\u00a0short-term memory:\u00a0 1. forgetting that's she's already asked the a\u00a0question just\u00a05 minutes later repeats herself. Seems to come and go.\u00a0 2.Often reintroduces me to those I've known for several years. 3.Showed up a day early to pick up friends for dinner another day an hour early.\u00a0 4. Forgets that she's ordered something online or orders an excess of items.  5. Has several piles of mail around the house.  6. Can't keep up with her emails (I have access to that and clean out the spam for her)  7. It's hard for her to make phone calls for\u00a0things that need\u00a0taken care of or fixed. Gets confused as to who's who with vendors. 8. She has items that should have been returned a year ago sitting on her desk.  The list goes on and on. I try hard to help her with all of it but she's resistant and stubborn. The caregiving has barely begun and I'm already frustrated and angry. Thank you all for the advice!

She was 85 yrs old when she came here to live in a home just 2 doors away from me. She just gave me the power to take over all her finances and keep the orderly running of her home. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. She was up and down in her health and my life became doctor visits taking her out to places she would enjoy and food shopping for her. I lost my own life completely. If the electric went out during a storm I worried. If we had a blizzard and couldn\u2019t get out I worried. Every minute of every day was thinking about her her bills that needed to be paid her medication refills her congestive heart failure problems her growing breast cancer her taking a shower just everything that a person needs in order to live comfortably. She was able to do so because I gave up everything for her. And I did resent her. She would not have done that for me. Now that she is passed - at age 95 (this past summer) I feel relieved but I am still stuck. I urge you to think about a facility that can care for her at her level of care. This is a situation that will eat you alive. I developed Non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 5 yrs into my caretaking and I know it was due to stress the first years of caring for her. I am still treating. I don\u2019t know how long I have as I am stage 3b and there are only 4 stages. My body could not take the stress of actually taking over someone else\u2019s life. I kept a diary of sorts for the first few years and when I read back on it I don\u2019t know how I did it. It was a terrible time for me. My mother had it good but I did not. Please consider doing the next best thing and do not feel guilty. You deserve your life and she will have hers. She may not like it in the beginning but don\u2019t let that sway you. You will be fine and she will even have friends meals showers etc. in her new home. And you can visit her and be her daughter again. Do it.

They can offer medications that ameliorate many of the behaviors you describe. The behaviors you describe are intolerable for anyone - it is not a case of your lack of patience or love.  You are finding this hard because it is the hardest job anyone will ever do. Medicare should cover an aid 3 times a week to help with bathing and dressing.

As a mother she has dominated every aspect of her children's life.", "body": "First rule is protect yourself. You are no good to anyone in this world if she destroys you and your joy.  It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him. Quite to the contrary the more I loved him the worse he treated me. I was trained by my mother who was very similar to him so my whole life I have been destroyed by jealous people. The more they tortured me the more I needs validation so I threw myself into my work and my hobbies. As a result I became more successful which only made things worse. I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave. I filed for divorce because he is going to keep caregivers refuses to go to Assisted Living until he uses up all his savings. At that point I realize his wife (me) would have to pay his expenses thus using up all my savings leaving me with nothing for when I can no longer care for myself. My kids see only the fake dad the perfect one making me look like the evil person. I have lost them we still see each other but it is very strained. My advice to you go no contact. She will destroy you. You deserve better. You will feel the weight is lifted off of you. Don't feel guilty. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about. Send cards and call. Don't go. It is easy to hang up (for the doorbell or any other excuse) and cards are no contact. Take care of YOU. Someone told me this is your only life it is not a dress rehearsal. That is very profound.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Might I make a few observations and suggestions.  1 - Your mom's care will be overwhelming if you are the only person caring for her 24/7/365. Burnout is inevitable if you do not get enough \"time off\" to meet your own health needs and social needs.  2 - While I admire your dedication to your mom and her care you are neglecting your own retirement. You need to secure your own financial state first and being with mom second. Nobody can secure your finances or retirement but you.  3 - Everything seems overwhelming. You need to sort out the issues and create a plan. Meeting with a social worker and a counsellor - even televideo meetings can help. The social worker can help you locate and access all the resources available for your situation. A counsellor can help you sort out the emotional overload and create a healthy plan for dealing with your mom.  4 - There are lots of ways that you can work get enough time off and help care for mom. You can not care for her 24/7/365 alone.   a - Ask for help from family friends community of faith and paid help. Some folks will be OK with sitting your mom for a few hours weekly. Others may be able to help with household tasks: housekeeping meals yardwork running errands...  b - if you can not get enough help to care for mom at home then it is time to look at outside resources. Adult Day Care is a Monday through Friday daytime option; they care for mom in a nursing home of private home while you work. Home health aides can also watch mom in your home while you work. Assisted living usually consists of having a private room or suite with home health aides that assist throughout the day. Full care is for those that need frequent care by others. Check to see if mom's insurance and finances will cover any of these services.   c - If mom doesn't have enough finances help her apply for Medicaid. Help her also apply for Medicare and any other public help. You can make an appointment with Social Service. It might help to review their websites and gather all documents needed. If your mom ends up in the hospital again ask social services to help you with these tasks.   d - If mom needs to use Medicaid for help she may be best served in a residential facility that takes Medicaid clients.   A good daughter or son makes sure that their parents are cared for... even if it means you can not do the hands-on care yourself.", "date": "2021-11-18 09:56:23", "user_name": "Taarna", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-new-to-caregiving-and-trying-not-to-drown-in-it-471198.htm"},
{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Oh goodness. I saw this in my email inbox and I knew that I had to come by and say something. My mom passed away last year. I am 39 years old. And I took care of my mom for 13 years. My mom was 75 much older than your mom but I took care of her from age 25-38. After my dad passed away I was her caregiver.   Listen sweetie. I said the same things as you about how I would never put her in a nursing home and how she didn't want to go anyway.   I miss my mom so much. I burst out crying yesterday because a memory came to me so vividly about her. But there is so much CLARITY now that she is gone. I love her to pieces but she would have been so much better off if at the age of 25 I put her in assistant living. Because at the time she was at least able to walk with a walker and in the beginning I only did things like laundry and cooking and standby assistance for showers. Gradually she got worse took a few falls messed up her back. Became bedridden during the last 6 years of her life.   I was her ONLY caregiver. She did have CNAs coming to bathe her 3 times a week which was helpful but even with that it was a burden. (Ask the doctor to order you this if she has Medicare she should be able to get CNAs to come bathe her). My mom was a fiery woman used to be very independent and always got her way. Very sweet though. She wasn't horrible I'm just saying she was a woman that knew what she wanted. It was... HARD. My brothers off in other states with their family. We had no family here. It was just me. I managed bills her pills her dressing Hoyer Lifts taking her to doctors appointments her dentures her voiding and bowel movements. The whole nine.   I still sometimes here a sound (probably my neighbors) that makes me think its her and I have an urge to jump up and run to see if she needs help. The PTSD-like crap will get to you. I don't even know if it's PTSD. It's something.   Look. I joined a gym and MADE time for myself when I was taking care of my mom. You have to. You HAVE to go on a walk or do yoga. You matter too.   But anyway.... I was saying before... that I have such clarity now. I would have done everything differently. And one thing that I learned... no matter how much your mom says she doesn't want to go to a nursing home the fact is she's just scared. Deep down any sensible human would choose a nursing home over putting burden on someone they love. But she isn't sensible. She's knocking pills out of your hand and she has had strokes. She's sick. So she can't think logically about the matter but you can.   You'd be able to visit your mom in a nursing home even take her out shopping or out to lunch sometimes come by and visit her and tell her about a new guy or job in your life. About your new yoga class. Have photos for her to look at. Grandkids for her to visit with. All these things I wish I could have done with my mom but can't because I never gave myself a life.

I have a guy who will rope the moon if I asked and does everything in the world to make me happy.And in some important ways I can\u2019t imagine anyone unluckier than me.I don\u2019t know how I ended up 49yo unable to work earlier because of two autistic kids and then after a good career now unable to work because of two 80 yo parents who decided they\u2019d like to fill the shoes my kids left empty except they\u2019re not my kids and they\u2019re not cute.Between ten specialists for dad and three for mom breaking up their fights nonstop both physical and verbal driving around hunting down an old man who keeps taking off after fights expecting I\u2019ll find him and neither of them understanding a thing doctors tell them so I have to drive them to every appointment and be there for EVERYTHING\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m going to die soon if I continue doing this.Just 2.5 years ago I moved them to me in NV from CA because my dad was on oxygen 24 hours per day and admitted to the hospital constantly due to CHF \u2014 a condition he\u2019d apparently had for ten years except he didn\u2019t understand when he was diagnosed so I didn\u2019t know for ten years until I finally went to a cardiology appointment with him. I visited often enough when I lived 7-8 hours away but only for a few days at a time because it\u2019s draining being around their fighting. I didn\u2019t even realize the depth of how he had deteriorated mentally as well.In one month I sold off their lives and listed their house and moved them closer to me because I KNEW my dad was going to die and if that happened my mom would likely dig in and refuse to move.I got them their new place found every reputable specialist in NV including getting him into the Cleveland Clinic for his neurological issues and began to manage his plethora of fatal health problems and managed their entire lives.And he got better. He got better and didn\u2019t die because Mom and I dedicated everything to getting him better despite the odds and he lived. The better he got the worse he became as a person. At least if he couldn\u2019t breathe well \u2014 he was in bed and quiet.The level of energy these two have to battle it out is unbelievable. Without going into detail I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s bad. And somewhere along the way in the last two decades these two feel they need to tell me every detail of how awful the other one is. In the last two years it\u2019s almost like they tell me just to see if I\u2019ll side with the one doing the tattling. (And in 99% of the case it\u2019s my dad who is completely wrong and beyond reasoning but only he doesn\u2019t see it.)I do more than enough.Every single thing they need I have to find and make happen. I read every one of their mail and every time my dad decides he found a better deal for his insurance or a car loan or a mortgage I\u2019m the one who has to clean it up. Their cell phones act up - call me. Their TVs don\u2019t work - call me. iPads die \u2014 call me. Got a phone call \u2014 tell the caller to call me. Drug store claims some drug isn\u2019t available \u2014 \u201ccall my daughter.\u201d It\u2019s me for everything except grocery shopping.This isn\u2019t a life.

I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I ended up having two stents put in due to 100% blockage and have been diagnosed with diabetes.Tonight I was just screaming and screaming at my dad after having found him walking the streets going nowhere after they duked it out when I was called to find him \u2014 and felt like something burst in my head and for a couple of hours the eyesight in my right eye had a white flash in it. I\u2019m OK now but can\u2019t catch my breath.I am falling apart and at this rate they will outlive me. I never agreed to give them my whole life.

When I was in my mid-40s their relationship significantly deteriorated and I had to constantly be the referee. It was a horrible position to be in. I swear I still have PTSD from the constant odd phone calls drama falls fights 911 calls. It went on for years. In my case my mom was the aggressor and my dad was beginning cognitive decline. There was also prescription drug abuse and alcohol use (not a good mix for 70 year olds). Anyway I eventually had to place my dad in memory care for his own safety. Mom refused to consider any other option (such as in-home care). It was chaos. I am an only child and there was no one else to step in. I thought my life was over.  I do believe placing my dad in memory care probably caused him to die earlier than he would have. To me the blame is on my mom for that. He died in 2019 after 3 years in the facility. Now I am stuck with her but through some good fortune I was able to get the house sold in 2020 and because of her alcohol relapses she ended up in ER/hospital/skilled nursing/assisted living. Unfortunately the physical &amp; occupational therapists have spent all of 2021 bringing her from wheelchair to rigid walker to rollator and now a cane. Last year at this time she was in a wheelchair in memory care babbling nonsense and now she is walking and wanting to live independently again.  I am not sure me or my marriage will survive another miraculous recovery on her part. I will be 55 in February. I have been stepping in and dealing with their sh*t since 2009.  I agree parents are absolutely not supposed to be like this. I never imagined either one of my parents would end up living a decade or possibly two in such a state. A middle-aged person should not have to sacrifice health career marriage happiness for unending years. This is not the way it was supposed to be. It's not like caring for a child.

As someone who is in a similar circumstance my first thought is to take care of your own health first. Immediately actually. I'm concerned about your eyes. Hire whatever help they need now so you can focus on yourself. Then when you're feeling better you can sit down and make a plan on how to best move forward.   I don't know your situation but things didn't improve for me until I told my siblings that I quit. We started working together as a family after that meltdown. It's amazing what can be accomplished if you have help and support from family. If not hire the help and support.  During a discussion we had with an elder care attorney she told us about someone she had on staff. I can't remember the woman's title but the employee would go into the home and evaluate the loved one and then make recommendations for care. She was like a geriatric social worker.   My husband and I have been held hostage for so many years I'm embarrassed to say because neither of us had the gumption to stand up for ourselves. As a result we've been caregivers for the three parents between us without help from family. Now I say \"Two down one to go.\" Dark humor forgive me. We've learned a lot in the past year and are doing much better but we still have challenging days.   Isthisrealyreal wrote \"Not being snarky you have been conditioned so thoroughly by your parents you actually believe that them getting what they want is more important then you.\" It took me so long just to understand this concept.

Identifying the problem is the first and a big step. I am still a work in progress.  On the dd front good news. The chemo is working even after only one session. The lump is already smaller. She has her second session next week with some small alterations in dose to reduce the D and better meds so we are hopeful that she will not repeat what happened before.   I had a meltdown today - just too much going on. DD asked me to drive her next week to two appointments one at 9:30 and the other at 11 the next day. As much as I want to do everything I can to help her I have my limitations -particularly my age the CFS/FM and the fact that I am moving house in a few months and am downsizing and preparing to sell. Also the fact that since her diagnosis I have less support than usual and am being asked to give more than usual doesn't help either. I wish I could do whatever she needs me to I wish I could take this all away I wish I felt better and able to do more but I can't and I don't. I am coming out of a relapse and mornings are not my thing anyway. I called her and she understands and says whatever she asks is always framed with what I feel I can do and \"No I can't\" is fine but my mother's heart wants to do it and feels bad when I can't.

Neither you or your mother will win a argument when trying to reason with someone with dementia. His ability to reason is long gone as is the executive ability required to manage his life. Some of what is occurring is because he is no longer mentally competent to initiate actions or control himself. Given the constant fighting and the post-fight wandering your dad might need to be in a memory care or even a nursing home given his overall poor health.

Recovery from caregiving is still important in my daily life. I tend to isolate a lot and Covid really helped do that very effectively.

That is the passive aggressive ways of my origin family.  TS1 sent a packet yes a packet on bullying to several family members including to my mom's husband. I was caring for him and mom for four years he had general decline but still very sharp. Mom lost in the depths of dementia. TS1 was angry because I was there helping them and thought it was a result of my bullying them that I was there. Twisteds really preferred their denial at that point and thought there were no dementia problems there and TS1 never visited or assisted. She lives about 5 miles away. She was afraid of me verbally assaulting her the therapist!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  TS2 sent letters to professionals that my mom had hired over the years. The list included the CPA attorneys doctors etc. She was wanting to verify the extent of the dementia whether mom needed care what was appropriate care and the value of home care all the while telling these people what mistakes as she judged I had made in my life including my first marriage 35 years earlier even some things that went back to high school. I found out about the TS2 letter because mom's husband showed it to me. He was hurt and astounded by the accusations made against me. He and I were very close.  The TS2 letter sent to the pros was given to me by mom's husband again after it was given to him by their CPA. Again the hurt for him. I scanned and sent that to TS2 and she was angry that someone had given it to me. Of course I did not tell her where it came from.  Just a sampling of the craziness of my two twisted sisters. I haven't talked with TS1 the therapist in about five years now.  I should have posted this to the dysfunctional family thread.

And it cost $1200 to fix the garage door.  They won\u2019t touch him because of the massive health problems\u2014at least not without significant bloodshed. The only thing they\u2019ll do is throw him in an ambulance to be held at a hospital on a psych hold because he went nuts on the cops \u2014 and then I\u2019m called to take him back home. I tried to get him admitted to the psych ward officially \u2014 and the social worker agreed \u2014 but the doctor said it wasn\u2019t warranted because he\u2019s calm now.  It was literally better if the police hadn\u2019t been called because then I had to bring home an enraged man back to the same house and either leave my mom there with him stay there myself to ensure her safety or bring her to my home.  I suppose I could not have picked him up and left him there. I freely admit: I don\u2019t know how to do something like that to my own father. I didn\u2019t speak to him on the way home or for a week after until he apologized but clearly there were no lessons learned be it from the police or from how I handled it. Could I have ignored him for longer? Sure \u2014 but to what end? So he won\u2019t go to the appointments I worked my butt off to get for him and we miss something and he dies?   This level of care is why we\u2019ve discovered a subdural hematoma; a GIST tumor in his stomach that we had removed; a gall bladder mass that ended up being gall bladder cancer (also removed); a blockage in his carotid artery that now requires a vascular surgeon because an angioplasty was impossible; a mini stroke recently that now requires more neurology visits and that\u2019s in addition to his CHF vascular dementia stage 3 kidney disease COPD and more. It\u2019s really hard for me to treat him normally when he is clearly not \u201cnormal\u201d not that he was ever a \u201cnice guy\u201d before these problems.

Doing everything for them is not a big issue for me though sometimes I find it irritating.   There are two distinct parts I just cannot stand.  (1) It\u2019s the dynamics of their awful angry relationship that affects me. It\u2019s just unbelievable to me that at 80 years of life with death up right ahead knowing one of them may not wake up tomorrow and that would not be surprising \u2014 this is how they want to spend what could be their last day of life. How sad for them\u2026and how pitiful for me to watch it firsthand.  (2) My dad is just mentally unfit. He\u2019s a well-educated MBA man who worked to the high ranks at a US conglomerate before retiring and he\u2019s deteriorated to making no sense and can\u2019t process what he hears be it in English or Korean. Can\u2019t hear that well and what he does hear he can\u2019t process. (They\u2019re concluding its vascular dementia but specifically not Alzheimer\u2019s which has been ruled out.) And everyone can see it EXCEPT HIM. He\u2019ll still actually tell me he knows better or he doesn\u2019t need the likes of me etc. unaware he can\u2019t do anything for himself.  Worse he creates more work for me having to undo these ridiculous scams he falls for \u2014 Cheaper Medicare! Better refinancing rates! Save money with solar! Free HBO! \u2014 and so forth. All the calls and paperwork I have to do for them doesn\u2019t anger me but when he MAKES trouble\u2026 I just get enraged. And he\u2019s not even apologetic; he says \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Call and cancel it and stop acting like you\u2019re doing something extraordinary!\u201d  Everything else meh \u2014 I\u2019ll live. I make all the food they love and have them over or deliver it and go out to dinner with them every week. I take them out to social activities they like and my husband is a good sport about going with us. When they have to drive a ways to meet friends and it\u2019s nighttime we drive them there and find something to do for five hours so they can have fun. They need only get dressed and wait for me on the days we have appointments and attend; they don\u2019t need to listen to one thing the doctors say or follow up with a single item \u2014 I do it all. Literally all they have to do is not create chaos and I\u2019m willing to go to the ends of the earth to make their last years easy for them but it\u2019s like they\u2019re hellbent on sending me off first!

I moved them here because it was clear they couldn\u2019t manage their care anymore. Be it a sick dad or sick mom I can\u2019t live with the fact that either died without my having done all I could.   Contrary to what I make it sound like in my original post (1) they were not bad parents to me growing up all things considered; and (2) I actually don\u2019t regret moving them here to manage their care. Even doing everything for them is not altogether torture for me in that giving them a few full-time years of my life to ensure a comfortable ending is still worthwhile to me. I\u2019m lucky to be able to do that. I know that.  It\u2019s that they hate each other and live off this drama that kills me. It\u2019s that they have zero qualms about involving me in this drama of theirs letting \u2014 no demanding and forcing \u2014 their daughter witness the ugliness and misery they cause each other at the end of their lives that just\u2026rots me. It\u2019s truly like a black mold that just spreads and I hate it. That is what I feel \u201cparents\u201d shouldn\u2019t do. I hate that my parents do this and I hate that I let it get this close to us.   I have asked and begged to be left out of it. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care that my dad took off again or that they had a blowout fight but I do not want to be involved in that part. I don\u2019t want to know and if they can\u2019t handle their own tempers to ensure they live peacefully they should deal with the repercussions of that on their own too. I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m savage and callous - but they don\u2019t understand I really cannot operate like this.  I\u2019ve explained that my life and my relationship with my husband are so peaceful and zen BY CHOICE and that I can\u2019t deal with the constant animosity they bring into it.

And when his family is around he treats you like a nobody. That is just so wrong on so many levels.  You're obviously used to him not putting you first and that should be the BIGGEST red flag ever. I find it amazing that your marriage has lasted this long.  In a healthy marriage the spouse should be the number one priority above any children or other family members. PERIOD.  The fact that you're not his tells me that you have a lot more issues going on than just perhaps parents moving in. Please reevaluate what's going on in your marriage and seek out some marriage and individual counseling so you can better understand why you put up with not being his number one priority.

{"post_id": "473280", "title": "Dreading when parents move in.", "body": "Good Morning  I grew up in an intergenerational living household. One of four kids stay-at-home Mom Nana lived in an in-law apartment. After Nana's house was sold a small in-law (bedroom/sitting area/full-bath) separate entrance with a patio was built onto our home. Saved a lot of running around for my Mother who would visit \"Nana\" in her house on a daily basis. The small pension wasn't enough to survive and a decision needed to be made.   Absolutely loved my Nana living with us. We were jumping with joy when she moved in. Every night my Nana would sit with my sister the youngest and review her spelling words.   Caregiving is nothing new. Years ago the word \"Assisted Living\" even the word \"Caregiving\" was unheard of. We called it \"taking people in\". Could be Auntie So and So who broke her hip and needed some convalescent. Prior to the apartment the family room would be turned into a makeshift bedroom (a/k/a sleeping on the sofa) the other Nana is coming to live for a while until she decides what she wants to do since Grandpa died. My family has seen it all.  There 's going to be pros and cons. Nana who lived with us paid board--small amount. Mom cooked all the meals but Nana had her own phone tv and bathroom. After supper Nana would retire to her apartment watch the news and settle in for the evening. The added \"board\" gave us some nice \"extras\". For us it was a win-win situation. I never felt alone always had a group around the table and always felt I had someone to talk to. My cousins Aunts and Uncles always visited because Nana lived with us. We were known as \"The Clan\".  My sister-in-law was not happy about \"The Clan\". She grew up having a 20 year span between her only elder sister and herself. So when she was born her sister was already out of the house and married. My brother was forced to make a choice it's me or them she told him. She did not want both but could have. The problems that have stemmed from that were isolation of their children from family events babysitters that were picked out of the newspaper and very low attendance at any of their family celebrations--Communions Graduations Weddings Births. They have no relationship with 1st cousins the way I have and it's a total 360 from the way my brother was raised. Please don't do this to your husband he will get resentful as my brother is but it's cheaper to keep her.  I know it's different today with people \"needing their space\" but overall if you can put up with people's quirky ways I think at least in my home life it was well worth it. My mother was the eldest of 4 the only girl in an Irish family which also means you do everything as I do now for my mother and willingly. There was never a time in my mother's mind where she thought she wouldn't do this and I am of the same mold. I have never abandoned my post. My Mother was a young widow.  In all honesty I don't know of anyone at least in my social circle who can afford Assisted Living. It is extremely expensive to live in the Northeast. The senior housing list is a mile long. You could have a family meeting and set down some ground rules and change things as it goes along. I wouldn't exactly label it \"tell me what you don't like about me\" but more like--lights out at a certain time tv low in the evenings if they take their hearing aids out buy them a headset. A separate phone line is better and decide who takes the mail in etc.   My dad a wonderful man was also going to have his mother move in and add another apartment downstairs. The Mexicans have the right idea. They stick together. You see the children hanging out of the grocery cart with Nana helping out. This is how I was raised just like the Mexican families! \"A strand of (3) cannot be easily broken\". Everyone I knew and this was in the 1980's lived like this. This was my norm and I wouldn't trade it for the world! Amen...

A few nights later my other neighbor was kept awake by incessant coughing and hacking from next door. The next day he went to that neighbor's house and asked for a ride to the hospital.  No one was allowed to visit after that. The hospital only has that rule around Covid.  I can't say how much caregiver stress had to do with his demise but I didn't observe the masked desperation or isolation I've seen in so many caregivers. This was a social guy who'd ride his bike ran a doggy daycare in retirement and organizes neighborhood golf outings.  SO and I are boostered but in fact did test positive around the same time frame as our neighbor did. We had no symptoms and wouldn't have known had we not tested ahead of a family gathering his immunocompromised mom wanted.   Had this neighbor and us been socializing in one of our houses or at a restaurant I would be consumed with asking myself what if it were me who gave it to him? Ninety-eight of every 100 adults here are vaccinated--so most likely a vaccinated person gave it to him.  This is why it's hard to hang out with unvaccinated friends.  A bar or casino full of randos is one thing. There's less of a sense of responsibility.

If they guess incorrectly the flu vaccine will be effective albeit less so than the variant for which it was developed.   Deaths for India or Africa are poorly documented because testing isn't done with any real frequency so no one really knows how much the virus has affected the populations. They've reported about half a million deaths but in reality it's thought that they've had closer to three million. The same goes for their reported numbers of cases -- they're far far below reality. (All that information is easily found from reputable sources.)  Yes in the end it's a personal choice. What's unfortunate it the \"ain't no one going to tell me what to do\" attitude that so many use to defend a choice that can ultimately end in your own death. It makes absolutely no sense. If it only hurt the person with that attitude I'd have no problem with that Darwinian decision but so many children are being deprived of parents and grandparents long before their time should be up.

Basically someone has to step to the plate and assure the hospital/facility of a safe discharge. The PCP can write a script for VNA services. In my case I asked the doc to send in the troupes. By that I mean physical therapist occupational therapist nurse home blood draw etc. Whatever your dad's coverage offers.   I found the aluminum gray walkers given out upon discharge make the patient all hunched over eyes to the ground poor posture and breathing as well as sore wrists after a while. One the crutches etc. are put away I would check with p/t about an UpWalker Lite or something similar. You can check out Amazon but have a paper trail (scrip from the PCP) so insurance will cover this.  Everything needs to be modified (the dwelling) before discharge. Your dad is probably going to want a \"male\" wash him a CNA. A shower chair commode all of this is covered under the health insurance you must have a scrip so everything will be covered.  A hospital bed chosen by the p/t or PCP may be needed. Again should be covered by insurance--you need a paper trail. Make sure you have help in hand and that if for some reason brother doesn't keep his word (like in my case) you're not stuck without help. This does happen. Don't be shy and refuse any services that are offered by the insurance.   A lot of this caregiving is knowing the person well and learning along the way books this blog etc. You can put a camera on the door and a text will come up on your phone should something happen. Your phone/internet provider can install this for about $20 per month plus installation.   Shower bars can be installed again medical insurance should cover the bars.

It is Feast: True Love in and out of the Kitchen. I just finished Jamie Raskin's book Unthinkable about January 6th and about the suicide of his son. Highly recommend. A wonderful man who tries hard to see both sides. And what an education: For instance at 80 I never knew that until 1913 it was our Congress who elected our Senators not \"we the people\". Most profound from him is this quote which shows how differently we think in our country how divided we are: \"As the senaors exit and the House members resume their usual places I look to my left and see the Democrats and to my right I see the Republicans. I recall a conversations I have with a Republican colleague Rep. Clay Higgins of LA. once when we were sitting on the floor. 'What do you see when you look out over our side and then over your side'? I asked Clay who is a good- natured man with an awesome Cajun accent. \"He looked at me and said 'you tell me first'. 'When I look at our side' I said 'I see America today in all its glory; black white hispanic asian-American LGBTQ straight gay women men immigrants native-born. And when I look at your side I see America in the 50s.' (Clay replied) 'When I look at your side he said I see the Coasts New York and California. When I look at my side I see the heartland'. End of quote from this book. Really if we could just think and talk to the \"other side\" how much we could learn about the differences we all feel see believe.

He never examines me BEFORE exclaiming \"You have a viral infection.\" I advocated for myself finally he examines me after I asked him to and he reluctantly gives me a script for an antibiotic - with the instruction to wait a few days before getting it filled. (Yeah right!) After coming home and putting a compression head wrap on that did nothing to relieve the pain DH found a kind of ice pack that I will be putting on after eating dinner.", "date": "2022-04-04 00:43:12", "user_name": "Llamalover47", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/my-whine-moment-today-168013.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

{"post_id": "473093", "title": "Expectations of the \"institutions.\" The first question I was asked is if my dad can live with me.", "body": "They asked you the question. You have an aging Dad. Had you really never before thought of whether or not you could care for an elder in your home? If not then the time is here now.  So tomorrow bright and early you call the Nurse Manager and the Social Worker in charge of Dad's care. You tell her this:  \"Gee I am so sorry but I had never considered caring for my Dad in my home and on a phone call I got it kind of sprung on me and I answered yes. Now I need to tell you there are utterly NO CIRCUMSTANCES under which I could care for my Dad in his home. So now we need to get together on placing Dad for his own safety into in= facility rehab and then assess as we go as to whether Dad can go back home or must go to Assisted Living or some other level of care; I depend upon you to find the best placement you can during this discharge planning period. Sorry I misled you; Dad was always so vital and off skiing and I just never thought about this before.\" You can see it will do not good to tell US you can't do this. I couldn't either; not for a single second. You must tell THEM so they can begin planning for his rehab and deciding what level of care he needs. Now as to his care. Whatever insurance then assets your Dad has will go to pay his expenses for his care until those assets are gone. If he has a wife there will need to be division of their assets so that Dad will have his own portion to spend without robbing all of MOM'S money. If Dad owns a home the home will not have to be sold for his care unless that's how he wishes to do it (or his POA if he has dementia and has a POA). There will be \"clawback\" by the government to pay for Dad's care after his death should he need now to enter care ( when/if the home is sold.) That is to say the home will have a lien on it. Other than that the POA or the state if they have guardianship will apply for medicaid. The taxpayer will pay. Yes. That is what the taxpayer picks up the care costs for those who have run out of their own savings. As to what we pay taxes for???? I was an RN all my life and made quite good money and was proud and happy to pay my taxes. When I retired early at age 62 I began to collect Social Security. I am now 80. While I paid a whole lot of taxes guess what the Government in these last many many years has repaid me all of that and MORE. So figure it out. I am now using YOUR tax money as well.  My Dad has a saying about taxes and insurance. It was \"Let me pay a whole lot of taxes and let me get a whole lot of insurance and let me hope someone ELSE needs it and I stay healthy and without any monitary help for my needs\". I feel the same. I doubt they called you to DUMP (as you say) Dad. I think more they wanted to sincerely know if you were that rare one with the courage to attempt to take on elder care with in home rehab with the WISH to do so.  You aren't.  That's just fine. Either am I. I loved nursing but doing it 24/7? Nope. So on you go now. Get in touch with Social Worker and Nurse Manager and Discharge Planner and lay down the law as to what you will not do. They will ask you who is POA and who is familiar with Dad's finances if he cannot discuss that himself so they can get him the very best care his money can buy. Do know that he will have at least 20 days of rehab at medicare cost to get his ADLs and mobility going. Time will tell. I wish you the best and your Dad as well. Hope he recovers well and is soon back on his feet. Sounds like he was real active if this was a ski accident. A month of rehab and he may be right back at his near normal level.

Her O2 machine was running constantly for the past year and turning that off after she passed... the quiet. And now during the day when I would normally check on her and get her something to eat after finishing a conference call...the quiet and the loneliness.She was mentally strong but her COPD and heart issues took their toll. For a good while she always got up every day dressed read books got on FB even baked for us sometimes. Then the past couple of months I saw her slowing down..until within the last couple of weeks she started sleeping didn't have much interest in getting on her iPad to read or do FB. But she still got up and came to the family room until her very last day. I feel I was in denial that it was actually happening and then happening so fast. I feel I wasted time I could have taken off work to spend with her in those final weeks. I know she was comforted to be here with her family she watched my kids grow up she was loved.

{"post_id": "473350", "title": "What I Learned While I Sat With My Dying Mother For A Week In Memory Care/Assisted Living.", "body": "I sat with my mother in her Memory Care Assisted Living apartment for a week while she took her end-of-life journey recently and I learned an awful lot I wasn't aware of. My DH &amp; I visited her twice a week the past 6 months and at least once a week prior to that so we had contact with the staff the facility saw her apartment the grounds knew what was going on for the most part it's safe to say. What we did not realize was the quality of care she was getting or how happy she was in general. To hear mom tell it she was sad &amp; lonely miserable &amp; praying to God to let her die. That's the message she saved for me and for her niece in New York which made us feel terrible when she'd ask us to 'pray for me to die' or accuse us of not praying 'hard enough' because she was still alive. I lived with a constant low-level of guilt &amp; a feeling of not being a good enough daughter due to mom's chronic complaining about everything from the food to the weather to the lack of activities in the MC. No matter that I (nor anyone else) could NEVER reach her on the phone for her being busy in the activities room.What I learned while sitting with her for many hours each day for an entire week was that the caregivers went out of their way to shower mom with love &amp; affection &amp; attention. They came into her room every 20 minutes to see what she needed; to kiss her forehead &amp; tell her they loved her. Some stayed AFTER their shift ended to sit with her! They'd pull up a chair and sit next to her bed hold her hand and recount stories of the time they'd spent together. There was a constant stream of CGs &amp; other staff in and out of her room for an entire week. When going through her things I found dozens and dozens of handwritten cards from former caregivers that had quit and moved away; they wrote mom cards to let her know how they were doing! Or if they'd gotten married or had a baby! To let her know they were thinking of her and missed her. One gal named Angelica told me she was honored to know mom at the end of mom's life and at the beginning of HER life b/c she would carry her memory with her for life. The testimonies I heard were mind boggling.As it turned out mom was always positive upbeat smiling &amp; happy as a resident in Memory Care (and in AL before that). She was the cheerleader for all the residents! Always the first in line for the activities and to encourage the others to join in! Who knew? Not I that's for sure.This was the woman who made my life so difficult on every level for 64 years. Led me to believe she was so unhappy and sad in Memory Care in spite of me KNOWING she was well cared for fat &amp; happy. I could never get her to admit it  not even once in the nearly 3 years she lived there. I did everything humanly possible for the woman to make her life as comfortable as possible and I succeeded I just didn't KNOW it until I witnessed the testimony from the staff during the last week of mom's life.And I got a call from the Assistant ED the other day telling me that the trail of emails that went back &amp; forth after the staff was notified of mom's passing was THE most incredible thing she'd ever witnessed. The communication between the Assisted Living bldg and the Memory Care bldg was huge all the caregivers &amp; nurses expressing their sadness at her passing and offering condolences.For those who feel 'guilt' at having their loved on in residential care just take heed. Things aren't always what they appear to be.Rest in peace mom.

{"post_id": "473282", "title": "My unvaccinated next-door neighbor is now dead.", "body": "In the last 3 months I've known 3 people who died from covid. All were unvaccinated all had underlying conditions such as diabetes prior smoking obesity. Sometimes I think men wait too long to seek medical help (this is a generalization) and then show up in the ER already too far gone for treatments to be effective. Who knows: maybe your neighbor might have been a smoker in his teens until quitting at 40 but still long enough for permanent lung damage to have occurred. He may have been in denial about his risk level.  Then there's my husband: 64 unvaccinated and has not even been sick since 2019. He went on a missions trip to Turkey this past December and had to have PCR tests before traveling there and back but in Turkey spent a lot of time without a mask and among many unvaccinated people. It's not that he was sick at some point in the past few years and didn't get tested - he has not been sick period. I got original covid in March 2021 got the Pfizer vaccine in July then (probably) got Omicron in early December (but didn't bother to get tested because there was no point). My eldest son (age 31 also unvaccinated and a smoker) has been mildly sick but never tested. His own elementary-aged son has had covid.   I think some people have some sort of natural immunity and I think some people have the opposite: an unknown biological Achilles heel when it comes to covid. We are all on a spectrum. Just like some people have a reaction to the vaccine enough that it kills them but this is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless it has happened.   In May 2020 my MIL in LTC got original covid and was at death's door. Went on hospice and then had a rapid and full recovery. Her only underlying health condition was being 85. She was overweight at 185 and 5'6\". Nine other people on her floor died during that outbreak.   This morning I was power walking with my friend in the Mall of America (a gigantic mall). She has 2 twin grandsons who were born at 23 weeks and are now 15 months old but have compromised lungs and too young for the vaccine. My friend still has to follow rigid protection protocols if she wants to babysit her grandsons. It is very hard on her and her husband (because they still mostly socially isolate and don't dine out) and she has no idea when she can drive in a car with another person or stop wearing 2 masks while mall walking 6 feet away from me. Even if everyone else was following her protocol she would still be doing it too because she wouldn't want to risk the lives of her grandsons or not ever see them in person. So the wisest philosophy is to let everyone live as they choose and if you're someone at risk then you have to do what you must to protect yourself.   No one should be telling anyone else how to manage their health. Your neighbor had every right to reject the vaccine. Freedom isn't free because there are consequences to the choices we make. Everyone needs to calculate their own risks and live accordingly.", "date": "2022-02-24 13:42:30", "user_name": "Geaton777", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/my-unvaccinated-next-door-neighbor-is-now-dead-473282.htm"},

You should have no regrets and absolutely no guilt. You did an amazing job you were a loving caring daughter.  I know what you mean about the quiet. The morning the Funeral Home came to take my Husband and I shut off the bed I could not believe how quiet the house was. I actually turned the bed back on later and slept in it just to hear the \"noise\". For months I would wake up at the same time I did for 5 years to check on him change him and make sure he was not tangled up in sheets. (and to see if I needed to change the sheets as well) For a long time I would check my watch to see if I had time for 1 more thing before I had to get back before the caregiver had to leave...only to remember that there was no caregiver that I had to get back for.  All that passes.  The difficult thing now is to find your \"New Normal\" and to find out who you are now that you are no longer a full time caregiver. Rediscovering yourself finding out who you and your husband are as a couple.   Forget what I call the \"Wouldacouldashoulda\" you can not change what was you can only move forward.

Until one day she went to bed and became unresponsive and died exactly one week later. Without much 'warning' either. But the way I look at it she lived life to the best of her ability right to the very end. And so did YOUR mother.   You didn't miss anything nor were you in 'denial'. Your mother played the game of life beautifully until she could play it no longer. She was loved and cared for by you and your family and she felt that love on a daily basis. Stop beating yourself up for what you 'didn't' do or what you 'missed' and realize this: Mom didn't want you to know she was fading away as my mom didn't want anyone to know SHE was fading away. They lived life to the fullest until they couldn't anymore then God took them Home as mercifully as possible.  It's okay to cry and to feel the loss that mom's absence has made in your life.

That should bring you great peace and joy.  And know too that feeling a sense of what do I do now that I don't have someone to care for is quite normal for us caregivers. I cared for my husband for many years and after he died I wandered around my house for months wondering what it was I was supposed to be doing now. He too was on oxygen for the last 22 months of his life and I had to get used to the quiet in my house after he passed without the oxygen concentrator running but I can tell you now that I really enjoy the quiet in my house especially first thing in the morning.

I do have to say that my realtor has been very good.   I am down to the last transactions and pray that this comes off without a hitch.

Remember to try to change out your G-WORDS because words matter in our brains. GUILT means you are an evil doer who did things all wrong on purpose and everyone suffered for it and would you have done things altogether differently your Mom would be here. Those in our world who SHOULD feel guilt are for the most part incapable of it.  But GRIEF knows that you suffered in pain WITH your Mom in confusion about what was best and that you tried to do the best FOR her given you are not god but a human being with limitations and no magic wands.  You saw her comfort and you know now you need never fear for her again; she is at peace. You can remember the comfort she had and can celebrate her life. The experts say sometimes we stay in \"guilt\" so we don't have to face Grief because grief feels so final. It means you have to let go. And you will have to but you will do it in your own way your own time and while you live on some level your Mom will always be there with you. I am 80. My Mom is Frances and she is there for me still a friend a helpmate.  When my beloved brother died a man I always exchanged long letters with when we didn't live in the same city I continued to write him tell him things I wished could have been different told him what I saw that day that made me smile and remember him decorated it with pressed flowers and collage. About one year later a bit before I felt myself letting go (more it felt as though he were \"moving away\" from me \"moving on\"). Whatever it was I think of him daily still always with a smile wonder sometimes if I am changing him into a mythological creature who was \"almost always good\".

It came unexpectedly although she's been declining for the past 6 months. I believe she had a TIA about 12 days ago b/c her upper lip was droopy and she was slumping over more than usual in her wheelchair. The hospice nurse advised that TIA are oftentimes precursors to bigger events down the road. On Sunday of this week she could no longer sit up in her wheelchair &amp; had to be moved into her easy chair in her apartment. On Tuesday she went to bed and has been there ever since. I feel like she may have had a real stroke but we'll never know for sure.She's now developed a fever and is short of breath; the nurse feels heart failure is at play. She's being kept comfortable by hospice who's been marvelous since they accepted her in late December. I've been visiting her every day &amp; listening to her whisper to someone she's having a conversation with that I can't see. It's probably one of her beloved late sister's she's been talking about incessantly for months now. :)We are scheduled to leave for AZ next Friday for my DH to have a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. We can postpone the trip if necessary by about a week or so. I don't feel like my mother is going to last too much longer in this condition though but only God knows her future.Please keep us in your prayers if you are so inclined as this is a particularly difficult time with mom's transition and an impending liver transplant coming up. I fluctuate between feeling relieved that her pain &amp; suffering is coming to an end and incredibly sad at the same time for having to bury my mother.

{"post_id": "473310", "title": "Wanted to post an update, in hopes of helping others: Just got my very stubborn mother with mid-stage dementia to agree to assisted living. Here's how...", "body": "I posted previously on this if anyone is interested in reading the history on it. Briefly mother has mid-stage dementia and lives alone. Super stubborn and has said for years that she never wants to move. No longer drives (because I anonymously reported her to DMV because she was getting lost) and therefore relies on me for groceries Dr's appts etc. I'm an only child single mom who is doing the best she can to help from across town but it's become super stressful to manage. Got her to sign POA a few months ago before her conditioned worsened.Today I took her to neurology appt (her 2nd) where the neurologist and I both let her know for about 30 minutes that it was unsafe for her to live alone and that is was crucial for her to move. She was a little testy during the appointment because she felt ganged up on but we let her know that we are just trying to help her because often those with dementia can't see what others see. We let her know that after this appointment we had a 2nd appointment to go visit an assisted living facility. Unbeknowst to her earlier in the week we had already been there (under the guise of testing for her primary care doctor) where they had done the initial assessment and SLUMS test. That way they could determine if she was assisted living vs dementia resident. At the assisted living appointment we had same conversations with her but also did a tour of the facility and specific rooms. We sold it under the guise that her doctor set this up because she's worried about her weight loss her nutrition socialization and brain health. She'd be on a \"30 day program\" and we could evaluate it after the 30 days and see if she'd like to renew. This way it makes her feel that she has some agency in the decision overall and that she can leave after the 30 days if she likes (it's month to month so it's not entirely a fabrication). We just stayed with the conversation until we got a yes. She seemed to really like the fact that it was month to month and that this program could help her brain and help her feel better (which is SO true because she'll be eating drinking water and socializing at the very least). She currently sleeps about 20 hours a day and is forgetting to eat.So as you might imagine I'm so very relieved and happy to have her placed very soon and have all of this caregiving maddness behind me. All of this is such a wild ride. I'm happy to being able to return to being a daughter and not a caregiver.Hope this helps anyone that might need some ideas.", "date": "2022-02-26 00:48:53", "user_name": "reasoa", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Care Decisions", "Moving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-mother-with-mid-stage-dementia-agreed-to-assisted-living-heres-how-473310.htm"},

(she was in any case all her life an extremely smiley person; always laughing). the facility was super clean caring.  i visited a friend\u2019s dear parent in a facility in croatia. awful!! very sad. but there was no choice. my friend can\u2019t keep her mother home. (i\u2019m not saying all facilities in croatia are bad).  \u2014on the other hand in some cases keeping a LO home is the best thing to do!   it\u2019s so case-specific. \u2026where you live (town/city\u2026) \u2026how much money you have \u2026how old is the helping adult child \u2026how difficult is the LO \u2026what does the LO want \u2026etc.  \u2014\u2014\u2014 i personally am not against - all - facilities in the world.  i\u2019m against the facilities where i live (when i say \u201cwhere i live\u201d i don\u2019t mean my entire country. i mean where i live).   but even if the facilities would be great i would do all i can to keep my parents home. but that\u2019s because in my case it\u2019s possible. we can hire caregivers. and my parents are extreeeemely happy at home.  if absolutely necessary my parents are absolutely willing to go to a facility. none of us in our family say \u201cnever\u201d. we know there are many factors. unexpected factors can come up.  \u2014\u2014\u2014  it\u2019s amazing to read on this website all the love people give their LOs (whether in a facility at home whatever).  you can feel so much love.  you can also feel the huge challenges many of us face in this rollercoaster of emergencies/helping our (kind or mean) LOs.  \u2014\u2014\u2014  hugs! one step at a time.  :) don\u2019t sacrifice your ONE life health\u2026  live a full life!!! :) :) :) don\u2019t wait for someone to rescue you.  bundle of joy :)", "date": "2022-03-01 15:57:31", "user_name": "bundleofjoy", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-mother-with-mid-stage-dementia-agreed-to-assisted-living-heres-how-473310.htm"},

Hospice was phenomenal and kept her comfortable the entire week. She got to see her great grandson again and she woke up when she heard him cry. She saw her grandchildren and all the caregivers were in and out of her room the entire week paying their respects. One young and particularly lovely girl named Angelica said she was honored to meet mom at the end of her life when she was beginning hers so she could carry her memory with her forever. That touched me tremendously.  We can leave for AZ soon without the worry of mom's declining health hanging over us thank God. We're waiting for a call from thr Mayo clinic tomorrow to see about driving down there.  Thank you to all who have reached out with kindness at this difficult time. I appreciate it", "date": "2022-02-23 02:16:40", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/mom-is-transitioning-473157.htm"},
