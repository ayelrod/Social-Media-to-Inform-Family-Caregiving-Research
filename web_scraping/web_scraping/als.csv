49541,2021-11-11 00:00:00,Hot flashes?,My 54 year old PALS husband has started experiencing hot flashes- I’m trying to figure out if it’s a drug side effect or a new symptom- any insight?   He’s limb onset uses a bipap about 16 hours a day still eating/drinking/talking.

49555,2021-11-13 00:00:00,Help ?….,Question my dad has ALS bulbar onset for about 5 months already. He’s lost tons of weight and just had a peg tube placed last Thursday. Since we started feeding through the tube 4-6 formula bottles a day he had started feeling like he had life again. We were all so happy knowing he’s getting the nutrients and all meds that he needed. However we noticed he had been getting up a lot at night to use the RR. So we decided to stop feeding after 6 and he could still eat a few bites of cake or something like that. Well it’s gotten to the point where he doesn’t want to go anywhere and he can’t sleep cuz he always has the urge to pee. He goes all the time and he says it’s just a little trickle but the urge is there. He didn’t sleep last night because of this. Is this another symptom of ALS ?,False,Jdeanda,2021-07-30 00:00:00,22,CALS,2021-07-01 00:00:00,US,TX,corpus christi,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/help.49555/
49492,2021-11-02 00:00:00,Preventing bed sores transfers and breathing issues while lying down,Hello I have three main questions and I'm also curious how other families are handling these issues.  1. How do you prevent and/or treat bed sores? My dad is mostly sitting upright in bed and there's always pressure on his tailbone. He can't lie down or on the side because it makes it too hard for him to breathe. It's difficult to find a position that will relieve the tailbone because it seems to be the only position he can be on when he is in bed.  2. Does your family member transfer from bed to chair and if so what kind of chair and how do they transfer? My dad is able to slowly slide himself from bed to chair in the afternoon and then we hoyer lift him back into bed at night. The downside is that we have to use a regular wooden chair with no arm rests so it's not the most comfortable.  3. My dad can't breathe if lying flat or on his side. I'm wondering if this is something experienced by all ALS patients because of their weakened diaphragm?  Thank you.,False,Adviceseeker1,2021-05-15 00:00:00,12,CALS,2021-02-01 00:00:00,US,,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/preventing-bed-sores-transfers-and-breathing-issues-while-lying-down.49492/
49678,2021-12-09 00:00:00,Dad refusing to see more doctors,Good Morning my fellow caregivers. It has been one hell of a month so far and its only the 9th. We went to an ALS clinic in SA and got alot of information that was real helpful but my dad already said he doesn't want to ever go again. That he knows what's going to happen and doesn't need anyone telling him anything. I must say he has declined pretty rapidly. We've had to take him to the urgent care the other night because of severe constipation. My dad is so exhausted. His voice is just about gone and he's twitching more in his hands and feet. He can still get around but not for long because he gets SOB. He cried to me last night that all he ever asked for in life was when it was his time to go all he wanted was to go quick and not suffer or have us suffer. that broke me into pieces. He also said he really does not want to see anymore drs that there isn't any point.

49541,2021-11-11 00:00:00,Hot flashes?,Please let me start by saying I'm sorry we are welcoming you here. I would check with his neurologist to be sure of his particular case. PALS have problems regulating their body temperature and so the hot flashes may be connected to this - he feels cool but once you apply socks clothing blanket or whatever he warms up and keeps warming and so becomes suddenly hot.

49541,2021-11-12 00:00:00,Hot flashes?,I was taking you literally that there was no cold before the hot flashes. But if there is of course Tillie's thought is well taken.  On the other hand a couple of the drugs he is on affect autonomic function including temperature regulation and are sedating as well which can also impair breathing btw.   So if he is wanting to be more active and feeling sleepy or tired the very act of fighting that off could be draining and lead to further dysregulation. And ALS drains a lot of energy as is.   I would consider some drug review conversations with his prescribers and discuss whether titrating or a different regimen might help but not just in terms of the hot flashes. As ALS progresses the needs for cardiovascular and CNS drugs can change so it's quite common to make adjustments as you go. Given the drugs he's on it's at least worth considering that some adjustments could help his overall wellbeing.

I wouldn't restrict fluids right now -- I would try to see if he can reset. If that doesn't happen in a few days he might need meds or catheterization so I would consult with his PCP.

Catheterisation is often used when a PALS can't control things but if it is just at night there are condom catheters that can be popped on at night so he can sleep soundly.

49492,2021-11-02 00:00:00,Preventing bed sores transfers and breathing issues while lying down,Does your dad have a hospital bed? Does he use a BiPAP? He should not have to sit up to breathe. And if he needs a Hoyer for assisted transfers he probably shouldn't be doing unassisted transfers -- remember the idea is not to use up unrenewable energy in routine activity like transfers but to save it for things that are more enjoyable.  I'm sorry why is he not transferring to a wheelchair or lift chair? A regular chair does sound very uncomfortable.

49492,2021-11-02 00:00:00,Preventing bed sores transfers and breathing issues while lying down,An alternating air mattress on a hospital bed and a rehab wheel chair with an air cushion are important! He should not be sitting in a hard chair and eventually he will need a rehab chair that reclines in order to take pressure off his tailbone. Once the pressure sores started we used special pads and diaper cream. It's essential that you keep the area clean and dry and change pressure points routinely (tilting the seat of the rehab chair 45 minutes out of every hour for instance).  As Laurie mentioned a Bipap is needed to help with breathing. Is your dad seen at an ALS clinic? They should be able to assist you with the appropriate equipment.,True,Nuts,2014-02-23 00:00:00,2576,Lost a loved one,2014-01-01 00:00:00,US,NC,Littleton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/preventing-bed-sores-transfers-and-breathing-issues-while-lying-down.49492/
49492,2021-11-02 00:00:00,Preventing bed sores transfers and breathing issues while lying down,Preventing bedsores is much more important than it may seem.  I had bedsores on my heels and it was very unpleasant and required a long time to heal. Don't underestimate how they may impact your dad's life and how difficult they may be to heal. Prevention is everything!  I use a hospital bed with a sophisticated air mattress (designed for the hospital bed) that automatically adjusts the inflation level to reduce the likelihood of bedsores. Since I have been using it I have not had bedsores recur.  I also use a Roho air cushion as the seat in my wheelchairs. They are much more comfortable than foam and do a better job of reducing the likelihood of getting bedsores.  I would not be able to lie flat whether on my back or on either side if I did not use a bipap. I am less affected if I am on my side than if I am on my back though.  If your father cannot breathe adequately it is time to seriously consider a bipap. He does not need to use the bipap all the time only when he is sleeping. I resisted using a bipap for a long time - much too long really. I now find the bipap brings great relief and I have gone from not liking it to liking it a LOT.

49492,2021-11-17 00:00:00,Preventing bed sores transfers and breathing issues while lying down,Hi everyone thank you for the advice. It's hard to find time to come on the forums and respond. I forgot to mention that my dad does use a bipap and he also does have the air mattress that goes on top of the hospital bed. I've taken your advice and convinced my dad to try to take some naps by lying down more and also turning to one side to give on side of his butt some rest and it seems to work well because he realized that he can still breathe with the bipap. I think he was afraid to try to lie down. However he is concerned that he can't sit up to pee and will end up waking someone. Currently if he is sleeping while sitting up he can still use his urinal on his own.  As for sitting I will have to think about using the hoyer lift to get him down. For now though I think he prefers to slide from the bed to the chair and at least maintain some independence while he is still able to move himself a little. We do have a roho cushion for the chair but for some reason he likes using a donut shaped cushion. I did consider everyone's advice and I know that we might have to consider a lift chair or rehab chair in the future. The main reason he slides to the chair is so that he can slide onto the commode and back. After a couple of hours we hoyer lift him back to bed.,True,Adviceseeker1,2021-05-15 00:00:00,12,CALS,2021-02-01 00:00:00,US,,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/preventing-bed-sores-transfers-and-breathing-issues-while-lying-down.49492/
49492,2021-11-17 00:00:00,Preventing bed sores transfers and breathing issues while lying down,We kind of slow transitioned to the hoyer and at first I would use it to get Chris into bed but do a standing transfer to get him out. There is no reason not to use combinations that work. Would he consider a condom catheter while he is sleeping at night so he doesn't have to worry about urinating?  It sounds like you are doing a great job. I always felt like I was just bumbling along from one solution to the next change. In hindsight I managed things pretty darn well. It doesn't always feel that way in the middle of the fray.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/preventing-bed-sores-transfers-and-breathing-issues-while-lying-down.49492/
49492,2021-11-21 00:00:00,Preventing bed sores transfers and breathing issues while lying down,@affected :  Yes I think you're right about using combinations for now. But I also do understand what everyone else meant about using a hoyer primarily because of safety and energy. It's good to know there are options on what to do next. Also thank you for the advice about the catheter. I don't know if it's needed yet but that's something I could probably ask the doctor about. But I also need to ask if his urinating schedule is normal or something that is concerning.  I've still tried to get him to try sleeping on his side like he used to do but he tells me that his leg feels numb after a while. I think we will have to keep trying different or slightly different sleep positions because he still complains about leg and butt skin irritation at night.  I feel the same way. I think we just have to find solutions as the issues come up. My dad is pretty good about finding his own solutions (but sometimes its tiring because we always have to do exactly how he wants it). But overall its going okay so far.

49678,2021-12-09 00:00:00,Dad refusing to see more doctors,I would strongly encourage dad to see his regular doctor and discuss his wishes and he can be referred to hospice. At the end of the day it is his choice and I think we all know what we can cope with. A trusted doctor he knows (the clinic may have been overwhelming for him) and hospice who deal with end of life options all the time may really help him put perspective on what he can make best choices on. I would let him know he is loved and that you will advocate for his choices and want him to make the most informed choices.

49678,2021-12-09 00:00:00,Dad refusing to see more doctors,I know he has a BiPAP -- is he still not using it much? That should address SOB which could be feeding his depression and hopelessness. It's hard to look ahead if you feel smothered (retaining CO2) or hungry for more air.  Of course it's totally his choice not to see more docs. My husband stopped going to clinic nearly 2y before his death and he's not the only one. But I would really try to get him on the BiPAP more even as a comfort measure. If it takes a new mask new settings (lmk if I can help) or encouragement it is probably worth it if he wants to go on even for a short time.  Hospice and/or starting codeine or morphine should be his choices as well. You don't need to be on hospice (and not all agencies are created equal) or go to clinic to either fast forward to the end and wait for nature or give nature a little help if/as that provides the most comfort. Any doc including his PCP can write these drugs. Let us know what kind of support you need.

We've used his PCP for various needs and they've sent a visiting nurse as he is basically homebound now.  It's my understanding that morphine can help with SOB if your dad doesn't want to use the bipap. We were referred to palliative care a while ago and I asked them for a prescription. It sounds like your dad has a more rapid progression than my PALS so perhaps hospice is an option but if he is reluctant to call hospice palliative care could be an option.

49678,2021-12-13 00:00:00,Dad refusing to see more doctors,I had to jump in here as my brother after 2 trips to clinic (2 hours away) firmly decided he didn’t want to go again. First off the ride was long (2 hours each way) and uncomfortable and second he said “ I don’t need anyone to tell me my progression. I know exactly what’s happening”. He saw others more advanced than he at the time and it terrified him. He never did a feeding tube or bi-pap. He decided to let nature take its course. I will say though that he would have never gotten through the air hunger without the morphine and even with at times things got pretty scary. We as CALS have to respect their wishes even if we ourselves wish their choice were different. I (in my mind) selfishly just wanted him for as long as I could have him no matter what.

49678,2021-12-14 00:00:00,Dad refusing to see more doctors,Unfortunately I don't have any good news to report. On Thursday evening my dad was severely SOB. We called the ambulance to take him in. His blood pressure was severely low also. He was put into ICU where it was found that he developed an infection that spread into his blood stream and caused home to become septic. They put a central line in to pump antibiotics. On Friday he wanted to leave. He was so uncomfortable and kept asking to please let him die. We talked him into staying one more night because the infection was so severe and he needed those antibiotics. We brought him on Saturday with hospice care. Before that his blood pressure was starting to normalize and the infection was taking well to the antibiotics. But now we are just crushing them and giving him through PEG tube. Saturday he was really angry because now he lost his ability to talk completely he can't walk he can't hold his head up and is losing ability in his hands. The only thing he keeps on writing is to let him die. That he loves us but he doesn't want to be this way. Hospice came over and left us morphine lorazepam and some other meds. His back his hurting a lot. We decided to give him a small dose of morphine to start out with. Right now his feet are super cold and purple. He does have a DNR in place. We just don't know what to do or is what we are doing right?,True,Jdeanda,2021-07-30 00:00:00,22,CALS,2021-07-01 00:00:00,US,TX,corpus christi,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/dad-refusing-to-see-more-doctors.49678/
49678,2021-12-14 00:00:00,Dad refusing to see more doctors,I am sorry. I know this is excruciatingly painful. You are doing the right thing to follow his wishes and to try to alleviate suffering. I think as well as ALS he has pancreatic cancer? It may well take more than a small dose of morphine to relieve his discomfort. Remember that treating his pain and suffering is his wish and probably the last gift you can give. Please lean on hospice for support.

My palliative care team were so supportive of me as I took my husband through his final days at home. We used lots of morphine and it was very peaceful. If you work closely with them you can make your fathers end a lot more comfortable as he now has a serious acute condition as well.

49678,2021-12-14 00:00:00,Dad refusing to see more doctors,I agree -- this is no time to measure morphine. It's about him. He has made his wishes clear and understandably. Try to look inside yourself and find a way to accept them talk to him make your peace and then in full awareness of the great gift that you are able to give let/help him go. Long goodbyes have nothing to recommend them but a peaceful death with dignity will sustain you past your loss the whole way through and enable his memory to be about the joys you shared. You can do this for him and ultimately also for yourself.

While working on the feeding tube if that's what he wants a high-speed blender can help make smooth foods out of what would normally be harder to eat. Eggs nut butters cream ice cream soft meats mashed potatoes canned fruits except for pineapple etc. are all potential ingredients and that kind of a mixture can also go down a feeding tube if he gets one.

49561,2021-11-15 00:00:00,Hydration nutrition and bowel/urinary incontinence,If you switch from briefs to having her go commando with a chuck on the chair seat tolieting will be much easier. She can either switch to wearing skirts or you can adapt a pair of pants. The simplest way is to open the back seam of sweatpants from the crotch to back waistband. If you search on adaptive pants you'll see some more elegant options. Absolutely have her remain in the sling (split leg) that way you can clean her up after you lift her up off the toilet. With this set up you can either transfer her to the toilet (still in the sling) or lift her from the chair or bed and place a bucket under her. It'll be an adjustment for her but I can't imagine doing it any other way. Absolutely don't limit nutrition or water or you will have a host of other problems that you don't want to deal with.   I adapted sweat pants for my husband and no one ever knew that he was sitting on his bare butt (well except the OT who reached under him to check the inflation on the seat cushion--boy did she get a surprise).

To protect the mattress I always place an underpad   (aka Chux Pad) beneath my PALS when using the Purewick.

48572,2021-05-24 00:00:00,Nearing the end?,My wife was diagnosed in March of 2020 since then it's been a quick and steady progression of loss of function. She was unable to use legs by September arms by November and went on a Bipap full time in late March. It's gone by so quick trying to figure out how to adapt to so many situations and balance taking care of our 4 small boys. Somehow even through the year seems to be gone quickly each night stretches into forever as I switch between cough machine/suction/mask until 5 in the morning.  She hasn't eaten more than a couple hundred calories per day of liquid diet since late April. She claims that it's not because she's having trouble swallowing but denial has been in the mix since this started. It's always been something else besides ALS and various snake-oil naturopaths have been all too quick to confirm that (for a nice hefty fee of course and some supplements that they are all to happy to sell). PEG was never an option because that would have been admitting what was wrong. Now it's too late for that.  I wonder if perhaps this is the best course for her as apposed to losing her lung function. She is unable to tolerate any painkillers every one of them that hospice has tried has made her violently ill. Starving might be a much better fate than going further without a way to suppress the air hunger.  Has anyone seen someone go down this path? Most of what I've read has to do with losing the ability to breathe not this. I'm wondering what to expect.

She is so bored. There comes a point where you've watched all the movies/tv shows listened to all the podcasts/audiobooks/music read all the internet things and you just need something more interactive. We were talking the other day about how she misses playing online games particularly hidden object and Nancy Drew mysteries. She's tried to access her Big Fish account through the Tobii but the program is just not compatible enough to control with the eye gaze. We have Alexa and the Tobii is tied to it but she can't play voice-cued stuff because her speech activation is too slow for Alexa's liking (even with programmed phrases).

49303,2021-10-07 00:00:00,New Caregiver,yes it is a great thing about the g-tube - you can eat and drink as much or little as you want. Some PALS get the tube before they even need it (better to be done while you are in the best physical shape possible) and just flush water through it daily. This helps keep extra hydrated as a side benefit.

49303,2021-10-07 00:00:00,New Caregiver,"@Jdeanda  - My wife was initially misdiagnosed as to the source disease. It was a year and half later that she found herself at Johns Hopkins to get another opinion. The doctor asked about her symptoms. One of the things I commented on was the fact that she had lost a considerable amount of weight... that the rate of loss was increasing... and that she was then losing it at a rate of about 10 pounds per month. I additionally commented on the fact that should could not lay flat as it was difficult to sleep. After we shared the whole of her current symptoms and progression he said...  ""We're going to rerun any and all tests that you might already have been given. We might even do some testing that you've not yet had. But given what you described I believe that we'll find that you have ALS. Even before we get those test results back I want to get you started on a BiPAP machine to help you with your breathing. One of the problems with those afflicted with ALS is that the lungs are not as good at doing what they are designed to do. Your diaphragm is no longer able to expel the accumulated CO2 that results from the breathing process. As a consequence and especially at night when you are laying more flat your body is working especially hard to try to push out that carbon dioxide. In essence it is like you're running a marathon in your sleep because you are working so hard to breathe correctly. And that is likely why you are losing weight as you have.""  Several days later Darcey received her BiPAP and immediately began to use it at night. She found that she slept more peacefully dreamed more fully and woke more rested than she had in ages. And in time we noted that the severe weight loss had abated. Where she would often need multiple daily naps... or even fall asleep in the middle of a conversation... she now found that she was alert and energized until bedtime began to approach. It was a very marked change.  I don't know that this is your Dad's issue with weight loss but I wanted to share our experience so you could compare. I know that it is a difficult journey to watch your Dad's decline and the feeling of helplessness that can accompany the fact that there seems to be little that you can do. Let me tell you though... your being there and your determination to make him as comfortable as possible goes a long long way.  [An aside... Darcey also refused to get a SmartPhone.   Also early on her progression seemed rapid... so steadily declining that her neurologist alerted her to the fact that he believed she was within 6 months of life's end. That was March of 2015. She stayed with us until October of 2020. We really don't know what each tomorrow will bring... so live each day and make it as good as it can be!]  My best to you...

48968,2021-07-31 00:00:00,It's becoming too hard to care my father anymore!,Hello My father has ALS for 2 years.  He is not able to turn himself in the bed or move his hands/arms. He never sleeps on his back because he says he cant doesnt feel comfortable of breathing on his back. He sleep or rest on his left or right sight but he wants to turn because he says he has pain around his hipbones/quad-leg bones when he lay on it and we change it like every 20 minutes if he is awake. When he sleep he wakes up like every 20-30 minutes at night too. She wakes my mother up like 15-20 times a night to make him turn or fix his hand placement etc. He may be calling my mother 100 times a day.  We bought a special comfortable chair(sofa) to him. He first starts to sleep on the double bed at night(my mother is sleeping in the floor because double bed is just required for my father to turn him to left and right). After 3-4 hours he wants to go chair and sleep there 2 hours and wants to go back to bed. In the day time also wants to move between sofa and bed like every hour. If we dont do the thing he want or offer something else he starts to cry. He has all symptoms  including crying-laughing bulbar symptoms(hardly speaking slurring words and it is very hard to understand what he says)  The life started to become unbearable for us. He is mentally weak and this makes the situation more unbearable for all of us. He get sleeping pills but even it doesnt help because he wakes up 20 times a night. During day he wants to move from bed to chair and vice versa for like every hour.  I dont know what we will do. I cant leave home when i want because my mother cant transfer him from chair to wheelchair/bed/toilet without manpower. Is there any way to make him sleep without waking up so often? Doctor gave him antidepressants and pills to sleep better but although its sedating him it doesnt prevent him wake up like every 20-30 minutes. My mother is having so hard time.

45876,2020-03-10 00:00:00,Caregiver Needing a Night of Rest,"rann  I remember existing through that very same scenario as your mom and dad. My wife Darcey would need to be turned every 1 to 1-1/2 hours throughout the night. Even though I was reasonably able to quickly go back to sleep I was probably not entering that deep sleep stage. I'd move through the daylight hours feeling exhausted all the time... both physically and mentally. I didn't live through those days... I existed.  One day I mentioned this sleep dilemma to Darcey's Respiratory Therapist. Fortunately for us she is also our local ALS.ORG contact. She said ""Let me check the loaner closet to see if we have something that I think will help!"" The next day I got a call from someone at the loaner closet asking if they could deliver a "" 8"" Low Pressure Low Loss Alternating Air Mattress "" to us."" The next day it was delivered.  That night I asked Darcey if I could put the new mattress on her hospital bed. ""No... not tonight"" was her reply. This went on for a couple more days... each day with the same question followed by the same ""not tonight"" reply. One day I didn't ask. Instead I went upstairs into our bedroom pulled off the existing thin mattress and strapped in the new 8"" air mattress. That was the night that MY LIFE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY!  Darcey was surprised that I'd gone ahead and made the mattress change without asking. But it was on the bed it was time to try and sleep so she just went with it. It was the first time in months that either of us had slept through the night. She slept for 8 straight hours... as did I. I've lost count of the times that we've looked back to that night. Again it was life changing!!!  Darcey outlived the life of that first ALS Loaner Locker mattress... and I immediately purchased another. Darcey rarely wakes during the night. She sleeps so deeply and so soundly that she barely notices that I move her in the middle of the night. I'll get up once or twice during the night to use the toilet. Before I crawl back in bed I'll raise the head of her bed fully upright. I'll then pull her arms forward (so that they're not anchor points for her upper torso) hold her at both shoulders and move her around a bit. Most nights she doesn't even remember that I'd done so.  The alternating air mattress minimizes or eliminates the sore spots that can develop from sleeping in the same position for an extended amount of time. If I didn't move her around at least once during the night she would wake with sore joints. The movement helps minimize that morning soreness.  I can't stress enough how life changing switching to this mattress was for us. I suspect that the experience might be different for each of us but I can't imagine a scenario wherein one would not find better sleep. And when the PALS can sleep so can the CALS. It is much easier to find things to laugh and smile for when one starts the day after a good full nights sleep.  My best...

It is really hard to advocate for our PALS but they make their choices and you are doing the hardest thing there is to just support her.  Are you saying her breathing is not affected yet? If she is taking in a few hundred calories per day and breathing is fine she could linger for months.  I'm sorry you are doing it this way.

48572,2021-05-29 00:00:00,Nearing the end?,My PALS had relatively fast progression. He died 16 months after diagnosis. Breathing was least affected and he could be without bipap for a long time. He used it in the end though - some. He also did not have a feeding tube. What happened was that most likely not getting enough calories sped up the progression and eventually he could not swallow any longer. Nothing. Hospice recommended morphine and Ativan. I don't think I would want to do this without. Not sure if your wife is also not tolerating these... and what else is available. He died of ALS but also of lack of water and food.... It took longer than Hospice expected. If it is too late for a tube that's possibly what will happen. There are these little sponges on sticks that we used to moisten his mouth small ice chips. I think it gave him some comfort but it sure was very hard to watch and for him it was very hard as well.

48670,2021-06-09 00:00:00,Toileting help/Sling advice,My caregiver can get pants or boxers on/off without me ever standing. I only wear one or the other it's a pain to do both. I sleep in my lift recliner. I use a U sling (butt is open/free). Trip to bathroom from lift chair goes like this: - raise chair to lift position pull pants a third of the way down and place sling behind the back  - lower chair to seated position and place sling under legs  - lift. While in the air pull pants down another third  - Once on the shower/commode chair the last third down  - pulling back up is just the reverse. Basically each part of the transfer the goal is to move the pants as far as you can without using excessive force. Definitely need to use loose fitting with preferably not too thick a waist band,True,Jimi,2019-09-24 00:00:00,194,PALS,2015-02-01 00:00:00,US,CA,Torrance,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/toileting-help-sling-advice.48670/

48517,2021-05-15 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Hi and sorry to welcome you. Transferring is done with an electric hoist a common brand is hoyer and we often call them that. You can search here to get lots of general information too and that can help you then ask more questions.  I had some paid care workers that came in and helped a little but did the bulk of the caring for my husband. If you have family that can all help that is fantastic. The best strategy might be to all have a discussion about what will work for everyone and find someone that is best able to take on making a kind of roster. Make sure you involve your dad in all this and his wishes.  I took an antidepressant saw a counsellor regularly and talked here and in private groups daily and it made the world of difference in coping emotionally as it is the hardest thing I've ever done. We will help how we can.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/
48517,2021-05-15 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,"Welcome while sorry to hear about your dad. In the US some ALS Association chapters provide ""loaner"" power lifts for the duration. That is the first place to go. Otherwise you can try finding a used one or buying one on a site like SpinLife. You can find lots of Hoyer lift videos on YouTube etc. Your dad will also need a ""divided leg"" or ""U sling"" that holds him in the lift. They come in different sizes and are machine washable. These are readily available on line.  I suggest that you get to work on the power chair order with his clinic. Including insurance approval it can take months and your dad's progression will continue. You don't want him to lose the ability to go out. Meanwhile whatever he needs to not fall -- a cane rollator manual wheelchair -- is what he should have.  The search link on the top of this page is your friend -- you can find many threads on the questions you are asking. Of course we are always happy to help.

48517,2021-05-20 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Regarding the power chair are they meant for patients who can still stand? My dad can stand but not for too long. I don't want to risk him falling. Also how are they transported by car? Can the chair be brought upstairs if you have a two story house?  I did hear about the hoyer lift from my dad's doctor. But currently I'm thinking more along the lines of a transfer board. I bought one on amazon and will try it soon. I'm hoping it can get him to go from the bed to the wheelchair without standing.  Another question is regarding showers. I used to have him go on a transfer bench that can slide him into the tub but since he has a hard time standing now my family has just been giving him sponge baths using towels and disposable bath sponges. I'm wondering if that is an okay alternative to getting him into the shower.   Also instead of using a toilet we just have him use a bedside commode because he is still able to slide himself from the bed to the commode. He used to go to the toilet because we had a toilet rail but it's been too risky for him to transfer on and off the toilet because he cannot stand that long.  Sorry for the long post a lot is on my mind.,True,Adviceseeker1,2021-05-15 00:00:00,12,CALS,2021-02-01 00:00:00,US,,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/
48517,2021-05-20 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Again it can easily take months to get a chair so if your dad is iffy on standing it's time to start the process with your clinic. The evaluation that is required ensures that it will not be a frivolous purchase on the insurance company's part. If you wait until he can't stand he will require a manual wheelchair that will not support him as well as a power chair nor is it as usable with the Hoyer. The alternative is staying in bed hardly a good option.  A transfer board may work for a time but again when you need a Hoyer you really need it so it's something to get in advance i.e. as soon as you can. A transfer board also carries a greater risk of falls or injury if someone's core is not completely stable their legs are caught etc.  The reason we talk about a ShowerBuddy or roll-in shower is that running water has a number of benefits for the skin and spirit so we generally try to keep showers going as long as possible which is essentially as long as someone can stay upright and comfortable in a shower chair or sling for the duration of a shower.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/
48517,2021-05-20 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,"As my PALS began to have difficulty transferring we tried a number of alternatives... especially as it related to bathing. For a time we used a sliding transfer chair that had one side outside the bathtub and the other side was inside the bathtub. I'd seat Darcey on the sliding seat portion lift her legs and slide her over the side of the tub.  Darcey used to get headaches and would generally feel poorly when it was bath night. I asked her about it as those episodes always seemed to coincide with getting her in and out of the bath. She said that she really didn't think that they were related. After a while we were able to move away from the sliding seat in the tub and began to use our newly finished walk-in shower. Now I was sitting Darcey into a shower chair and could roll her into the shower. The headaches went away and it began to appear that she was really enjoying bath time again. After a couple of months she said...  ""Remember when you asked me about my headaches on bath nights? Then I didn't see any connection. But now with how easy and safe it feels to get a shower I realize exactly what was going on. I believe I was as some deeper and hidden level fearful of the process of bathing. First I had to transfer from the electric scooter to the sliding tub chair. There was some amount of time that I had my weight on my legs... and I think I was fearful of falling. And I knew that if I fell you would not be able to get me up on your own. Once on the sliding tub seat you'd think that I'd feel safe again... but I didn't. When you'd lift my legs so that they would be out of the way of the side of the tub I think I was again scared of falling out of the seat. And once I was actually sitting in the tub area I still had the whole of the reverse of the process yet to come. By the time the bath was done and I was safely tucked into bed I was physically and mentally exhausted!""  ""Since we've begun to use the walk-in shower you're lifting me off the scooter pivoting and setting me into the shower chair. I'm not having to support myself on legs that don't want to support me well anymore. I also feel well supported in the shower chair rather than always feeling like I'm right at the edge of almost falling. I'm now enjoying the shower as something refreshing and wondrous... rather than dreading bath night. Best of all I don't get a headache and I'm not exhausted upon finishing. I guess that I just couldn't see it while actually in the midst of it. Or perhaps I was subconsciously trying to bury my fear as we had no other alternatives at the time.""  It would not be too long after this point that we quit using the electric scooter and did all transfers with a hoyer lift. Had we known how much better using the hoyer was... ON BOTH OF US... we'd have moved to its use so much earlier!  Anyway... I don't know if our story helps you write yours... but I wanted to put it out there.  My best...

48941,2021-07-24 00:00:00,The endless todo list shortens v4.0,Nikki makes the best points - with anything being a little even a lot ahead can make all the difference. Getting a PEG before losing weight and having awful choking episodes can make a huge difference to quality of life. Also just recovering from the procedure. Learning to use eye gaze equipment takes time patience and lots of practice. It is so much easier to put this time in while still able to communicate without it and feel really confident when things start to really get hard. Finding you can't communicate and need to learn a whole new technology can be overwhelming and frustrating take longer and become more exhausting.

The developer is actually in Woodinville so maybe you could get a loaner to try out.   Has she tried the Tobii software that works with the Surface? That combination is said to be more responsive than the Tobii hardware.

44939,2019-08-23 00:00:00,New member and my pals is SO BORED! Online game rec's?,To follow up on Laurie one of those types of switches is called an Acorn switch. Not inexpensive but you can get one on amazon or your loaner closet may have one you can try. Technically it is a proximal sensor switch. Meaning it doesn’t actually have to be touched. It can sense movement such as jaw. Then it gets plugged into the Tobii and acts as mouse clicks.  My DH used Netflix but I’m sure he too was bored at times. He always enjoyed people stopping by and telling him about their lives. That one was tougher because most people pulled away after his DX.

If he wishes to continue on it sounds like time for a feeding tube if it is difficulty with eating that is causing the weight loss. That would be something to arrange before it is too late. The path is his choice but you can present the facts that if he keeps on his current course he will die if only from malnutrition and that for many is not the ideal passage. You can also discuss if he has future events or activities that may be motivating for reversing his decline.

There are many possible ways to help but some of them depend on knowing more about your situation.  Does your dad use a BiPAP machine? Not breathing well is a common reason for waking up because the person never gets very deeply to sleep. Is the double bed a hospital bed where the head or feet can go up?

48968,2021-08-08 00:00:00,It's becoming too hard to care my father anymore!,"He is not using bipap. He is just using antidepressant and sleeping pills without them the case is worse. He wakes up and says ""turn me"" or wants us to change his hand/arm/leg position and similiar things.   We bought a 4-motors hospital bed but he didn't get comfortable on it and not using it. Because he never lays or sleeps on his back he is sleeping on his sides and turning from left to right or from right to left on a single bed is much harder for us and requires much more power. So he sleeps on normal double bedroom bed. Its a normal comfortable bed and the issue is not about bed's comfort quality. He just wakes up and wants to turn. The thing is that the life is harder for my mother because it is so hard to care my father in these conditions. The doctor increases sleeping pills from 50mg to 100mg and then to 150mg there is not a big difference. He is sleepy and sedative after taking pillls but still waking up 15 times a night.  Even i can not leave the house when i want for more than a few hours. Because my father wants to go to toilet many times in a day and he has to be lifted by a man power from bed/couch/toilet. I will buy a lifter for him so i can at least leave the house more easily. But my mother will still have nightmare nights and we can not find a way that make him sleep better and do not require wake my mother so many times when sleeping.",True,Alsmess,2019-07-27 00:00:00,15,Loved one DX,2019-07-01 00:00:00,TR,TR,Istanbul,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/its-becoming-too-hard-to-care-my-father-anymore.48968/

The fact that you say he finds it hard to breathe on his back suggests strongly that for his breathing to be supported that he needs the machine.  I understand what you mean about the bed but sleeping flat is also bad for breathing and causes more pain for someone who cannot move and so is ""lying over"" all his joints.

I elevate his head just a little. The bed is on special 8 inch risers making it higher than normal. This has worked fine so far and he sleeps through the night most nights. No pressure points/sores or joint pain  we are in our 6th year.

45876,2020-03-23 00:00:00,Caregiver Needing a Night of Rest,"Bill  I would be glad to... especially since I know there to be some knockoffs that are not what they are advertised to be. I was careful about placing my order with Amazon... down to making sure that I was getting the EXACT model number that I wanted. The order through Amazon was fulfilled by a 3rd party in Florida. Upon its arrival I carefully opened the box but not the clear plastic it was encased in. I wanted to verify that it was actually as I'd ordered it. To my surprise and dismay it was a different model number... one that had a lower maximum weight and a lesser warranty (even though from the same manufacturer).  I first began on the premise that it was an accidental mistake... that someone simply grabbed the wrong box. But when I could not get a reply from the Seller I contacted Amazon. They contacted the Seller and suggested that they quit ignoring me. This resulted in my receipt of an email asking that I call the Seller directly. After several days of leaving messages with no return call I again contacted Amazon. This resulted in a phone call from the Seller.  After apologizing profusely for there being an issue in the first place (such apology being implied as to cover every delay to that point in time) he said that it was an error at the warehouse. The person picking the item ordered had pulled a more expensive item from inventory... one the was much better than the one I'd ordered. He went on to say that he should issue a call tag for it so I could return it and get the one that I'd actually ordered. But seeing as this had been their mistake he'd take the loss and would allow me to keep the better and more expensive one that was actually shipped instead.  I pointed out to him that the ""better and more expensive one"" was actually listed by him on Amazon at half the price of what I'd already paid. He then offered to refund me the difference. When I said that it wasn't the one that I wanted he offered to sell me one of the ""private brand"" items that he'd just had a truck load of delivered. These he said were better than any model the original manufacturer made and I could have one for a minimal upward price adjustment to what I'd already paid. It was then that I asked that he simply issue a call tag and refund my purchase.  It was another week or so before enough time would pass that Amazon would force a call tag from the guy and have him issue an immediate refund. Fortunately I would find the exact one that I wanted in an Amazon (as Seller and shipper) listing for less than the amount I initially had paid.  So... why take time to write so many details? My hope is that (1) folks will understand how important it is to specify what you want (2) to verify that what you order is what you get and (3) to encourage our awesome moderators to allow my information to post through (they do one heck of a job at trying to keep links to a minimum so as to minimize the likelihood that we forum members aren't fleeced or taken advantage of... and I appreciate each and every one of them!!!).  In a moment I'll research back to what it was that I ordered. It may take some time... and might even be tomorrow before I post. I'll ask the moderators to remove any portions of my next post that they believe needs to be removed.  Please recognize that I'm providing you the information of what we first had and what I replaced it with. Others make similar items that my be equal or better than what we've used. And should you actually purchase something I hope you'll find it as wonderful (and potentially life enhancing) as we did!  Again my best...

It has a 450 pound maximum weight capacity versus 300 or 350 on the other one. One of the nice features of this in regards to max weight is that each of the inflatable ""cells"" is connected by a connection mechanism that will allow the cell (tube) to disconnect and deflate rather than to allow something to blow/break. I also allows for the ability to deflate any cell (tube) that you want.  The company that attempted to sell me a lesser version and then a ""knockoff"" was Medical Supply Company... though I'm sure they use multiple other names.

48670,2021-06-30 00:00:00,Toileting help/Sling advice,Ouch!!! I am so discouraged. After waiting a week the Liko high back sling finally came. I ordered a medium based on his weight and it barely fits around his middle and the straps don't line up because it is too small. We tried it without crossing the front straps which is probably unsafe. It worked to lift him on and off the toilet. Getting his pants up and down was not so easy but maybe with practice... Totally exhausting for both of us. Frustrated because it was a $600 experiment. And the nighttime caregiver cannot stand him up to pivot transfer anymore it has become very unsafe. I was hoping to train him on the hoyer tonight.  I can't do that if it's unsafe and not exactly easy. Will have to train him on the old sling which requires him to stand up after being placed on the wheelchair just to pull up his pants.  Jim I appreciate the recommendation. I believe this product can and will work if only I had gotten the right size. This was a disappointing setback. The PT said I can try the sling from the failed sit/stand with the regular Hoyer. Maybe I'll try that.

48517,2021-05-21 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Thank you for the info. I didn't realize that you could use a hoyer lift with the power chair. Is a hoyer lift used to bring a patient into any chair? Even on the toilet? Into a car?  When a patient is evaluated for a power chair do the evaluaters also look at the layout of a patient's house? I'm concerned about the small spacing in our small house and bathroom too.   Is the power chair something that can only be used at home? I'm not sure how it would fit in the car. If it does fit in a car how do you get your family member from their power chair into a seat in the car?  As for showers did you have to spend a huge amount of money to renovate your shower into a roll-in shower? I'm looking at the shower buddy too. Is it only useable in tubs? We have a shower with a glass door and at the bottom there is a ledge that you have to step over. Can you use a hoyer lift to get someone into the shower? Can they get hoyer lifted onto the shower buddy?  Another topic regarding CPAP machines: My dad has tried the cpap mask for breathing but is still not comfortable wearing it consistently. I've heard a bipap machine might be useful. Does anyone have experience with this?,True,Adviceseeker1,2021-05-15 00:00:00,12,CALS,2021-02-01 00:00:00,US,,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/
48517,2021-05-21 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,"A Hoyer is a necessity for transferring in and out of bed a power chair or toilet (if that is practical) but very few will work for a car and a PALS that needs a Hoyer won't have the core control/strength to ride in a car seat. Once he is using a power wheelchair the PALS will need to be in the power wheelchair which will be driven using a ramp kneeling lift or level entrance into a adapted van train bus streetcar etc.  I suggest you check out some videos (search for ""power wheelchair"" etc.) for the ""pictures that are worth a thousand words."" I'm sure you've seen someone in a power wheelchair. It can go most places outside the home except for older buildings steps etc.  You will need to make sure the power chair eval includes a home eval or at least a video walkthrough. It used to be part of the package but in these times not always. Not knowing anything about your home if it's very small/narrow it is possible your home may not be compatible with a power chair (1) without modifications or (2) at all. If so best to find out soon. But remember as long as the chair fits through doorways (24-26"") transfers can take place in any room so long as there is room for the Hoyer to travel. So you will want to measure the turning radius of the Hoyer in the largest room.  A shower chair cannot go over the threshold. Sometimes you can build up the floor or have a little ramp if there's running room for that. The ShowerBuddy has its own track so that's another option. There still has to be some floor space available in front of the shower and room for the ShowerBuddy to be pushed onto the track. There are diagrams with measurements on the ShowerBuddy site. There is a tub version but most PALS will use showers for warmth if nothing else. Think how cold you'd be in a bath if you were only half in it let alone how hard it would be to stay upright without a strong core.  Your dad should be switched to a BiPAP ASAP -- get your clinic on this. BiPAPs allow for much lower air pressure when breathing out which is critical in ALS and have other features that CPAPs don't.  There are nasal masks available that are prongs a kind of cup over the nose and a nylon parachute over the nose. Most people can find comfort with one or another. cpap.com offers free return insurance on many of its masks and offers a larger selection than most equipment vendors.  Ideally a PT OT or nurse at your dad's clinic can become a resource on some of this stuff.

We have been completely overwhelmed with the process of learning about this disease raising a toddler preparing for a second baby researching drug trials experimenting with supplements figuring out my husband's business figuring out finances responding to friends and family wanting to help all while figuring out our new purpose and adjusting to a completely different family life than we envisioned (can you tell by my list that my mind is a constant whirlwind every day? Ha!).  He's had speech difficulty since this summer and has some mild hand weakness but can otherwise function independently. So far the progress has seemed slow but we are pretty early in the diagnosis since it was caught so early. It's hard knowing how to take each day at a time when you know your time is limited. And how limited it really is is very much unknown. The whole aspect of this disease and the unknowns drives me crazy! And the lack of answers we seem to get from doctors is equally as frustrating. I have worked in the health care field for 13 years (in pediatrics) and I have never been more disappointed in the health care field than I am now.  We are absolutely devastated and terrified by this diagnosis as I am sure many of you understand. What I am most struggling with is how to find the right words to help keep my husband going each day. I have chosen to take the path of determination and hope the whole ""we can accept the diagnosis but we don't have to accept the prognosis."" I feel inspired by all the PALS and CALS fighting to pass laws to get access to drug trials and Brian Wallach and his organization are particularly an inspiration to me. I just don't know any other way to cope with this other than to fight and remain hopeful. And I know my husband has it in him to fight too but he is just in so much pain. I don't know how much space I should give him and for how long to give him that space. And when is the time to inspire him to keep going so we can enjoy the time we have as a family together even if it's not what he wanted? He's quite the perfectionist and very goal oriented. He is used to being successful. ALS changes everything about the way of life he is used to living. Lately I can tell the depression is setting in and the withdrawal is starting. I'm afraid of letting him get too far down that rabbit hole. Most days I try to listen cry with him and be understanding but today I had a little tough love session with him to try to snap him out of it and I'm already feeling guilty about it. What are some of the things you do or say to lift your PALS up when they were first diagnosed or on the hard days?   Thank you so much for your thoughts you all are an inspiration.

Just when one has adjusted to a new loss and gone through the changes and made the accommodations necessary and grieved over the loss a new one rears it’s head and the process starts all over. It is a constant battle to not be overwhelmed by it all. My pals and I make a valiant effort to find joy in little things and adjust but yet another loss this weekend has left me reeling. The weight of responsibility that falls on my shoulders to handle everything and knowing there are new changes that will need to be handled around the corner is so hard at times and my prayer every day is to be the great caregiver he deserves but sometimes the sadness and fear is so exhausting it’s so hard to not show it no one but you all understand.

Visualization/meditation? Or is it simply not possible and you do the best you can?  I'm not talking about activities for self-care here--that's pretty well covered.

42871,2018-10-17 00:00:00,Exhausted & Feeling Guilty,I am so exhausted. We have home health aids taking care of my PALS on weekdays as I still work full time. He has no use of his arms &amp; legs. I get home about 5:15 just in time to help Steve use his urinal. Then I use the lift to get him out of his hospital bed &amp; transfer him to his wheelchair so we can watch the news. I feed him supper do the dishes &amp; sit down for an hour until it's time to transfer him to the commode/shower chair so he can poop. Then it's a shower &amp; transfer to bed. We actually have a pretty good system for now.   Bed time is very frustrating. He gets his meds between 8 &amp; 9 pm depending on how things are going. His meds include two Melatonin and two diphenhydromine. I get the bi-pap on him get his arms &amp; legs just right the pillow to his liking. Then the fun starts. He wakes me up every 15 minutes or so to adjust something itch somewhere etc etc etc. Next thing I know it's 1 am and I have to be up at 6. I am so exhausted. Thankfully this does not happen every night but it does most nights. I get snippy angry feel sorry for myself then feel extremely GUILTY for having those feelings &amp; snapping at him. This goes thru my mind over &amp; over while I'm at work.   I know it's not all about me but this nasty disease sure takes it's toll on everyone.  Love you all. Hang in there!

48517,2021-05-23 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Would you say most families start renting/buying a van that can transport someone in a powerchair? Or do most families have their PALS stay at home? I've asked the nurse the same question about getting my dad in a car and it sounded like the solution to them was for the patient to stay home.   I believe our house might be too small for something like the shower buddy. I wonder if other people experience that too realizing their house wasn't built to be accessible? :/. The nurse told me that it's okay to do sponge baths for showers for now and to use the commode for the toilet.   Fortunately for us the power chair eval also includes a PT and OT coming to the house to see the layout like you said. I've asked my parents about this and also about the hoyer lift and they felt that it wasn't time to do it yet but I wish they started to think more in advance even if they might not need it right away.   Thank you for mentioning the bipap. Now I'm sure that its something that he should try right away since we had no luck with the cpap. I'm going to bring it up with the nurse.,True,Adviceseeker1,2021-05-15 00:00:00,12,CALS,2021-02-01 00:00:00,US,,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/
48517,2021-05-24 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,There is no reason to stay at home! Sounds like you need to find a new nurse to talk to. What clinic do you go to?  Again most transit systems are fully compatible with power chairs or you can rent a van for a day or weekend for longer excursions. Just like renting a car the rental firm will even drop it off for an extra fee.   It's certainly not too soon to ask your local ALSA chapter about a Hoyer loaner and they may be able to help with other needs as well. Some of them will send a nurse to the home to get acquainted and see what you might need and you can accomplish a lot via Facetime/Zoom/Skype walking your laptop or phone around so they can see the place.   The Shower Buddy stacks against a wall for storage -- the issue is how many feet you have in front of the shower. The track detaches once your dad is in the shower then reattaches to get him out. I'm pretty sure we only had a couple of feet in front of the threshold but look at their diagram.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/
48517,2021-05-28 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,I'm wondering if the nurse misunderstood my question. Maybe she was just recommending staying home to do video appointments. But I'll try to ask her again about general traveling.  Do all families with ALS eventually have to get a van that can fit in a power chair? I don't think my family uses public transit all that much. The hope right now is that my dad can still stand long enough to get into the car for now but I'm unsure about later on (we have a toyota highlander). I was thinking he can try using a transfer board with a car that is more leveled to the wheelchair (like the honda accord).  Oh a Hoyer loaner is a good idea that I didn't think of. That way if my parents aren't wanting it yet they can still give it back. I'll look into that. Our house and bathrooms are pretty small though. My parents might have to end up switching their bed to something smaller. I think change in environment is difficult especially for aging parents who are used to a certain way. I am also starting to speak more to the local ALS chapter.  The shower buddy sounds like a good idea. Is it something that you used with your family?,True,Adviceseeker1,2021-05-15 00:00:00,12,CALS,2021-02-01 00:00:00,US,,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/
48517,2021-05-28 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,"A transfer board would be a perilous approach. We started with my husband sitting on a rotating disk in the car to help get his legs closer to the door for a short time where I could sort of pull him up and out but that was a matter of months not years with no thought of a transfer board. And he was a fairly slow progressor.  No all families do not end up with a van. If you do look into it you will want to look at used as well as new options. ALS doesn't last forever.  We used walking (we walked and operated his chair) and transit. It's never too late to become a transit rider if there's transit available. If not some communities have additional paratransit options for people who use wheelchairs who are not near a regular bus or train stop.  Yes the ShowerBuddy extended my husband's showers for a year until he no longer had the core strength for it. We sold it to a person who had a stroke.   Your dad is going to need a hospital bed. That takes a couple of extra inches out from the wall when the head goes up and will need to be at least 36"" wide 80"" long. If he's tall 84"".  You may need to figure out if this home is suitable for your dad.

Edaravone/Radicava- I've read about a drug called Radicava for ALS. Is that something ALS patients have tried? I've also read that it is IV only and very expensive.  3.

43925,2019-03-17 00:00:00,How to best help my pALS in early stages?,Hopefully many will chime in here because there are so many ways to help and so many things.  I’m also leg onset. Here’s what helped me:  1. With leg onset it’s never too soon to think about your home’s accessibility and to remodel if needed. He will likely need a wheelchair at some point. So there needs to be an accessible entrance to the main living area of the home. Sometimes that requires building a ramp. Also consider replacing carpet in the main living area and bedroom with solid flooring.  2. Doorways should be widened to 32” or more. Offset hinges are a great way to add a couple inches to a doorway. Grab bars in the shower are helpful while he can still stand and has hand function.  3. Bathroom ideally should have a roll in shower but there have been other alternatives discussed here. A bidet toilet or bidet seat is helpful. I have a tall toilet with bidet seat and grab bars on both sides.  4. Anticipate needs and be proactive. E.g. remodeling early use of a power wheelchair (make use of your ALS loaner closet) early use of BiPAP.  5. As far as little things I have adaptive nail clippers but my CALS cuts my toenails. We have a dressing routine at the beginning and end of the day. I find it helpful to sit on the bed to dress as I can no longer stand safely. We had to reorganize my closet to make it easier to get to things.... a great opportunity to get rid of clothes that are no longer PALS-friendly.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/how-to-best-help-my-pals-in-early-stages.43925/
43925,2019-03-17 00:00:00,How to best help my pALS in early stages?,The first thing that might help is to sit down and determine (you may be able to do this just because you know him so well not necessarily ask him a list of questions) what he is getting the most enjoyment from and the biggest 'sense of himself' from.  Then what he enjoys least and lastly what is the hardest for him to do.  It's difficult when the things he enjoys most are the hardest but I'm thinking this way - If you can prioritise what he enjoys most and find ways to help him with what is hardest and relieve him of what he doesn't enjoy - then he will have the bulk of his energy to put into what he enjoys.  This is different for everyone - my Chris most loved cooking and his tractor when at home.  For example with the cooking at first he used aides and some of these aides he made (the kitchen looked like a hardware store!). Then I started helping with the prep - getting things out of the cupboards and opening packaging etc We bought a food processor and that helped a lot too. The things we did kept him cooking to some degree for much longer. Of course he hated the clean up so was very happy to give that to me to do right from the start :lol:  When he allowed me to dress him of a morning it was astounding to find out that it took at least half of his days allotment of energy just to dress and I could save that for him. I guess on that list you can also be thinking what is a pride thing - it was really hard for Chris to allow this the first time. Once he did he was so astounded that I could dress him within a minute or two when it had stretched to taking him 20 minutes.   Lastly you have to be able to keep changing this as progression happens and find a way to help him cope with the losses (as you try to cope with them it's not easy to watch nor your own losses as you can't do things you loved together).  It's kind of quite a personal thing as some PALS are happy to stop doing something early that is really important to another. Chris's last trip around on the tractor took 2 men to lift him on and then off it. He just drove up down and all around and the slashing pattern was quite bizarre!

47470,2020-12-10 00:00:00,How do you best support your PALS after diagnosis?,"Congratulations on your daughter-to-be. I'm sorry you are facing this. The second and confirmatory opinion is generally where the denial has to begin finding another home Jamie so his journey from a mental perspective can be said to have really started only last week. That is not too long and withdrawal may be part of his process toward acceptance or he may be a guy who will never do acceptance. In addition it may never actually be a ""fight"" for him as it is for you. Those differences are not necessarily as important as what he does with the rest of his life.  Tough love is generally nothing to be guilty about so long as it's still recognizable as love. Still it may be too soon to have an impact. My cliché is to live your lives till you can't but for a perfectionist that will require being able to see ""life"" as something other than what was planned. That is not a week-from-the-second-opinion proposition.  So from me the advice is to give him the space because I'm not sure ""inspiration"" to participate in things is transferable.

47470,2020-12-10 00:00:00,How do you best support your PALS after diagnosis?,Hi Laurie  This is fantastic advice and really well put. I can't tell you how meaningful it was to me.  What you are saying makes sense especially about the second opinion making another home for denial. In my mind we have been dealing with this diagnosis for the last 6 weeks but perhaps in his mind it's only been a week. Of course we both had a small hope the second opinion would result in something different but I didn't let that fantasy go too far with the fear of being hugely disappointed in the end.   We have talked about the individual difficulties and fears we both face. I know I'm not the one having to physically experience the things he is or having an expiration date put on my life along with the facing the possibility of not seeing my children grow up so I can't expect both of us to be feeling the same thing at the same time. But in a way the pain he is feeling I am feeling too. I would do anything to take away the pain he is going through right now. It's hard to describe. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  You make a good point about talking about our terms of agreement with this site. I think there's an unspoken agreement to not post anything that we haven't discussed with each other.

47470,2020-12-13 00:00:00,How do you best support your PALS after diagnosis?,Jamie  I'm sorry you are going through this. I was diagnosed earlier this year at age 49 and have a wife and 3 teenage boys. I will give you my thoughts as I read through your post. In my situation I am the one with ALS but perhaps hearing my perspective will be of some value. First you are right that much remains unknown about this disease including why people's journeys diverge so much. Often doctors just don't have answers for us which makes things frustrating! I feel like it's a series of related diseases instead of one disease.   Like your husband I am a perfectionist and goal-oriented so one thing I focused on like a laser early on was arranging everything in my life so that my family can carry on (as normally as possible) once I'm gone. This included estate planning tiding up -- and to some extent winding up -- parts of my businesses and writing detailed memos and letters to my family both for practical and sentimental purposes. I know this all sounds morbid   but the way I thought of it is that if I could get this stuff out of the way early it would reduce my already-high stress level and make it easier to focus on enjoying the years I DO HAVE with my family. I wouldn't be clouded with the constant worry of how they get along without me. It's also important to do anyway and gave me some satisfaction that I was just taking care of s---.   As to dealing with your husband's emotions I can only offer that for me it is important that my wife and kids stay strong for me. I don't want to see sobbing or sympathy. I want normalcy as much as can be expected of course. Same for other family and friends. Just treat me the same as before. If you normally rip on me don't stop now! Everyone in my orbit has generally complied for which I'm grateful. I think you were strong to do your 'tough love' session and personally I think that is important and sometimes needed. With respect to living with an expiration date stamped on you I say. . . everyone has this as we are all mortal. We pALS just have a smaller number of days than others. But just like everyone we don't know when our number will be called. So I agree with Laurie that you live your best life every day until you can't. And then you live as best as you can as long as you can. I realize that not all days are good with this crappy disease but if you can bring it back to that core principle it can make things better.  Hope this helps. There are lots of great people on this forum.,True,EricInLA,2019-10-20 00:00:00,188,PALS,2020-01-01 00:00:00,US,CA,Los Angeles,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/how-do-you-best-support-your-pals-after-diagnosis.47470/
47470,2020-12-18 00:00:00,How do you best support your PALS after diagnosis?,Jaime help him focus on the future one day at a time to keep him moving and planning. Stress is worse than the disease in the early stages after diagnosis. Setting and achieving goals is a good distraction from the stress. Estate Planning and health insurance plans for the 5 month gap before Medicare kicks in are good initial family goals. Hopefully the gap will be gone soon with a signature but the work will still secure insurance for the family (it is not wasted effort). I also set goals to travel with my wife and family as long as I could to see my daughter and son graduate from High School and now to see my daughter graduate from college (in 2022). I pick goals that are a few days to a few years out because you never know what the progression will be. If he mentions a need for occasional chemical help for the stress talk to your GP and Neurologist for a prescription (there are no hero's when it comes to combating early ALS stress).,True,Ed340hp,2015-06-28 00:00:00,114,PALS,2015-05-01 00:00:00,US,California,Long Beach,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/how-do-you-best-support-your-pals-after-diagnosis.47470/

45418,2019-11-24 00:00:00,Losses,No offence Al but CALS have a right to vent their valid feelings without being told to 'make the best of their situation'. I am certain these CALS here will make the best of their challenging circumstances and are doing so every single day. BUT they have a place here to feel safe to let out their feelings and simply be understood then back to the fray they go and make the best of.  Christmas means many different things to different people and for many people it is the worst and hardest time of year despite all the glitter and bright lights consumerism makes of it all.

45418,2019-11-24 00:00:00,Losses,I feel inclined to step in here as a moderator.  Yes this is a forum and a variety of opinions are welcomed and encouraged. However the CALS sub forum is set up as a place where CALS can feel safe to share their unique concerns. Some threads are more welcoming to both PALS and CALS and others are more sensitive and should be only for CALS. We have to use our judgment. I think the current thread “Losses” started out with the intent of being in the latter category but has now taken a different direction. Some posts have been deleted per request of the person who posted them. I am moving another to a new thread on holidays in order to keep the current thread reserved for CALS. When in doubt I think it’s best for threads in the CALS forum to be for CALS only unless otherwise specified.  There is a PALS subforum which is intended to be a safe place for PALS. I think we should try to respect these boundaries.

45259,2019-10-26 00:00:00,How do you release your alertness?,It really depends. I believe meditation and focusing on breathing was very helpful for me. However I did not expect of myself to be right next to a person suffering from relatively fast progressing ALS with all its physical manifestations and be able to drop it all as soon as I had the (imagined) opportunity to do so. This was hard. ALS is heartbreaking and part of what makes it hard is that it is so real and relentless and that it takes its toll on all. I tried to accept that too. Then I tried to let go of my expectations that I should be able to drop these experiences and just focus on breathing. I tried to focus on breathing while the experience of this disease gripped my heart. It is what it is... also when I had a minute to myself. Kindness from friends went a long way. Truly hope that that you will read something in the responses to your question that helps you along. ♥♥♥,True,ReginaS,2018-11-20 00:00:00,211,Lost a loved one,2018-02-01 00:00:00,US,VA,--,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/how-do-you-release-your-alertness.45259/
45259,2019-12-02 00:00:00,How do you release your alertness?,This is one of the worst parts for me. The constant vigilance and never being able to fully relax as the next 'request' is mere minutes away at any time. My brain hurts my heart hurts I have little patience. When I DO have a few minutes I honestly just stare off into space. If we have a fire going I put on headphones to block out all noise and stare into the fire. I repeat 'This Too Shall Pass' a million times and I pray. Lots and lots of praying. For patience for peace for relief. I also have bird feeders in the backyard and watching them for just a few minutes seems to bring a little release from the stress. Best wishes to you and yours.

I was a self-employed CPA so I was able to work from home while my staff held down the office. Money was tight and I was working on my doctorate and writing a business math textbook for a major publishing company. That's when I took up running. They both could be left alone for an hour so I would run. I remember running and praying that all would be well when I got back home. Both had DNRs but that gave me no peace.

I guess it is modesty but it makes it tough on the CALS. He has such little control over anything in his life that I have been granting him this request. I remember Mike posting on this forum that he tried to do whatever his wife (PALS) wanted and I have tried to do this for Frank.  Dldugan I love my husband and would never want him to feel that he is a burden to me and I am sure your family feels the same way.

43925,2019-03-17 00:00:00,How to best help my pALS in early stages?,For my partner first it was weakness in the right leg but hand and bulbar weakened close to the same time. Right side first and left side then too. Increasing weakness.  Here are some of the adjustments that we did: He used an AFO which provided some stability.  We moved into a 1 level home. (There is a basement but only I or guests go downstairs now.) At first he considered building an addition w. accessible bed and bathrooms but then dropped that plan as his ALS is progressing too fast and he would have little time to get use out of it.  He put night lights in all the bathrooms and hallways/rooms for safety where he needed it.  Once he was ready he had ramps installed.  Plastic cups w. handles. (Straws don't work for him.) Plastic utensils as they are lighter.  A walker w. a surface for his coffee cup and tablet was very helpful.  We had different kinds of walkers during different phases. He put one the other way round behind the toilet so he has something to hold on to. Seems to work better than the supports of the elevated toilet seat.  We changed a couple of the door knobs so that pALS could open them more easily. We lock/unlock front door w. our phones.  We used a long shoe horn and very stretchy socks.  We already had some grab bars and have a couple more now. PALS will say where he needs more support and friend comes over to install it.  Recently we switched to a shower transfer system.  When the wheelchair came we had the door to the bathroom widened and installed a 'barn door' as a wider door is too wide for the hallway. We also had the vanity taken out to make room for wheelchair turns. It would be great to have a roll-in shower but as ALS is going so fast the cost was too great.   We are super lucky as a friend of ours is a builder whose brother has a motor neuron disease too and his wife was an OT. My pALS and he will discuss what my pALS could use and then he puts it in place.,True,ReginaS,2018-11-20 00:00:00,211,Lost a loved one,2018-02-01 00:00:00,US,VA,--,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/how-to-best-help-my-pals-in-early-stages.43925/
43925,2019-03-17 00:00:00,How to best help my pALS in early stages?,There are two thing that made a difference for me early on.  The first was to stop work. I loved my work and felt that I had a special talent in the field I worked in. It became obvious that I could no longer work but giving it up was absolutely gut wrenching. I really think that it was the single hardest thing I have had to do since diagnosis.  With all that said removing the physical stress associated with my work really helped my body. It seemed to slow the progression down (though whether it did or not I can't really say for sure). It allowed me to find new things that were within my capacity to do. Those other things have given me great joy.  The second thing that made a big difference was getting a wheelchair. I was not emotionally ready when the doctor told me that I should start looking into a power wheelchair. One year after that conversation I decided to take a look at them and would up getting one. What a difference it has made.  Walking any distance was a tremendous chore. I could still do it but did not appreciate how much energy it took out of me to do so. Once I got the wheelchair I was like a new man. I could go and go and go. My poor wife struggled to keep up with me when we out for walks together.  Providing an environment where he is able to feel comfortable making tough choices like these might be the best thing you can do. Getting a wheelchair is a big step. It is an admission that a PALS requires assistance. It also means getting a wheelchair van (or committing to public transportation) along with considering what to do about making your home wheelchair accessible. It can be a hard step.  Making it easier for your PALS to make those hard decisions might be one of the best things you can do at the early stages.

43925,2019-03-18 00:00:00,How to best help my pALS in early stages?,Everyone has said it very well and given great suggestions. As you see the common themes are maintaining safety conserving energy and prioritizing choices. These changes are not easy to accept especially in the beginning.   It took me a long time to realize that when something was just a tiny bit hard that was the time to make a chsnge or find a work around. Continuing to struggle more and more until I had to change was just silly and wasted energy.   I do believe with Steve that continually pushing to the limits probably speeds things. The six months after my move were slower than the six months prior. And the changes in how I feel and function are actually a positive improvement. I don’t think I am stronger but I can do a little more of what I want. I think this is mostly due to not having to fight stairs.   An afo as mentioned above is a great help for safety and energy.

He is not good at helping himself because he hates ""making a fuss"" and the thought that people have to change what they are doing for him. So I have started being the buffer so that we change because of me assuming he needs/wants the change.   Thank you all for the suggestions -- I am compiling them in a doc. and will give them to him after I personalize it and let him think about what he wants to do. It's exhausting to be trouble-shooting all the time but I am getting better at knowing when to step in and hanging back. I've also gotten better at not trying to fix everything the moment it happens - a big change for me.

My hubby left yesterday for a trip with our son and I was nervous for him to go alone...A few things that I did that helped ease my nerves and also helped him/them (I think)  1) I enlisted my ""tribe"". I reached out to our friends to ask them if they could help research handicapped accessible places for them to go. People always want to know how to help and this was a good way to let them. And it saved me time.  2) I called the hotel and requested a barrier-free room (not just an accessible room). I had the manager email me that he was getting this room and forwarded it to him in case something happened when they checked in.   3) I called the airline and requested wheelchair assistance at the Airport. He texted me on the layover and said they had to change concourses and having someone wheel him there was ""nice"".  4) I emailed ahead to places I knew he was going to find out the best places for him to park enter etc. I forwarded him the emails so he had the info.   5) I made sure to consolidate all the packing in a large roller bag that my son could carry so that my husband did not have to deal with luggage.   6) I worried and worried and worried...and then I got a pic of them at the beach today with 2 big thumbs up.  That's all for now. I will continue to update after they get back and I start to figure out more ways to help him (and how to help him manage me helping!).  I had like 4 ugly cries yesterday which I think was just a release of all the emotion of this trip. He went to Spring Training baseball in FL - a thing he always wanted to do ""when he was old"".

DH and I went to a game in FL when he was starting to have trouble walking. We rented a transport chair which was delivered right to the hotel. They are lightweight and fold up to fit in a car trunk. I'm sure your son could handle pushing him in it. There is also always accessible seating available. It's usually a cordoned off flat area. The person in the wheelchair wheels in then an attendant will set up chairs for any accompanying people. He (or you) can call ahead.

The holidays bring grieving in its own right. We love Christmas and it is so hard not to mourn what Christmas meant when he was healthy.

43925,2019-03-23 00:00:00,How to best help my pALS in early stages?,Wow some awesome suggestions here! I second getting a wheelchair early to have on hand. It will enable both of you to get out and do things he might not feel he has the energy to do otherwise. My PALS wasn’t keen at first but we got a lightweight travel one and kept in the car to have on hand and it really was indispensable to help him conserve energy and do more.   Some thing I did when my PALS was at the stage of using a walker was to put higher legs on our couches. There was a point where he found getting up off of the couch became very difficult. I got the longer legs at the local hardware store. They only added a few inches but having it that bit higher made it possible for him to get off the couch on his own for much longer.  When my pals wasn’t able to lift a glass any longer I fashioned a cup holder from a flexible ikea lamp to hold his glass with a straw up in front of him so he could sit and sip coffees in the morning or a glass of wine at night. It made it possible for us to sit and have a relaxing drink together without me having to get up for his every sip and without him feeling he had to down his beverage quickly so he didn’t keep me standing. We still use it and it has more than anything given us that occasional glimpse of normal life- we can sit and have a coffee togeher almost like normal people.,True,Avocado,2017-10-08 00:00:00,44,CALS,2017-02-01 00:00:00,AUS,Western australia,Perth,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/how-to-best-help-my-pals-in-early-stages.43925/

My husband doesn't have much use of his arms. I realize that Medicare or insurance probably won't pay.  I have a medical condition that requires me to sleep through the night. We have a lot of expenses with our children at this point and we really can't afford to hire someone to stay through the night. Even if we hired someone ""off the street"" for $12/hour it would still cost $30000 in a year.  So I was wondering if anyone used one of these. Was it successful? Is it automatic? Is there a particular brand that you liked? Can it be used with a bipap? Can you use a pillow with it? Does the bed have to be flat in order for it to work?

42072,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Question about life if a cure is ever found.,It's been a while since I have checked in. Life for my son and myself as caregivers is almost unbearable. My PALS is totally paralyzed from neck down. He has a feeding tube and is on a ventilator. He seems a little more depressed lately. Still doesn't sleep well at night so my son and I are constantly getting up and down during the night so we never ever get enough sleep. We have no help. No secondary insurance no VA and no one wants to learn how to do breathing treatments cough assist etc. I get it. We can't work because he needs 24 hour care. Have run out of money and live solely off of my PALS SS disability (thank god he gets that). We do get $180 month in food stamps which has helped a lot. We don't qualify for anything more.  My sons life is passing him by. My PALS has been at this level for several years now. His friends are getting married having kids careers and having fun at 28 years old. I see my son getting annoyed and feeling that he doesn't have a future. I keep telling him to go get a job even if its PT but he says that it would be a death sentence to me by taking on 24/7 needs of my PALS.  Don't get me wrong. My son and I love our PALS but it is becoming more caregiver and less loved one. It is so difficult. We do this day in and day out and frankly I don't see much of a future for myself either. I don't see how this ends and I can't see my son and I doing this for 5 10 15 more years. We are exhausted!  He absolutely will not consider going to a home nor do we want him to.   He is holding out for a cure! Which leads me to my question. When they do cure ALS (and they will someday) will his body recover? Will the motor neurons repair themselves? I have tried to research this. I saw where with some other diseases the nerve endings break where there is no chance of repairing but in ALS nothing is broken so it may be possible to regenerate muscles.

40910,2018-03-04 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"I think I'm officially graduating from ""we're making the most of it while we can"" to ""Yep this really really sucks"".   It's been a tough few months with five ER visits and two hospital stays three cases of pneumonia and one of the flue. No Matt when you stop choking on every bite or sip it does not mean things got better. It means your body is so used to aspirating that it no longer reacts.  This afternoon we checked into the Durham VA MICU where Matt will be trached and vented tomorrow morning. I'm actually ready for it since that's what he wants to do. I certainly didn't want to do it as an emergency measure. Hopefully we will be home in a couple of days where we should have nursing help from the VA.  I must confess that I finally understand how it can take an hour or more to get a PALS tucked in for the night....and this is someone who spent the entire day in bed. Matt no longer has any functional use of his hands--they move a bit but they won't do anything for him. Scratch rub change the channel blow pick wipe.... If you've been there you know what I mean and if you're not there yet it's too soon to worry about it.  I'm no longer friendly at 3am. In fact it seems I'm downright ugly at 3am. I will schedule at least one overnight shift a week. Other shifts I think may start at 7am...so they can handle the morning routine and I can go back to bed in another room. In this we are extremely fortunate. I DO NOT function well without sleep. I mean 7 good hours of sleep. If I had to do this all by myself well I don't know how long either of us would survive. I think perhaps as my darling was burning up his muscles and strength and hastening his progression with all of our adventures and travels I was also burning up my reserves.   So a new phase of this adventure starts tomorrow. No more slipping out for pizza and leaving him alone for 20 minutes. Oh...never mind....he was told to stop eating by mouth two weeks ago so it's time for me to start that diet I've been putting off until he stopped eating. I do believe I will research diet services that send prepared food. Who wants to cook? I'd better do it soon--I've had nachos for dinner three times in the past week. That's not going to help anything!  I've been in a pretty deep funk for the past six months or so. This decline has been hard to take. I just haven't been able to find anything positive to share and I hate being a downer all the time. Now that the terrible event is upon us well I almost feel a sense of relief. How stupid does that sound? I can just see myself re-reading this a year from now and shaking my head at my foolishness. Or maybe it's just more self-preservation.   The RT here in the hospital just turned the alarms on the vent on. Crap. Why do I want to hear an apnea alarm when the vent self adjusts to handle the problem? Yeah--that might not stick once I""m home. I do need to learn about the other alarms however.  ok...off to get something for his headache. Every pain in his body need. s a different medication.

My mom has ALS or PLS the doctors cant seem to decide. It is progressing wildly. She is in a wheelchair has lost fine motor control in her hands and is having trouble with her speech and it has only been a year. We planned to have her move here to my city early next year along with my brother and we were all going to get a place together (including my 4 yo son and boyfriend). This would allow my boyfriend and I to work and my mom to finally quit working and get some disability. We would be making the money and paying the bills and working and my brother was going to take care of our mom while i was at work. Then I would take care of her nights and my days off. I just found out my brother plans to bail and move to another state with friends now that he knows hed have to actually do something for somebody else instead of just living off of her.   Im scared. I want to do everything for my mom. Shes amazing. How am I going to be there as much as she is going to need and still go to work? I dont even know how much more it will have progressed by then. She is all there mentally and God it is a beautiful mind. I eould never dream of putting her in an assisted living facility. I have to be there for her but how do I support my family financially if she needs me to be there?

42501,2018-08-26 00:00:00,Lateral rotation mattress,"Hi Tammy  I wouldn't jump into a high-tech mattress he may not need or tolerate.  Most PALS don't have one and even those who do may not sleep through the night. No mattress or bed assures that. If your priority is his sleeping through you are probably going to have to resort to pharmacology-- some combination carefully titrated to be the lowest effective one of MMJ benzos antidepressants at low doses sedating antihistamines etc.   Also don't overlook the importance of sleep hygiene just as for you or anyone -- hitting the sack at the right time played out with music TV or talking books if needed etc. the right temp humidification etc. In many climates a low-voltage heated mattress pad under or on top of the mattress can help relax the muscles and keep the body at a constant temperature.   If you're willing to spend some money on his sleep start with paying extra for a hospital bed with Trendelenburg/reverse Trendelenburg positioning for more comfort options -- way more related to pain/sleep than rotation for most PALS. And make sure the bed is long enough e.g. consider 84"" if he is 6-feet plus. Medicare will pay for its default options and you will be responsible for the rest.  Make sure the mattress is medical grade foam get a latex pillow he likes foam for his elbows/knees if needed pressure boots if he needs them. There is also a ROHO overlay on Amazon and more latex overlays than you can shake a stick at. All that will still likely cost less than a powered mattress.   In other words build the system he needs just like you'd build a sandwich knowing the best options may need mixing and matching over time -- don't walk into the shop and say ""Give me your most expensive sandwich that I can't make substitutions to.""

42501,2018-08-26 00:00:00,Lateral rotation mattress,An alternating air mattress is well worth looking into. It is difficult to know the best system as some PALS/CALS don't like the alternating air some don't like sleeping on ROHO or firm foam.   But figuring out the best probable mix and being able to switch and adjust to some degree is definitely the ideal. Do you have a PT or OT that can help you work on this?

42072,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Question about life if a cure is ever found.,No one can know. When asked this in more general terms Merit Cudkowicz of Mass General who is a leader in the ALS world said that there would be precedent as people with polio which is a motor neuron disease did recover oftenquite well.   She definitely did not say certainly people could recover just it was theoretically not completely impossible. I wouldn’t count on it personally,True,Nikki J,2012-03-22 00:00:00,11246,PALS,2014-04-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Boston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/question-about-life-if-a-cure-is-ever-found.42072/
42072,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Question about life if a cure is ever found.,Though nobody really knows the answer I think we can make some assumptions.  In ALS as motor neurons die they are eventually replaced by scar tissue or sclerosis. Areas of the brain and spinal cord that are scarred are not viable and therefore not likely to be able to be brought back to life. If the neurons can be treated while there is some inflammation but before they have fully scarred then there is hope they can be brought back. Current therapies. including the stem cell research with NurOwn is aimed at protecting neurons and maybe bringing back the ones that are not too far gone.  If we look at people with traumatic spinal cord injuries some regain some function but it’s very uncommon for someone to recover from a complete spinal cord injury  When a PALS is in a more advanced stage of his or her disease it’s likely most of the motor neurons have been replaced with scar tissue.  Atrophied muscles could theoretically regrow if the nerve supply is adequate.  So I would think that if a cure were available tomorrow the PALS who would benefit most would be those in the earlier stages of their disease.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/question-about-life-if-a-cure-is-ever-found.42072/

42072,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Question about life if a cure is ever found.,If I remember correctly—somebody please correct me as needed—there IS indeed something broken in ALS. In ALS motor neurons are destroyed in the brain from the inside of the neuron to the outside. So by the time the myelin insulating sheath is attacked the cell inside it has already begun to die. The cell death eventually becomes total disintegration of the inside of the neuron in the brain. Can it be repaired? Can it be replaced? Can another neuron take over its duties? Not yet.     I am not scientist or a doctor and I can’t even spell the words needed to describe nerve damage. So someone else can correct or expand on what I wrote.   Will you and your son survive? Yes. And thrive! This is proven and demonstrated. I personally know CALS who recovered and went on to remarry and travel the world. I personally know teens and 20-somethings who went on to enjoy life. My boys are in college now and thriving.    Some PALS have told me that they have some quality of life even after most of the body is paralyzed. I don’t know if anyone can get an opinion though from a person who has lost the capability to blink or twitch an eye muscle. Do they have any quality of life? I don’t know. I regularly exchange friendly emails with quad-paralyzed PALS who say they enjoy life quite a lot. Of course it takes a positive attitude to start with. In my experience however I think attitudes can be chemically induced. (It works for me.)    The money situation is a tough one. You might work with GoFundMe or reach out nationally for support. You might even persuade a Girl Scout Troop or a Soccer Team to go door-to-door. That works better than you might think.

42072,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Question about life if a cure is ever found.,Texans - I can so totally relate. My husband has been trached and vented since 2010. He is completely paralyzed except for some eye movement and lip movement. He has been in bed 24/7 for a few years now. I take care of him mostly on my own. My DS will be 31 in a few days. He was married 4.5 years ago to a lovely gal. They have their own home.  My DD will be 24 next month. She is currently in PT school. Before she left to attend her first year of PT she was terrified of leaving me alone with my DH. As a Christian myself I put all my trust in the Lord to get us all through. I insisted that she go as I have always tried to keep their lives as normal as possible. They will never truly be normal during this mess but I do my best.  DS has Friday’s off so he relives me that day to get my errands done. He also comes over 1-2 afternoons for a couple of hours. DD helps when she is home.  I have a huge thread “struggling” that I pour my heart out in here. I know if you skim through it you will totally relate.  As to them being healed if a cure came along I’m not sure that is possible. If so the recovery alone would be very long and arduous. I cannot even imagine what it would take to help them learn to walk again. The pain of resolving the contractures would be very difficult as well. And yes with God all things are possible. However maybe that healing is meant for heaven.  Hang in there I know you are an awesome CALS as is your son and your husband is very blessed to have you. At the same time I often wonder as you do if there will be any life left after this is over given the fact that with a vent who knows how long this might go on.

If you're okay with waking up every couple hours and only worry about your husband's mental health and your attitude towards you then a nighttime aide is the only (and possibly not feasible) solution I see.   Sleep deprivation is not a fun condition. I've seen young parents who looked like zombies and they volunteered to bring their alarm clock into the world and have hope that it will move out at 27.   Being sleep deprived AND remembered that your loved one will die every time you go into deep sleep will knock the life out of you in no time.  I can deal with my PALS fine as long as I get to sleep at night. Take that away from me and I'll turn into a savage pretty quickly.

If sleep deprivation is feeding the anger that's the first point of attack. That is/was a huge impact for many of us and I guarantee there's not a CALS here who hasn't regretted words spoken in fatigue. If he's not going to seek help otherwise should we not start with sleep?   So what is he waking up to do specifically? That's why I mentioned the chin strap pressure boots and foam blocks.  If you are not falling into deep sleep such that tiny irritants are waking you up you could try layering on a light dose (e.g. starting at 12.5mg) of a sedating antidepressant such as trazodone frequently used as a sleep aid when pain is adequately controlled.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/question-from-my-cals-husband.42211/

42211,2018-07-21 00:00:00,question from my cals husband,Sorry you are going through this. I regret losing my patience (due to sleep deprivation/frustration) and feel terrible. Hope you feel a bit of solace knowing that he likely isn't angry with you but angry and bitter because of what this terrible disease is/has taken from you both. The plans and hopes of you being together for decades more and the thoughts of how things should be instead of what they are...he is likely incredibly devastated (as I am) and is reacting with anger. Not sure this helps and you probably already know this. Just a titbit from the other side as it sucks so bad not being able to help/fix/deal with what is happening and not in anyone's control at all.,True,NinjaLady,2018-02-08 00:00:00,75,Lost a loved one,2017-04-01 00:00:00,CA,BC,City,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/question-from-my-cals-husband.42211/

41954,2018-06-18 00:00:00,Progressive use of the Trilogy bi-pap,It varies but many PALS end up spending all or most time on BiPAP and that may be sustained for months or years.   Because the FVC only measures the strength of certain muscles there is not a linear relationship between the FVC and how many hours on BiPAP nor does the FVC decline predictably stepwise. SVC and MEP are better indicators of respiratory impairment if they are decreasing but still not strictly prognostic.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/progressive-use-of-the-trilogy-bi-pap.41954/

I get the feeling that ALS Clinic personnel avoid the questions we have about what happens at end of life. Maybe not. Maybe it is because they don’t know how an individual will move through phases. My wife and I have both completed Physician Directives etc. and decided no invasive ventilation is desired.

If she’s choking on solid foods you may have to employ the Heimlich maneuver (look it up) though sometimes slapping the heel of your hand on her mid back (“back blows”) will also do the trick.

40910,2018-03-05 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Becky. Sent you a message but want to say here that you need to take some deep breaths. While there are vent alarms the ones on the trilogy are much less annoying than what you’ll face in the hospital.   If the one at home goes off a lot check the settings. Good chance the high pressure alarm is the culprit as long as the hose has not popped off. It can an does happen but is quite rare.   When Brian was first trached and venting they had the high pressure alarm set to low. Man that thing kept us up at night until we got the RT to the house and figured out the problem. If you get lots of alarms call the RT. You should not. Now Brian’s alarm is a rare thing.   Once Matt is used to the vent he should sleep through the night. We have our times when that was not true when Brian finally lost his voice but otherwise sleep is generally good unless he gets sick.   You are blessed to have the VA supporting you with nursing.   Know you are in my thoughts and prayers as is Matt. Not sure if he can email but I know Brian would definitely reply with answers if he ever feels the need.

I'd say that you are about to embark on a ""most unexpected journey""... but if the truth be told you're already on it. There are some very good ""stickies"" within the top of major sections the might provide you with some initial information. Knowledge will be helpful... sometimes for knowing what to do and at other times for knowing what not to do. Unfortunately there will be other times when you'll find yourself in some circle or maze that seems to have no proper direction or desired exit.   The best I can tell you is to be flexible. Take each day as it comes and do the best that you can. It says much about your character that you've elected to be your Mom's caregiver. It is not an easy task and will be full of times when you'll search out some dark corner to let some tears fall. But there will be many other times when you'll come to realize that you've just made your Mom smile or laugh again... or you've shared some special story that makes this a moment to last a lifetime... or you find some new way to do something that was thought impossible to again do.     I believed that I knew ""love"" and what it was all about. I've been on the ALS journey since Nov of 2012... and I've never loved felt love or experienced love as I have in these past several years. When you have successes I hope you'll come in here and share them. And when you feel lost also let us know so we can help keep you pointed in the right direction. Collectively we have experienced many many things. But we won't have all the answers either. But just perhaps something that one of us might post and say will give you an idea that becomes the seed that grows into the answer of the question you'd been struggling with.   If I could offer one parting thought it would be to ""trust in yourself"". From the little that you've already presented to us I think you're going to find your way... even if only a step at a time.

You need to take things one day and sometimes even just one minute at a time. Take some time to read a bunch of the stickies. Lots of great info there.  Make sure you check into any available help. Such as palliative care home health and whatever she might be eligible for. Reach out to the ALS Assoc in her area and find out what is available. The social workers there are invaluable with their information. They can guide you.   Don’t be afraid to get help with Mom. I know you want to do it all but you need help. Going it alone some of us have to at times but it’s definitely not recommended.  And come here ask as much as you like. We are all here to help each other.

42180,2018-07-16 00:00:00,Panicking...how do I do this?,Hi Lolli sorry to welcome you. Also sorry to hear about your brother bailing but truly better now than later. Maybe you can put all the numbers together with your boyfriend and mom and consider if you or your boyfriend whichever one earns the least can forego working outside the home so someone can stay with your mom factoring in her disability benefit. One or both of you could still do some freelancing.   Taking care of your son is no small task either but some people do manage both often with the help of their social network. Some people bail others step up. You will never know who's who until you make the situation known.   My guess with the progression you describe is that your mom is more likely dealing with ALS than PLS. And it's completely normal to be scared. Fear is only a problem when you don't act on it. Lay your plans make sure your mom's legal paperwork is done if not as yet and you've at least got a running start that makes you feel more confident even when you have to make a left turn later.

Perhaps your brother could pitch in with some funding to help pay for in-home care for your mom. Every little bit helps. The idea that PALS need highly skilled care is just not so. Local community colleges and vocational schools probably have students willing to gain experience for very little money.  Don't try to have all the answers at once. You need a good support system and you need to take care of yourself and your child. Maybe people at work can offer some advice on how to handle the care needs. I have a page on LotsaHelpingHands that gives people the opportunity to volunteer for ""activities"" such as taking me to the doctor grocery shopping running errands etc. Some of my friends have offered to help me when the time comes.

When my wife was diagnosed I stopped a lifetime of thinking about myself and started thinking about her for a change. What did she need?   Since death is inevitable I decided that my mission in life from now on is to make her final months to be as pain free and worry free as possible.   I quickly saw the toll on the family and realized that I had to work for them too.   ALS will inevitably destroy one life don't let it take yours too.   In a manner of speaking your son has detached. He's saving his own life. Maybe you can connect with him with that knowledge so he can be some part of this care-giving effort without sacrificing more than he can stand.,True,Atsugi,2011-01-11 00:00:00,5200,Lost a loved one,2010-12-01 00:00:00,US,FL,Orlando,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/panicking-how-do-i-do-this.42180/
42072,2018-07-03 00:00:00,Question about life if a cure is ever found.,First as there are always newbies here let me remind everyone that we support all spectrums of religious belief here including having none at all.  I agree that new treatments are most likely to benefit those with early disease.  Arlington you are in the classic Catch-22. But you are in a town with several academic programs and I do believe you could find moonlighters (nurses students PTs OTs RTs all of whom often work multiple gigs) for respite care whom you could pay with income from part-time work. When my son and I took care of my husband it was always more important for my son (who was 29 when he started his co-caregiving) to get out on occasion than for me. Then again my husband had a genetic disorder so I was used to caregiving pre-ALS.   Anyway if you think your son's at a breaking point he probably is and there's no point in comparing or second-guessing that. We all come into caregiving different people and we all leave it differently as well. So I'd just encourage you to keep being his mom and don't let him foreclose any options out of guilt (his or yours).

I went through a really ugly time when my dad was dying of cancer. My guess talking to researchers the whole push is to slow or if the research fairy is smiling on us stopping progression. I don't at this point see complete reversal as being a thing. If it were possible imagine the number of people lined up for reversal car accidents swimmers people with other neurological diseases and the organ donors who ride motorcycles. I'd be all over that.

42211,2018-07-22 00:00:00,question from my cals husband,Azgirl i have to again bring up the sleep issue. While every other night does help if he’s severely sleep deprived that doesn’t fix it. He needs at least a good solid week. I was there for a while and it got so bad I could not even go to the store I’d get panicky   While what he needs to do for you may only take a quick minute and it is something you definitely need that doesn’t mean he’s easily able to go right back to sleep. There are nights I toss and turn for a long time. Esp if it’s. Closer toward morning.   Believe me he doesn’t want to be a grump. I too have regretted harsh words. It’s very hard trying to “guess” what your loved one needs all while your heart is breaking seeing them and what this horrible disease has done to them.   One thing that has helped me is sleeping in the room next door. I can still hear but it’s definitely muted the noise from all the machines. Not sure of your sleeping arrangement or if something like that is possible. It was hard at first to move out of our bedroom but now my space is a bit of a sancturary for me. That happen about 5-6 years after venting.   As Wish has said hiring someone at night would be the best solution. However I know that isn’t always possible.   I did take Celexa for a few years and it definitely helped but it was also a very hard step to take.   I’ll be praying for you Both  Hugs,True,Narrowminded,2016-04-30 00:00:00,2740,Lost a loved one,2007-07-01 00:00:00,US,PA,Pittsburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/question-from-my-cals-husband.42211/

He's been practicing for over 37 years. (Check more about him and see his photo online.)   I am close to a similar clinic. In addition to proscribing needed medication they have the expertise and know how to get equipment you need before you need it. It's a multi-discipline approach with a clinic where you meet with social workers respiratory ALS Assoc.. individual etc for comprehensive managed care information. They measured me for ordered delivered and instructed me on the use of my electric wheelchair. (Covered by Medicare). I'm getting by with a Transport chair right now. The other is for near future use so I don't have to wait three months for the paperwork etc.   Regarding Riluzole (Rilutek) and Baclofen pills When you have the prescription call every pharmacy within easy driving distance. The cost difference for me if I paid cash: $1700.00 to $150.00 for the same number of pills. Sometimes meds. are cheaper for 3 months rather than 1. Ask!  Mayo Clinic online has helpful information too. Sometimes trained medical students volunteer to sit with a person for a couple hours as part of their practicum. No sitter is permitted to touch or treat patients. Registered nurses can though.   This may give you enough information to get started.

41954,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Progressive use of the Trilogy bi-pap,My dad started with Trilogy just at night and progressed to full-time use. For a while he could go up to a few minutes at a time (during showers) without the mask but now can't go more than 15 seconds or so without it.  He decided against invasive (tracheotomy) ventilation but it's hard to say which would have been better. We have to rotate through three different masks - two during the day and a different one at night - to avoid pressure sores and skin irritation.   He uses an eye tracker to control his computer but isn't always able to operate it very well. Some days he can't even blink properly. We worry about what happens when he's no longer able to communicate with us at all.  The studies I've read seem to suggest that the average survival is around 300 days after starting full-time noninvasive ventilation.

41954,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Progressive use of the Trilogy bi-pap,This thread has been helpful to me especially seeing it from the perspective of Bruce and Arizona gal who use Trilogy 24/7 and still get out and about with their wheelchairs.  I wanted to address Ernie’s (Chincoteaguer) concern:   “She has no noticeable problem breathing without it which makes it hard to convince her to use it.”   I decided early on against invasive ventilation. When it came to deciding whether I would accept BiPAP/ Trilogy I chose to accept it when needed because it is noninvasive and can improve my quality of life as well as conserve energy related to work of breathing.   I also read somewhere that some PALS without it would panic as their respiratory muscles failed and would feel as if they were suffocating sometimes even fearing to go to sleep. Then I read that this sense of panic could be mitigated by noninvasive ventilation. That had me convinced.  I recently started BiPAP at least 4 hours a night mainly to see if it would help headaches but also to reduce work of breathing. I don’t really feel I need it at this point. I have noticed that when the mask is sealing properly and everything is set up right that there is a calming effect.

42442,2018-08-17 00:00:00,Introduction,Hi everyone  This is my first post. My father was diagnosed with ALS at the end of June. He is 73-years-old and the whole family has been in shock because nobody had any clue something this devastating was going on with his health. This was truly a shock to the system.  Of course we are still reeling emotionally but one of our biggest concerns right now is how we will afford his care. He has been told he does not qualify for SSDI. Nor does he qualify for Medicaid. As a result we are left with the depressing possibility that caring for him will bankrupt him and therefore my mother.   Does anyone have any advice about the financial side of this diagnosis? Social workers from Eldercare and the ALS Society have only been able to tell him what he won't qualify for so far.  Thanks for reading.

42291,2018-07-30 00:00:00,Dad has ALS,Re: Do I HAVE ALS ?   Najib very sorry about your dad. It would be very very unusual for you to get ALS at pretty much the same time as your dad and a lot of us have differences between hands and twitches from time to time. You are under considerable stress as you say and that can cause twitches as well. I would also guess you are not eating as well as you have in the past.   I don't see anything concerning in your photos but it would be much more important if you found yourself unable to perform specific activities like lifting reaching and holding things.  I also have to be honest -- if Rilutek is costing you a lot and it's money that's almost beyond your reach I would not worry about it. The benefit for most people who had symptoms for a year starting in the limbs and who is not terribly old is not established statistically.   I would instead spend that money or whatever you have to spend on future supplies that will make your dad more comfortable. At some point he will most likely need a BiPAP and perhaps a feeding tube to go on. Is he able to breathe and swallow well right now?   We will support you however we can.

41221,2018-04-13 00:00:00,Drained,Looks like I may be getting some help at least one afternoon a week hopefully two fingers crossed my DH isn't really on board with this but I don't know how to do it 24/7 without a little help.   Once again I have well intentioned friends telling me I need to take care of myself but even with help there is so much to manage and no one else can/will do that part of it as you well know. It is so difficult for people to understand when someone can't do anything for themselves how time consuming it is to do it all for them. When I get a rare spare moment all I want to do is rest. Friends tell me I need to get out more and they miss the 'old' me but I am so exhausted that faking being happy is just too much. Recently when someone complained I was turning down invitations I just burst into tears. Are they kidding? Really? I have a broken foot! Not to mention I would have to arrange coverage for my pals. Someone actually dropped off some DVDs of a television show I could 'binge watch'. The last thing I want to do is watch more television as it is on a lot already for my husband and even if I did who has time to binge watch tv? I know they mean well but I don't need the added guilt that I am handling this wrong. What do they think I am doing all day? I have been very proactive so far and one of the reps from an agencies who visited confirmed that. This might be controversial but I think the hi profile pals we see in the media who have a lot of help give a false impression of what this disease is really like for the rest of us. One friend told me of someone they know who had a private plane and was living life to the fullest with ALS like its glamorous or something sorry for the rant feeling bitter today I guess.,True,ARCG,2016-10-12 00:00:00,204,Lost a loved one,2015-01-01 00:00:00,US,TX,Houston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/drained.41221/

48670,2021-07-11 00:00:00,Toileting help/Sling advice,So here's an update Lot's going on on many fronts. I am dealing with the company that sold me the wrong sized sling.  JimInVA very kindly and generously gave/loaned me his size large.  Which is a big big help. I may end up buying a new one but it is so helpful that I can actually try it first to see if it is right for us. I hope that with my limited but increasing knowledge and sling collection I can be of help to others in the future.  So I think this can really work. (The Liko Highback Hygiene Sling/Vest) Keeping his posture upright while trying to seat him on the toilet is essential. There is a learning curve. There is the issue of getting the pants on and off which takes practice and experimentation but we are definitely making progress. Meanwhile our overnight caregiver is quitting on us and we are trying to train someone new while still learning it ourselves. Oh and the Hoyer lift is making frightening noises while lifting so I am dealing with the same company to get help with that. I guess this is just par for the course in this world of ALS. I am sure many of you can relate.,True,Ruth33,2020-06-15 00:00:00,22,CALS,2019-11-01 00:00:00,US,MD,Baltimore,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/toileting-help-sling-advice.48670/page-2

48670,2021-07-12 00:00:00,Toileting help/Sling advice,Ruth  If it helps any here's what I did with my husband. Position the leg pieces high on the thigh a little below his butt. Lift via the hoyer and pull the pants down as much as possible while he's suspended in the air. Move to the toilet/PWC then sit him down. Detach the sling then lift a leg at a time to get pants down/off if needed. It takes some patience and practice but becomes so much easier than any other sling we tried. (None of the OTs we worked with had any idea that a sling like this even existed. For the most part the OTs were no help at all with toileting. Thank God for this forum!) My husband was tall so we also had to get a hoyer with a higher lift height than most. Luckily our local ALS Loan closet had a power one that fit the bill.   Good luck - you can do this!    P.S. - We only used the toilet when he needed a bowel movement. Otherwise a urinal (I liked one called a Uri-bag) was the way to go.,True,Jrzygrl,2017-02-14 00:00:00,720,Lost a loved one,2014-08-01 00:00:00,US,NJ,X,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/toileting-help-sling-advice.48670/page-2
48670,2021-07-12 00:00:00,Toileting help/Sling advice,Hi Ruth  I am puzzled as to why you have to pull his pants up and down. Using the U sling with back flap (open bottom) pants should work. With them you don't have to pull the pants down to use the toilet so there is no need to pull them back up. Just use the Hoyer to move over the toilet commode or bedpan. I have my pants put on in bed in the morning which requires being turned side to side but they can also be put on once up and in the wheelchair.,True,Diane H,2013-09-28 00:00:00,645,PALS,1985-11-01 00:00:00,US,IN,Fort Wayne,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/toileting-help-sling-advice.48670/page-2
42117,2018-07-09 00:00:00,Feeling guilty,I don’t think it is wrong to wish for it to be over. Your mother is suffering. If she is constantly coughing and has bed sores she is not entirely comfortable.  Unfortunately our society makes us feel guilty if we don’t want people to live forever. I think we need to do everything we can to help people be as comfortable as possible in their end stages. We need to know when to let go. We need to realize the point at which more aggressive intervention is likely to prove futile. I believe quality is more important than quantity when it comes to life.  My advice with your mother is to let her know you love her. Keep doing your best to ensure her comfort. But also let her know it is ok for her to let go when she is ready and that you will be ok. No reason to feel guilty.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/feeling-guilty.42117/

Have you tried some of the remedies for phlegm that we have discussed in other threads from pineapple juice to Alka-Seltzer by tube or mouth? Does she have an overlay on her hospital bed? Does she transfer out of bed at all? There are many ways that she might be more comfortable and you are right that no one should suffer.  It's also very common to wonder when her suffering and your burden will end. Trying your best to ease her passage and help her do or experience what is still precious undone or unsaid will relieve you of any possible guilt when she does pass on and that is your last best gift to her and yourself.   As you say you are helping her every day but it is not for karma points. You can love someone and still want the suffering to end. Depending on what conversations your mom has had with you in the past and/or what she is communicating now what advance directives are in force and what conversations you have had with the hospice nurses if your mom herself is ""done"" that is a conversation that you are always free to have with the hospice staff -- that the two of you want to err on the side of comfort rather than length of life.

There may be a 5 month waiting period to qualify for benefits dated from the time disability was established. They will arrange an interview and request medical records pertaining to the ALS diagnosis. It also helps to go to the social security website and fill out the SSD application online.

But alone well I looked after him alone so alone the beast that is ALS/FTD takes over so many of the memories still. I guess that is why they stayed away and told me several times how glad they were that he had me to take care of him.

42344,2018-08-07 00:00:00,A Sad Day,I realize this thread is in the caregivers forum. However it raises important ideas for me as a PALS. I thought I’d share my perspective.  ALS is a series of functional losses each triggering an emotional reaction. As one more or less adapts to the functional loss activities one could do previously but not presently seem like they occurred in another life. The contrast is sad.  ALS is a family disease. CALS not only have to deal with their PALS functional losses and emotional reaction they also have their own emotional reaction. Plus there’s the ever-present undercurrent that their loved one is going to die from this experience.  It’s sad for me to think of all the things I could do a year ago or even a couple months ago that I can’t do now. I vacillate between feeling nostalgic and feeling downright sad and angry. My CALS tells me she grieves for the future which is not the one we had planned.  One thing that’s kind of helping me remember my past life and tip the scales a bit more towards nostalgia is that I’m starting to journal aspects of my life with the idea of possibly assembling it into a book. This will also be a memoir for my CALS to have when she can’t remember our pre-ALS life.

41221,2018-04-23 00:00:00,Drained,I was fortunate that my husband had always liked to go to bed early. The first thing I would do after he was settled is spend around an half an hour thinking about what we needed for the new or next stage of loss and what I needed to do the next day towards that end. I would write out a schedule for the next day and a list of the to do items. I would then to the best of my ability  spend an hour or more relaxing knowing I had done all I could for that day. I would then go to bed. I found this really helped reduce my mind racing once I got in bed.

He doesn't see the point as when he gets tired he progresses quicker and doesn't recover. Are you all still going to clinic?

The back is covered by flaps that overlap to keep your lower back covered but don't get in the way on the toilet. The pros far outweigh the single con of not wearing underwear under them. Underwear is not recommended for people in wheelchairs anyway—it adds seams that can cause pressure sores. Instead put a hand towel on your cushion (long side front to back) and sit on that. In addition to being comfortable absorbent easy to change and wash each day a towel can be pulled from behind your back to scoot you up in your chair. The pros are: Easy dressing. No hard tugging required. Super easy transfers to the toilet and back again whether you do a standing transfer or use a sling and lift. The open bottom means your slacks don't have to be tugged down and then up again. Just lift and sit! The opening keeps the slacks well out of the line of fire and makes wiping easy. {""lightbox_close"": ""Close""""lightbox_next"": ""Next""""lightbox_previous"": ""Previous""""lightbox_error"": ""The requested content cannot be loaded.

48670,2021-07-19 00:00:00,Toileting help/Sling advice,Thanks everyone.  The problem with the back flap for us is my husband is not ready to give up underpants. And the fabric was too heavy for summer. I did find some pants called carezips that have zippers part way down the sides and another zipper across the crotch for using a urinal. They are a nice looking fabric look like they will wash well have wide legs elastic waist (of course) and are easy to maneuver much better than the sweatpants he had been wearing. Jim tipped me they should be loose which is great advice. Getting the pants (and underpants) down with the hygiene sling is relatively easy. I just pull them down part way while in the sling and the rest of the way by lifting his legs while on the toilet.  I am trying different methods for pulling the pants up and it is getting easier. 1. pulling/bunching the pants all the way up above the leg straps of the sling. 2. putting the leg straps inside the pants and then unzipping the sides once he is back in the PWC to get the straps out. We have made a lot of progress and it is working. No more pivot transfers and no more standing for us.,True,Ruth33,2020-06-15 00:00:00,22,CALS,2019-11-01 00:00:00,US,MD,Baltimore,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/toileting-help-sling-advice.48670/page-2

48517,2021-06-03 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,"Bowel problems usually include constipation at some stage but the opposite as well. That can relate to the combination of diet (including tube feeds) and which muscles are overly weak. Various combinations of dietary changes fiber and/or laxatives may help.  A ""regular"" power hospital bed will be covered at the same rate as other DME including suction machines. His doc can write an order for these and other equipment needs. For the bed if you can pay the difference a reverse Trendelenburg feature ""cardiac chair"" is advised as it helps with urinal use to have the whole bed tilted down. If the PALS is taller than 6 ft. or so an 84"" bed may work better.   Search on Radicava up top and you can read threads about it. Insurance does not always cover it. It does not benefit all PALS.  Overnight caregiver tasks usually include repositioning for comfort including the use of foam supports for joints adjusting bedding or room temperature adjusting the BiPAP toileting when needed. But once a PALS needs BiPAP and cannot adjust it themselves or is at risk for choking on mucus and/or saliva it is a matter of safety for a caregiver to be with them whatever the time of day.",False,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/page-2

43944,2019-03-22 00:00:00,Thoughts on When to Get Hospice,"My PALS and I have decided to use hospice when the time is right. He uses a Trilogy about 17 hours a day does not want to be trached or have a PEG. He is able to eat whatever he wants (with the help of water to wash it down) he transfers from scooter to chair/commode but anything he does is exhausting. His FVC in February was 26% MIP 20 and MEP 32. In April of 2018 his FVC was 52% and has seen a pretty consistent decline since then. He feels his breathing has declined since Clinic in February and finds he needs the Trilogy after anything physical such as eating showering and going to the bathroom. We are in the ""funding"" stage of a PWC an adjustable bed would be helpful and I would like some training on transfers. In a sentence he is still mobile but his breathing is very labored. In fact even with the Trilogy it is difficult for him to lay on his left side. He hasn't had any chest congestion but does have nasal drainage. He can speak about 5 words before taking a breath and uses Cough Assist 3 times a day.  We are without a Clinic pulmonologist but our local pulmonologist (who is also certified in critical care) suggested that we start the hospice process of interviewing programs getting an evaluation and when the time is right for us start hospice.  I can see pros and cons at this time. It is comforting to me when I think I would have support when breathing distress comes or when needing advice and help with issues that arise. I also know it would change our current routine and with my PALS still able to transfer and do some things on his own we may give up some autonomy and privacy.  I know everyone is different but I would cherish any personal thoughts on this decision especially from those who have dealt with breathing issues as a primary concern.

It is set up with a head array so he can drive it and a joystick in the back so I can drive it. Unfortunately his neck has gotten so weak he is not able to use the head array. There goes a little independence.   He has no use of arms legs and his trunk is very weak as well as his neck. Eating is a scary process as swallowing has become difficult. He does not want a PEG. He has a VC of 31% and does not want a vent. This is all in his advance directive..  He has decided he will quit eating and drinking when he feels it is time. While it is heartbreaking I will abide by his wishes. Our children are also honoring his wishes and not trying to talk him into something he does not want.

48517,2021-06-03 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,"Our ALS group (ALSinfo dot org) helped out in a number of ways. They had introduced themselves to us by sending out our contact person Jeri. She came to the house and looked around and asked if there was anything she could help us with at that moment. At first we felt well attended to. We had a PWC a hoyer lift a Trilogy BiPAP a CoughAssist and a Saliva/Mucous suction machine. Darcey had lost most all mobility in bed and we'd just gotten her an electric hospital bed.  As Darcey's in bed mobility decreased she wasn't able to turn in bed on her own. So every 60 to 90 minutes she'd wake me to move her. As days began to stretch into multiple weeks I was becoming more and more exhausted due to the lack of uninterrupted sleep. So I mentioned it to Jeri who said ""I've got a solution for you. Let me see what I can find in the loaner closet."" A few days later they delivered an 8"" low pressure alternating air mattress to go on the bed (replacing the existing thin mattress). From that very first night Darcey slept through the night without waking and needing to be turned from one side to another. Obviously I was able to once again sleep too. I can't even begin to describe how important it is for both parties to get good sleep.  Later they helped with some issues we had with condensation happening at night in her BiPAP hoses. When fulltime use of a hoyer was necessary they loaned us a new hoyer lift for upstairs (we used a stair lift for several years to get to our upstairs bedroom) to make my life easier. And as Darcey's voice began to wane they worked with a technology company to get us an Eyegaze device ON LOAN so that Darcey could continue to use the computer and keep herself occupied each day.  And when Darcey was no longer able to call me in the middle of the night (she could not talk anymore with her full face mask on) explaining my dilemma to Jeri resulted in hearing from a special technology expert who provided an infrared system that would detect movement of her eyebrow... sounding an alarm that would bring me running from upstairs to downstairs where she than slept each night.

48517,2021-06-17 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Thank you again for sharing all this info.  Very emotionally and physically tired right now and haven't had time to post on here.  My family has had a rough past few weeks. My dad had to go to the ER. He told me to call 911 because he couldn't breathe and passed out but thankfully the EMT got him some oxygen and he woke up again. He also told me that he had a bowel movement that allowed him to breathe again. I suspect that his stomach bloating caused gas and that buildup affected his weak diaphragm muscles. The doctors also treated him for suspected pneumonia.  He had a brief visit to a SNF for rehab but we took him home the same day because the care over there was really bad. I'm glad that we did not leave him there. The next day he had the breathing issue and this time we were able to bring him to the hospital ourselves without calling 911 because he was more stable.  After the 2nd trip to the hospital we brought him back home now with equipment including hospital bed hoyer lift and oxygen. We're still learning to adjust and my mom has used leave from work to take care of him.  It seems like he is starting require more attention and we get up in the middle of the night multiple times to help him and it's exhausting for all of us even though we try to take turns.  Questions for you guys how did you manage the over night care and did you end up leaving your work to take of your family member? I'm planning to research about in-home care but I'm scared to find out that it will just be too expensive for us.,True,Adviceseeker1,2021-05-15 00:00:00,12,CALS,2021-02-01 00:00:00,US,,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/page-2
48517,2021-06-17 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Usually he would be using a BiPAP instead of oxygen which especially without BiPAP generally accelerates progression by increasing CO2 buildup. I would ask the team about that. Remember the CPAP you mentioned is not a good idea in ALS and may contribute to his breathing issues.  Most of us if it was just one person and a PALS could not work full-time even at home because as you say much care is required and sleep can be hard to attain. If there are two+ of you maybe you could work out a rotating schedule for some of you to work full/part-time.   As for having home care especially overnight that might even pencil out if some of you can fund it through being able to work. So long as you guys are around for emergencies you should be able to find a fairly low-level caregiver (i.e. not as expensive as a nurse or anything like that) who can address his needs during the night in terms of using a urinal repositioning adding/removing covers adjusting his BiPAP mask etc.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/page-2

I like watching the meditation lectures. I've gone through the philosophy/religion courses and am now learning Spanish. They have courses on just about everything. It's definitely worth the cost and has provided me with hours of entertainment.  The lectures are about 30 minutes and approximately 18-30 lectures in each course. You can skip around.

Dots is addictive.

If anyone is using an iPad spring for the ones that cost a few bucks with no ads. They are much better than most of the freebies.  Another thing that might entertain PALS is to have an Apple TV (about $100) hooked up to your regular TV so you can mirror your iPad onto your TV and play group games.

43877,2019-03-10 00:00:00,New caregiver,Sad to welcome you Stacy. In terms of free respite care that is most often provided by your ALSA chapter. Have you been in touch about that? Not all chapters have such a program but some do.  Depending on your income there may be also programs open to you through your local senior/disability city or county department. It never hurts to ask.   The only equipment we were lent was a power wheelchair and Hoyer lift and while they may have been dusty when we got them I don't think they were biohazards and in fairness they wouldn't be high risk items in that respect to start with. But FYI typically the DME that is working with the ALSA or MDA to lend equipment does it on a volunteer or token fee basis so likely they are putting minimum time into prep.

So much love and understanding.   Our ALS loan pool has been very generous with anything we need for my husband. I have noticed some of the equipment isn't as clean as I would have hoped. Like Laurie says the DME people may not put in a lot of prep time. You may want to reach out to friends and relatives to help you with cleaning up equipment as it arrives and other chores around the house. For sure check out local programs that may offer assistance.   One other thing...our ALSA has support group meetings once a month. The closest to us is an hour away but well worth the trip. We usually break up into CALS and PALS group each having a facilitator from ALSA. Check with your ALSA to see if they provide meetings. It's good to get things off your chest without feeling judged just like this forum.

43877,2019-03-12 00:00:00,New caregiver,Stacy sorry to have to welcome you here.  I am a PALS. My spouse/ CALS is also a retired RN. I’m a retired MD. I think my spouse and I can relate to the dynamics you and your husband are experiencing.  My spouse and I had a pretty equal relationship before ALS though there were definitely areas where I made the major decisions.  ALS totally changes the dynamics of a relationship. Suddenly the CALS must make many of the decisions and certainly has to do more and more of the physical tasks. The PALS has to adjust to not having as much power and possibly doing a lot of “back seat driving” which can come across as nagging.  It’s important to realize that neither of you are responsible for bringing on this disease. The anger and chaos that comes about with ALS is a “gift” from this monster and really part of the grieving process.  Communication is key and counseling if needed. You’re obviously both good people who didn’t deserve this. Nobody does. Go easy on yourselves.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/new-caregiver.43877/
43877,2019-03-12 00:00:00,New caregiver,I am a newish cALS myself (husband was dx this past Dec.). My husband and I were pretty ind. before ALS too. It's been an adjustment. Key is to talk about how you are feeling and to let him talk too. While he is the patient and needs care -- this is happening to both of you just in different ways -- you are both suffering and I'm so sorry. You both will have different needs as you figure out your new roles. I am constantly surprised that we can react to the same set-back (or whatever) in totally different ways.   Reach out to various non-profits to see if they can help with equipment and I can't stress this enough reach out to your government officials for help - local state and federal to see if they can assist you. Tell them your husband has ALS and ask for help...you may be surprised at what is there or how they may help you. Once people hear ALS they are usually compassionate and kind and try to do at least something to ease the burden.   Also the problems that existed between the two of you (if there were any) will still be there. The key is to forgive yourself and to find what works for you let him know and hope that he shares what he needs and is going through. I've gotten better at living through the suffering moments -- they pass.   You may be able to get some help/counseling on the phone if travelling is an issue but you need to know that you are not alone.

49303,2021-10-16 00:00:00,New Caregiver,At the end of the day all these things are his decision and many PALS choose no NIV and no G tube. All you can do is give him the information and then advocate for the choices he wishes to make.  I don't believe as a CALS we can have any idea what this is like for our PALS no matter how much time we spend with them or how much we do for or with them. This is not something that you can fight and win.  It may be worth simply making the most of what time you have with him letting him know you will advocate for him and acknowledge that the only control he has is to make these kinds of decisions.  My husband made many decisions I did not personally agree with but I advocated for these things for him (he couldn't speak).  Would he have lived longer if I had made decisions for him or insisted on talking him into decisions I wanted? Maybe but then we can't say that for sure it's not that simple. Would my husband have enjoyed any extra time had I done that? I'm certain he would not have as he would have felt he had no control and resented me doing that.  Be careful deciding things like 'he doesn't want to allow himself to be happy'. ALS is the worst thing I could imagine dealing with and he is really newly diagnosed too.   Just love him and support him. Maybe he will decide differently but maybe he will won't and all that will go far better if he knows his loved ones support whatever he chooses.

But if he understands what is involved and the consequences and says no anyway and means it that is the path you will need to travel with him. I would just have the conversation(s) that if he is rejecting life-extending interventions then it really is time to ask his doctor about writing an order for hospice or supporting the end of life outside the hospice framework.

It is possible he could be very scared and find the information overwhelming and try to hide in a degree of denial. The decisions can all be hard ones as it isn't like you can make decisions that will cure him but you can help improve his quality of life significantly.

43906,2019-03-14 00:00:00,Breathing regular checks,I let my partner be in charge of his Drs appointments - they take energy that he often would like for other things. He usually goes with his dr's recommendations. My impression is when the Drs in the ALS clinic see a slow decline they schedule appointments further apart ( like 6 months - that's not uncommon here) and when the decline is faster the next appointment is in 2-3 months.   A year ago his breathing was great 6 months ago it was FVC 70% and in January it was at 44%. He did not need a test to know that things had gotten worse. We got a trilogy then. He is now slowly getting used to it - thanks to Laurie from this forum here who helped us find better settings for him.   For us tests put numbers on things that he knows already and tells me about. He wants to stay away from life extending measures so he was not keen on starting BiPAP early - it's supposed to have benefits when started early. We did not even know that at the time. Rather than starting BiPAP early he wanted to be as free as he could be without being hooked up to any machine or tubes.   He noticed that his breathing had gotten worse when he was not able to breathe comfortably while lying on his back. He also noticed that the airways in his head are 'closing' when his head or neck are in certain positions. He changes his position and adjusts to the changes as best as is possible. So far this still works for him.,True,ReginaS,2018-11-20 00:00:00,211,Lost a loved one,2018-02-01 00:00:00,US,VA,--,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/breathing-regular-checks.43906/
43906,2019-03-14 00:00:00,Breathing regular checks,7 months may be ok and he could certainly request that he be checked sooner if he notices a change in his breathing.  The problem with that is that changes are often subtle. Sometimes weakening of respiratory muscles may be manifested by development of headaches or increased fatigue rather than by noticeable difficulty breathing.  There’s increasing evidence that early implementation of BiPAP can extend life and certainly quality of life in ALS by reducing work of breathing even if the PALS is unaware of shortness of breath.  So the answer is complex and partly depends on goals. If the PALS desires to slow progression and conserve energy then more frequent monitoring may be indicated. Not all PALS choose to use BiPAP.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/breathing-regular-checks.43906/
43906,2019-03-15 00:00:00,Breathing regular checks,My dad is completely open for an early implementation of BiPAP and would definitively choose it if it were needed or recommended. However so far he has not complained about breathing and his FVC remains above 100% (other measures are good too).   I guess we will wait and see how it goes. We will keep this appointment but if there is any sign that his breathing is worsening we might ask for an earlier visit... I hope the things stay like this: the doctor yesterday was very surprised about the test -he told my dad that with respect to breathing he was just like a healthy man of his age.,True,Emanol,2018-04-03 00:00:00,67,Loved one DX,2017-09-01 00:00:00,SP,NY,Lugo,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/breathing-regular-checks.43906/
43906,2019-03-15 00:00:00,Breathing regular checks,I just went to clinic visits every 6 months. As a slow progresser my neurologist and I agreed that every 6 months is enough. With breathing being the life ending symptom and no changes over the past while he doesn't need the hassle or exposure to sick people by going to the hospital. This is good news. I am assuming he can call and be seen quicker if things start to go faster.

43944,2019-03-22 00:00:00,Thoughts on When to Get Hospice,"Our situation is a bit different but maybe some of my experiences might be interesting for Katygal. PALS' breathing is the only thing that's still somewhat OK but swallowing is hard and movement w. arms/fingers and legs is very tiring to impossible and very limited. He is still getting used to trilogy and uses it maybe 1-2 hours a day.   At first I thought hospice sooner might be a good idea also as I got a bit scared of all the responsibility. I have no medical training. Very recently we got a lift and a hospital bed from the ALS chapter and I am getting trained but we are not really using it yet.  We interviewed 1 hospice service in town and that was very strange but might mean nothing as it was an ""intake"" nurse and we might never see her again.   pAls definitely qualified but when I asked the question what hospice would do when he is not in pain still breathes OK but cannot swallow (he does not want tube) the conversation when nowhere. This hospice's criteria for administering morphine is pain or breathing difficulties and I wanted find out if not being able to swallow would fit into the pain category. That nurse started to ask me if I would ask hospice to perform physician assisted suicide and if I would like to see the definition. It's illegal in our state. There is at least 1 other hospice service in town but they do not include for trilogy under ""comfort care"". They classify it as life extending measure and would not pay for it.  The third hospice service is for profit and I have not talked to them yet.   We then opted for palliative care at the local clinic and it's what we need at this time. They mentioned hospice too but we can also call that clinic any time day and night with questions.

It was also nice to have access to a nurse 24/7 if I had questions.   It never hurts to talk with several hospices and see what they can offer. I interviewed 3 different agencies.

My pals is very relieved not to go to clinic anymore and it is nice to have them on call like this weekend when he was experiencing pain and they sent a nurse out.  We have an aide for showering and a nurse who comes out and checks on him on a regular basis. He is on trilogy and they are ok with that. They don’t however offer cna help that will stay for any period of time while I run errands that is up to us and not covered by Insurance or Medicare here so I hired a part time cna one day a week for now which we pay for.  However it is a benefit to have all the meds delivered directly to us. He has progressed since starting and it is a relief to have their number here 24/7 and know I won’t get bounced around like we did at the clinic which in our experience was more interested in research than the patient. I can’t tell you how long we would sit in the exam room waiting to be seen hours is not an exaggeration. And after going to clinic for 4 years and participatibg in two clinical trials no one has even called to see how my pals is doing.

43824,2019-03-04 00:00:00,Choices,One of my close PALS friends I met in 2015 never got a PEG. She was bulbar onset but lasted until 2018 without the tube. In the end she continued to try to drink thick shakes. He died with family and hospice in her own home. She said she was ready in an e-mail a couple weeks before. She had one working finger in the end and could use a walker to get to the bathroom until about four months before she died. Her family said she did not suffer. She slipped away one day and was in that state for a couple more days then she passed.  She did have her Trilogy on right up until she passed and her nurse did suctioning.  I have heard of other PALS who stopped eating and drinking. It's a personal choice and I think it's better done with Hospice on board or with sufficient meds that will significantly decrease air hunger and discomfort.

Those are the times it simple is and we simply cope.   Then we have times of anger of mourning. This week has been one of those times. Today my husband was talking about the Namicagin river area with longing. Not a longing to “see it” again. A longing to kayak to camp to hike... Today he said “I hate this existence”. We talked a little. I told him I love him and I hope that helps. I said I hope it helps that I support him no matter what.   Today I hate this existence too but I never say that. Tonight I’ll pull out the grill do what he use to do enjoy the weather and feed him a little steak. Maybe by then I’ll feel better or however I feel in a day an hour a moment we will keep on until the end of this tale.

48517,2021-06-17 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,As Laurie said your dad is safest on a Bipap as that can help your dad expel excess CO2 build up that happens when someone has weak diaphragm muscles. As for overnight care it's just me with no help. I get up usually every 2 hours and adjust his legs his torso or the covers whatever he needs at the moment. I don't work but I am a full-time masters student so I'm a walking zombie pretty much all the time. The one thing I try to do to save my sanity is in the afternoon when my husband naps I'll nap as well. For some reason in his recliner my husband moves around much less so I can usually get a good 2.5 hours of rest.   We also have help in the mornings so I can zone out to do school work. I find that even though there is a demand on my mind having help in the morning revives me to do schoolwork and household chores as I get a much needed ALS break.  I'm glad you were able to get all the equipment your dad needs. For help have you tried your local colleges or universities for LPN students? Here anyway you can act as their practicum supervisor and get free help.

Thank you all for the advice and sharing your personal experiences so far. The bipap is working more for him now that he is used to it. And I agree that he is more rested with the bipap rather than just the oxygen. Although we do give him oxygen sometimes when he asks for it because it seems to help a little bit at least.  We probably won't look into a caregiver yet but I plan to research on it. I agree that a nursing level caregiver isn't needed yet just a regular caregiver would be better. Right now we are still rotating between my mom my sister and I to help him and sleep with him in the living room where all the equipment is. To be honest it's definitely a full day of work and I would argue that helping my dad at home is more work than going to work itself but my family and I are trying to manage it and not stress out but it's definitely hard.

48517,2021-06-28 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Please just be aware that oxygen on its own is dangerous for him. Remember PALS die from a build up of CO2 not a lack of O2 and so giving O2 can cause even more CO2 to build up. I'm so glad the bipap is helping and he is adjusting. If he truly needs extra O2 (and his pulmonologist is the one to determine that) a small amount can be given THROUGH the bipap. It is really uncommon for this to happen until the end stages.  I would suggest that finding a caregiver before you really 'need' one can help get them trained before you are all really worn out. I'm not saying you must do it now just suggesting that you don't leave it til you all say oh we 'need' someone. It is easier to find a good person and train them if you are not desperate for help right now.  We all learn together and I could never have figured things out without the help of wonderful people who were here with me when I was caring for my Chris.

I have been going through many of the same issues. We were fortunate to be able to add onto our ground floor so we have plenty of space and a roll in shower. We have not purchased a van. My husband gets around the neighborhood as much as he wants to with someone accompanying him to watch the traffic. He likes being home and never wanted vacations even when he was well. For doctor's appointments we hire an accessible van service and it's great. The driver straps the chair in drops us off picks us up and I can take it a bit easy on those occasions. I would suggest going on YouTube and looking at videos of the different types of lifts just to get the idea even if they are not ready for it yet. Don't wait till you really need it because you will be stuck. I was so overwhelmed with the choices with everyone telling me something else. One day I woke up and said I just have to take the plunge. I got the Hoyer Advance 340. It does the job I am told it's more compact than others. Then you have to figure out slings.

48517,2021-07-29 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,Hi everyone thanks for all your input. As for roll in showers do you need a special type of shower chair?  My dad doesn't have interest in going around the neighborhood unfortunately. I've offered for him to come outside and I can roll him around with the regular wheelchair but he isn't interested. That's why I was interested to learn about accessible vans because I know he would be more interested in traveling to family member's houses. Thank you for the information. I will keep looking.  I agree bipap masks are hard to get the right fit. I think it takes some time to get used to and you have to trust it.

48517,2021-07-29 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,There are two types of shower buddies one for tubs and one for showers. We chose the one for showers and we had a 2+ inch lip on our shower It went over it fine there is a track that fits over it and the shower seat releases to go over the lip on the track. It isnt inexpensive but we felt it was less expensive than renovating the bathroom. We also used it for toileting as it fit over the toilet. Not to get too graphic but I bought a plastic cup online that was designed for children I think that I clipped to the front when he was on the toilet that enabled him to urinate back into the toilet. I also installed a bidet. He was using all of this until a few days before he passed. It really helped him keep his dignity and he enjoyed his showers immensely. We donated the shower buddy to our local loaner closet after he passed. Hopefully it will help someone else.,True,ARCG,2016-10-12 00:00:00,204,Lost a loved one,2015-01-01 00:00:00,US,TX,Houston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/caregiving-tips-and-mobility-questions.48517/page-2

As the CALS if your PALS isn't in that category yet I would hold it out as a distinctly superior alternative.

And having done them can save a lot of physical and mental pain.  Note --I'm not talking about ""what music do you want at a service?""

It takes experimentation to see what works for him. Start with low settings.  Phlegm can be reduced for some with soda papaya juice or tablets keeping furnace and machine filters clean adjusting room humidity and temperature treating allergies/GERD a nasal steroid warm liquids and such.

45418,2019-12-16 00:00:00,Losses,My losses are a bit different. M was diagnosed with PLS 16 years ago. The good news is we have had time to adjust to the losses. I call it grieving in little pieces....the bad I have been “grieving” for such a long time. I am a retired pediatrician and have always known what was ahead. I am a problem solver so I try to keep ahead of the changes but that carries it’s own pain as M lives his life day by day.  He is permobil bound. His spasticity is such that that he needs help with transfers turning over etc. the good news he has upper body strength so can help. We have adjusted to sharing our lives with two wonderful aides one of whom has just moved in. We got a van that has us able to go on outings. His speech is becoming unintelligible. His swallowing is pretty compromised but he clears his airway. We did renovations early on so now he can navigate his living space. We overlook a beautiful tidal river....We got to travel We have two wonderful dogs. I could go on with the good.....  Then there is the bad. A number of episodes with the baclofen pump that nearly killed him a heart attack a broken hip a broken clavicle. A stubbornness that resists the changes and ways to improve them. His anger at the disease that manifests itself as anger at me. The loss of intimacy and long conversations. The atrophy and changes in his body.....all of these we equilibrate to a new normal.  The last year M’s memory has been failing. Trips we have taken movies we have seen people we have been with....and now the slow decline of thought process. This has been the biggest loss and I am struggling mightily. It brings new meaning to living in the moment. I am trying not to catastrophize as that paralyzes me.

It took a lot of morphine to get her pain level down now she is unconscious and resting. Some family and friends got to see her conscious but in pain now she may not regain consciousness.

Fast forward to now and he is bed bound on a vent at home and total care.....Thats two short sentences but in between those years of 2016 until now we’ve had to deal with the emotions the tears the lack of help learning how to deal with someone who said they never wanted to be trached or have a peg tube end up with a trach and a peg tube because at the time they were frightened couldn't breathe and was fully cognizant of their decision but in the heat of the moment wanted to breathe properly....He was on bipap but started retaining CO2 was intubated got extubated and back to a vent then he said he wanted to breathe..... I'm very fortunate that I have three daughters who moved back in to help. I also pay someone to come in five days a week for him so teresa and my youngest daughter look after him during the day and I do it on weekends with all the girls.... Occasionally I have to admit I break down now and then because of the sheer responsibility... there was a time that my husband wanted hospice but they don’t take vented patients and the thought of him going on a trach collar which will not help him gives me chills and I will not allow it because he would be awake and alert,False,Sasha58,2018-06-17 00:00:00,43,Lost a loved one,2016-06-01 00:00:00,US,Florida,Broward,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/sashas-thread.41944/

42534,2018-08-29 00:00:00,New member--brother on vent,Hello everyone  My name is Joann &amp; my younger brother was diagnosed with ALS in June 2016. (They actually decided that he was already afflicted in January 2016) He was not able to breathe &amp; was rushed to the ER in June &amp; at that time had a trach put in. He cannot talk eat or drink &amp; has been bedridden for over 2 years. He was in a nursing home in the beginning but in Dec. 2016 my parents brought him to their home.   Because Dave had been a penny pincher since he was very small he accumulated a decent amount of money. He (my Dad is the Power of Attorney for him) has been paying for round the clock care for close to 2 years spending about $30000-$35000 per month. He had to be taken to the hospital a few times which was a major undertaking as an ambulance needs to get him there &amp; the fire department also needs to be called in order for the road to be blocked for the ambulance.   My parents have been right in the thick of things even though there are nurses there. They are in their 80's this is really a burden on them but they said they wouldn't want it any other way. My sister &amp; I try to help them with as much as we can but we both work full time jobs &amp; the weekends are about the only days we can relieve them so they can go out to dinner or attend church. Recently they picked out Dave's tombstone which broke all of our hearts. And yesterday they signed a DNR for him. People keep telling me how strong I am for what our family is going through but the real heroes are my parents. I don't know how long it will be until my brother passes but it seems to be getting harder for me to deal with this horrible disease. I'm sure that it is getting harder on all of us but I can't speak for anyone other than myself.  I joined this forum &amp; have been reading a lot of posts and you all seem to be so helpful &amp; SO NICE. I'm sorry if I have rambled on but I was trying to give you the situation in a nutshell.

We were also away on a family vacation and my hubby spent a few nights with my oldest son looking at colleges. So it was back to reality last Wed.  We are using the Pride Go Chair for him to get around and a walkers the rest of the time. He hates the walkers! We are putting in a stair lift and ramps/lift in the house and looking into getting a van or converting my minivan to one that he can use.   We bought new socks and he is going to go through his clothes this weekend to get rid of stuff that no longer fits or works.   Some of the best advice that I got from y'all is to help him make his own decisions. I am struggling with how long it's taking him to make them but I know he is struggling emotionally. I made him agree to speak with a therapist who works with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for grief and loss. I hope it helps him process all of this. He is having a lot of emotional trouble (obviously).   I will be back soon I just wanted to check back in. It's been a tough few weeks for us.

The heaviest piece is 37 lbs. and it takes about 3 min. to disassemble and assemble.   2) Speech path suggested a voice amplifier for work and conserving his tongue muscle by thinking about how to use them -- for eating or talking. For. ex. she suggested that if he is going out for a social time when he will be talking that he conserves mouth energy for talking and eat a high calorie shake or smoothie before we go talk and socialize and then have cheesecake (soft yummy calories) for dessert.   3) We moved our bed closer to our bath so that it's a short walk...  4) I am constantly blown away by how much energy conservation is needed and I am learning so much.

I was using a morphine and clonazepam drops. Don't hesitate to just give her small doses frequently - it's all about comfort.   I also would take a cool (or you might use warm) soft washer and sit with him and just talk on about all kinds of things quietly and gently wash his hands and his face. Even though he wasn't strictly lucid in that last 24 hours he did know I was there and just that bit of skin contact and quiet touching was very soothing for him too.  I'm so glad the kids are there and on the way xxxxx,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/started-the-morphine.43257/page-2

40910,2018-03-07 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"You've brought me as a newbie into the forum today Becky. I believe venting is a very important relief mechanism. Good for you physically. I am grateful that you shared this. I'm sure it wasn't easy to write it all down but I'm thankful you did. No you're not going nuts. You're a queen.      Nuts said:    I think I'm officially graduating from ""we're making the most of it while we can"" to ""Yep this really really sucks"".   It's been a tough few months with five ER visits and two hospital stays three cases of pneumonia and one of the flue. No Matt when you stop choking on every bite or sip it does not mean things got better. It means your body is so used to aspirating that it no longer reacts.  This afternoon we checked into the Durham VA MICU where Matt will be trached and vented tomorrow morning. I'm actually ready for it since that's what he wants to do. I certainly didn't want to do it as an emergency measure. Hopefully we will be home in a couple of days where we should have nursing help from the VA.  I must confess that I finally understand how it can take an hour or more to get a PALS tucked in for the night....and this is someone who spent the entire day in bed. Matt no longer has any functional use of his hands--they move a bit but they won't do anything for him. Scratch rub change the channel blow pick wipe.... If you've been there you know what I mean and if you're not there yet it's too soon to worry about it.  I'm no longer friendly at 3am. In fact it seems I'm downright ugly at 3am. I will schedule at least one overnight shift a week. Other shifts I think may start at 7am...so they can handle the morning routine and I can go back to bed in another room. In this we are extremely fortunate. I DO NOT function well without sleep. I mean 7 good hours of sleep. If I had to do this all by myself well I don't know how long either of us would survive. I think perhaps as my darling was burning up his muscles and strength and hastening his progression with all of our adventures and travels I was also burning up my reserves.   So a new phase of this adventure starts tomorrow. No more slipping out for pizza and leaving him alone for 20 minutes. Oh...never mind....he was told to stop eating by mouth two weeks ago so it's time for me to start that diet I've been putting off until he stopped eating. I do believe I will research diet services that send prepared food. Who wants to cook? I'd better do it soon--I've had nachos for dinner three times in the past week. That's not going to help anything!  I've been in a pretty deep funk for the past six months or so. This decline has been hard to take. I just haven't been able to find anything positive to share and I hate being a downer all the time. Now that the terrible event is upon us well I almost feel a sense of relief. How stupid does that sound? I can just see myself re-reading this a year from now and shaking my head at my foolishness. Or maybe it's just more self-preservation.   The RT here in the hospital just turned the alarms on the vent on. Crap. Why do I want to hear an apnea alarm when the vent self adjusts to handle the problem? Yeah--that might not stick once I""m home. I do need to learn about the other alarms however.  ok...off to get something for his headache. Every pain in his body need. s a different medication.

40910,2018-03-07 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Hello Family and thank you for all of the support!  OK I was a bit optimistic about going home so soon. I spoke to the pulmo during rounds this morning and asked about staying through Monday to avoid the grueling return trip for the first trach change (after that they happen at home). He is in agreement. I've been practicing on Dan the Dummy since yesterday and the RT who supplies the Trilogy who has been with us from the beginning comes at noon to give me her training and get Matt off the hospital vent and onto the Trilogy. Next shift I change the inner cannula. It seems fairly straight forward once I get it all straight in my mind.  In addition to he getting used to the invasive ventilation we are working on nutrition (he was always hungry on the 2 cal so we switched tog glucerna with twice as many feeds. I finally found a nutritionist who didn't cringe when I mentioned blending so I'll be honest about supplementing with real food done in the Vitamix). This morning she brought up a Diabetic formula. They can't get it in the hospital but she's ordering it for home. Now that that's settled endocrine is going to give me the new plan for managing his blood sugars. I don't have the strength right now to fight over the healthier real food formulas and I don't know how much energy I'll really have for blending for him.   Speech is coming in to evaluate him for a Passey Muir valve. If he can come off the vent and still breath on his own (they will try that later) we may be able to ease into the eye gaze a little more slowly.  We are in the Medical ICU at the Durham VA Hospital and I'm very impressed. He is so well monitored and alarmed that when something changes overnight they are generally in the room before either of us is fully awake and reacting to it. The staff is warm caring attentive and very professional. Our favorite equipment fairy from Prostetics (I'm sure any PALS or CALS who gets care here knows Deanna) as already made some more changes/fixes/improvements to his chair and has reordered the trilogy/o2 mount that somehow went astray. She is AWESOME.   We were not prepared for the difficulty of this MAJOR change. I am convinced that it is manageable with help and will enable us to make more great memories (closer to home   but it's physically mentally and emotionally exhausting. The shear volume of supplies is shocking. Boy am I glad I started clearing more things out of our bedroom to make room for this stuff.   I'd already decided to move my cloths into a spare bedroom and send my dresser to the garage to make more room. It was a good decision!! My twin bed stays there but it's on wheels and can be moved out of the way during the day or when I'm sleeping down the hall.  Me....I lost my cookies last night and had a serious meltdown. I imagine the staff somewhere listening over a speaker and being on standby to rush in if I escalated any further! After being fire hosed all day I just couldn't cope with having to crawl out of my comfy chair every 4 minutes to do or undo something that we'd already done or decided not to do just moments before. Yep I'm a full-fledged Queen of Ugly and it doesn't even have to be 3am!! Fortunately once I calmed down we were fine and he actually had a better night. As I raise my head and look out the window I'm staring straight at the Cambria. It's calling to go over for at least one night and given the quality of care here I'm going to try to convince Matt that it'll be ok if I go. This is also a test. I learned from the social worker that in the event that I have an emergency and he has to be put into care without advance planning he would stay right here on the ward where we are now. See how easy it's getting for me to rationalize a night away  . I'm getting there folks!!!  OK this book is long enough. Thanks to everyone who's gone this way before and shared their stories so that I've been as prepared as I have been and to everyone for the good wishes and support.   And no we will not be going back to Colorado. Not gonna happen...

40910,2018-03-07 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Becky you will do awesome with the vent. I’m always here for you. In time you’ll be able to change that inner cannula and suction in the dark. It doesn’t seem like it at the moment but it will happen. Then you will wonder what you were so afraid of.   If Matt can still talk ask about his cuff being let down. He can talk around it in the Trilogy. Not on the hospital vents. No need for a passer Muir valve. The trilogy is meant to work with the extra leak of air and automatically adjusts. Brian spoke that way for years on the vent.   His first trach wasn’t changed for 2 years and we were home in 4 days. Every place does it different though.

41954,2018-07-02 00:00:00,Progressive use of the Trilogy bi-pap,Charlotte  There are no good aggregate data for days of survival after starting BiPAP. As you have seen some here are several years in.  Think about how heterogeneous a population that is depending on how on-the-ball a clinic is or how willing a PALS is to start it when visits are typically once a quarter. And then there is bulbar onset vs. limb onset and varying degrees of competence/willingness to titrate settings as things progress how much support in finding the right mask (what kinds is your dad using? You should not need to rotate 3) so many possible unseen confounds.  So take that 300 days and throw it far far out of your mind. Anyway we've all learned here that it's as much about quality of life as quantity. As a CALS at some point you will find one is subordinate to the other and you/your PALS will choose. Preferably also in advance...and documented as such.

42778,2018-10-04 00:00:00,Mood changes,Hi all This is sort of an update post (last post was in the Newly Diagnosed) but I wanted to move my thread to a maybe more appropriate category.  My husband has gotten a second opinion from the chief neurologist at the University of Münster in Germany where he is from. He was also able to visit with his family in Germany and I think that helped him. The second opinion confirmed the slow-progressing MND and we have had a few more tests which ruled out many mimic diseases so far. Right now his progression remains left hand weakness and fasiculations (sp?) in the left arm.   Update on me: I lost the pregnancy I had at the time of diagnosis which was still very early along. It's terrible to say that it was something of a relief because I don't know how I could have handled having a newborn and caring for my 5 year old daughter and my husband all at once. I don't have much support from family.   Now that we are a month past diagnosis my husband's mood has changed a lot. He's been distant from us and hasn't seemed to want to take care of day to day life stuff that he always has done. I don't mind and can take care of stuff around the house but I'm worried because he had really high hopes for the NurOwn trial but was told they aren't taking new patients right now. I guess this is due to manufacturer delays they said. Without that hope he's been very depressed. I suggested he get counseling but he says they can't help him and would only tell him to accept his death which he doesn't want to do at this point. He has a point on that because it's so early on and who knows what progression will be like in the future.   Have any CALs had experience with their PALs getting counseling and has that helped them with mood? I should also mention my husband has already been taking THC:CBD oil and THC via a vape pen as well as curcumin based upon suggestions I read on this site. He started rilutek a week ago or so. He will have physical therapy in learning to cope with the loss of the hand  Any suggestions would be great!,False,Cristin P,2018-08-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2018-08-01 00:00:00,US,CA,San Diego,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/mood-changes.42778/

41944,2018-06-23 00:00:00,Sasha’s thread,Hi Sasha  Sorry I am late to the party. Welcome. My husband is also trached and vented. He will reach 8 years vented here in Aug. I found this place about 2.5 years ago I think. I take care of my husband pretty much alone.   I used to have nurses but insurance has taken away private duty so I had to stay home and try to work from here while caring for him. I cannot afford a nurse. My DS 31 is here on Friday’s since it is his off day. That’s my day for errands and also taking care of my folks. My DD 23 is in PT school away from home. She helps when she is here.   I will tell you that I have learned from here if your husband would chose to go off of the vent he would be well sedated before they removed it. Mine has not chosen that yet. And here too I cannot get hospice due to the vent but now I also cannot even get Home Health to visit.  As to his trach pressing on his neck. We were instructed and have always used a split 4x4 around the trach. I use two or 3 together. Not a dressing but it keeps the trach off of the skin. You can get them from your DME. Mine are a regular part of the order. I also have one around his G-tube as well.

41944,2018-06-23 00:00:00,Sasha’s thread,Hello Sasha and welcome.  What a roller coaster you've been on. My husband initially said no vent but it only took one episode of air hunger to change that. He was trached in March and we've been in and out of the hospital ever since. We may be looking at regular monthly 10 day antibiotic courses to keep the infections at bay. It's ironic--his skin is in remarkable shape but we just can't stop the pneumonia.  I can appreciate hour terribly tired you are. What you've been through is not only physically but mentally and emotionally exhausting. Thank heavens for your children!   I have some very small roll pillow forms that I made small pillow cases for. We put them behind my husband's neck which tilts his head back and takes some pressure off the trach. We counter the angle and help him see the TV by tilting the bed forward (Trendelenburg is a huge help).

41954,2018-07-03 00:00:00,Progressive use of the Trilogy bi-pap,Karen;  Restless sleep is the biggest hindrance to my wife's quality of life at this time. This morning she settled down @ 1:30 am but yesterday it was 3:30 am. Of course I also lose sleep because of this but can catch a nap during the day while our caregiver is here.  We were using Clonazepam for sleep but she became increasingly more irritable (as  I have been told a know side affect) so we stopped the doses.  We are using CBD oil and that helps but we are still working on the right doses. We are also investigating THC.  I hope to reduce her use of Tylenol by using the M derivatives.  We also have decided not to vent. We are told the Trilogy will do the job until time catches us.

Has he explored  other trials ? I would also remind him that many here feel that they have extended the quality/quantity of life through ""non-investigational"" approaches as simple as prompt use of mobility devices/BiPAP; ROM/stretching/massage and much more. No one has to sit around and wait for death.  As with anyone the success of counseling is likely to hinge on who he is and what he needs at this time but if he wants to try why not?   A month out I would guess he is still in some stage of depression/anger/grief and most people are helped by explicitly acknowledging those feelings whether through a third party or with each other. Apart from counseling if he goes that route I would encourage most of all keeping the lines of communication open so you both know you can keep telling each other anything any time. You don't have to exercise that right for it to be important.

To him it may have hit harder as he may feel it was his last chance to have another child. Add in that maybe you are not showing the sorrow he would expect and is recent Dx. He is bearing a lot right now.  I suggest continually talking as Laurie has mentioned and allow him to express grief he may be having over the loss of the child and knowing the battle he is about to face.  And give it some time.

42713,2018-09-24 00:00:00,Restless at Night,My PALS was diagnosed in May 2017. He has ALS/FTD feeding tube placed in May with continuous feed Bipap starting in May at night is all upper body and can still walk but will assistance. When he received the bipap he immediately adapted to it and slept twelve hours the first night. In fact he fell asleep ten minutes after it was put on. He now asks for it during the day usually the late afternoon. During the last month he has gotten VERY restless when he goes to bed at 10pm. He says he is tired but he moves his legs around a lot asks to get up to go to the bathroom at least once an hour and doesn't settle down into a real sleep until between 1 and 2 am. I take him to the bathroom at 7am adjust his bed to an angle and hook him up to the feeding pump. He immediately falls into a deep sleep and sleeps until about 11:30-noon.. He may ask to go to the bathroom about 10am. It doesn't matter if I get him up earlier in the day. Saturday I got him up at 9am because our house was being re-roofed noisy! He was still very restless that night.  I am wondering if the bipap settings need to be adjusted. He can't tell me how it feels to him because of the FTD. I have noticed that after a trip to the bathroom his breathing is very rapid when he is back on the bipap. We have a clinic visit in two weeks and they will test his breathing but I was wondering if there is anything I should ask. We take the bipap to every appointment and they download the data and adjust the machine. So far his breathing was been the same since May and there have been no adjustments. They have been very happy with the data so far.   Or could there be something else causing the restlessness? Any advice would be appreciated.

He got elbow blocks and arm supports lateral supports and a new headrest. He is not happy with most of them. Says they restrict his movement too much. He says he wants me to take them all off and go back to what he had but I am trying to get him to live and work with them for a few days before giving up. He tends to have an all-or-nothing approach. It doesn't work just get rid of it rather than try to figure things out. ARHG!!!!!  Just shot off an email to the PT and wheelchair tech from clinic asking to meet with them to try to work things out. We had been scheduled for clinic this coming Tuesday but due to the Dr being out of town had to be moved back to November. The PT is usually very responsive so I'm hoping to hear back from her soon.  Me on the other hand - well my varicose veins have decided to act up. I've had problems with them forever a combination of unlucky genetics and being overweight. Tuesday when the aide was here I was putting on my shoes when out of the blue blood started spurting out of my leg. Picture if you stuck a pin in a water balloon. Yikes! I got it to stop and went to the Dr. Apparently this happens sometimes with varicose veins and they recommended I see a vascular surgeon to see what can be done. So this coming Tuesday I have an appointment to be seen. And people wonder what I do on my ""day off"" when the aide comes. Of course this is also all happening 2 weeks before my weekend away that I finally got covered and am really looking forward to. Fingers crossed they can get this figured out!

42778,2018-10-04 00:00:00,Mood changes,I've definitely been grieving a lot these last some weeks. My husband has always been the strong one the one that takes care of everything. He is very active and has trouble sitting still. When he had his MRI before diagnosis he even had a hard time just laying still for 20 minutes in the machine. So I know this is going to be a huge adjustment for him not just physically. I suggested counseling to him to help him adjust emotionally as well but he wasn't interested saying that it wouldn't help him. I guess my question is for others experience to see if I should even try to convince him to get counseling? Or do you think he'll start feeling better at some point without it? He's never been a depressed guy and it's really hard for me to see him like this and not be able to help him feel better. *Edit: Actually as I'm writing this out I think maybe *I'm* the one who needs counseling to accept that he's gonna change. :/,True,Cristin P,2018-08-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2018-08-01 00:00:00,US,CA,San Diego,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/mood-changes.42778/
42778,2018-10-04 00:00:00,Mood changes,Thanks for clarifying -- if he is not on board with counseling I wouldn't try. You're still his best counselor. That doesn't change. If/when he needs more/different he can make that choice.  Again we can't over-emphasize that PALS need more than a month to -- I'm not going to say adjust or adapt -- recalibrate their expectations of the future.   So if you think you might need counseling to be a good counselor yourself try a first visit and see if you and the counselor are a match.

42778,2018-10-04 00:00:00,Mood changes,It sounds like your husband has very slowly progressive disease so far. He is also young. So most likely his course will continue to be slow. He’s going to be at this a while.   This disease also threatens his ability to provide financially for your family. Young guys especially may have a hard time with that as it really hits their self-esteem.  It’s going to take him a while to come to grips with all this. But he has time. One advantage about slow progression is that there is more time to adapt to all the changes.  Counseling might definitely help but it sounds like he’s declining this. Going on a low dose antidepressant is another option. You could tell him that it doesn’t have to be a long term medication but that it sometimes helps give a person a boost in energy. Don’t know if he’ll go for it or not but it might be worth a shot.  Would he be interested in checking out this forum?,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/mood-changes.42778/

I've also sent him links to lots of posts here to give him ideas and info on stuff. Not sure he wants to post here himself. He's kind of a stoic guy that doesn't like to show lots of emotions or talk about how he's feeling which makes this a bit difficult.   He did seem better after work today and even cooked dinner (something he enjoys doing) so maybe things are looking up. He mentioned that the Rilutek makes him feel ""hazy"" is how he described it and I know he hasn't been sleeping well due to the fasiculations waking him up.   Any tips on side effects of the Rilutek? Is ""brain fog"" common?

42778,2018-10-05 00:00:00,Mood changes,Cristin - I can’t speak to the Rilutek as DH declined it. It can affect he liver and DH’s goal was to beat this thing so he did want those complications.  As to an antidepressant. DH is on one. At first I had to sneak it into him. I know that wasn’t right but it made a big difference. However if your husband is seeming to be doing a bit better I’d still give it a bit of time first.  My husband was DX in 07 after 2.5 years of trying to figure out what was going on. He’s been on a vent 8 years now. This all started at 42 I think? Your husband may have more time than he thinks. Mine continued to work and run our business until he was vented. He chose to quit then but could have continued for a few more years.

42778,2018-10-05 00:00:00,Mood changes,I found the initial side effects of riluzole subsided n a month or less. Adjusting the timing might help. I was told although a 12 hour interval was ideal 8 was ok and I take it about 30 an hour before bed and first thing in am If he has to be out early that might not work of course. Also the no food thing is actually no fat. I was told it was ok to have something fat free with it like fruit  I take magnesium for cramps but it also relaxes me and helps me sleep. Don’t know if this is worth a try?  If your husband wants to he could become a lurker- he doesn’t have to talk unless he wants to.

42461,2018-08-20 00:00:00,MND - in india and some questions,I'm very sorry about your wife and sadly welcome you.  The NGO in India is Asha Ek Hope -- they are on line.   For now you can avoid giving her water and instead use liquids that are thicker e.g. with egg cornstarch ice cream bananas ice etc. always blended. Some thicker juices coffee tea may work as well. Depending on the tablets many can be crushed and taken in a spoon with pudding applesauce or ice cream. Check to make sure the tablet can be crushed first. If not many medicines are available in liquid form or there are often similar medications that are crushable. Let us know if you need more information on a particular drug.  Ultimately your wife may need a feeding tube in order to continue nutrition.  Her lung function should be evaluated to see if she may need a BiPAP machine to help her breathing. But for now using a humidifier warm liquids/papaya or pineapple juice before bed a taller pillow or bed wedge etc. may help. It is also good to make sure furnace or A/C filters are clean.

For what you ask - there's NONE. Asha Ek Hope may have affiliations with good foreign Care giving societies and certainly do seem to have some useful data but for what I see its a simple front to promote Stem Cell procedures. They might actually work but for all I have read or even the learned opinion in the forum is they don't.   Proper diagnosis related counselling and self will is perhaps your major support in India. As for the first two my experience with NIMHANS Bangalore was indeed good. For second opinion have been to CMC Vellore and nothing to fault their either. Rest of the support I would say is mostly self derived and should not be difficult to find a local medical practitioner referred by the doctors in either of the hospitals i spoke of.

42697,2018-09-21 00:00:00,Need help with Avap setting,Hopefully he will tolerate IPAP of 12. If he doesn’t the other thing to look at is the backup rate or breaths per minute (BPM).   I see this is set to 15. 15 is a fairly fast rate. That would be appropriate for someone who can not initiate breaths on their own at all. If he still can initiate breaths and doesn’t tolerate the IPAP of 12 then consider lowering the backup rate to somewhere between 12-14.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/need-help-with-avap-setting.42697/
42697,2018-09-21 00:00:00,Need help with Avap setting,The ideal is not to trigger the backup rate though so you want to set it low -- 8 is fine as a starting point.

42713,2018-09-24 00:00:00,Restless at Night,If his breathing is more rapid when he is taken off the BiPAP I would start leaving it on (is it more rapid or different at the point you take it off or only when you turn it back on?). Assuming he really needs it during sleep it gets to be a bigger and bigger adjustment to come out of sleep and switch to a waking pattern if that made sense. Does the same thing happen if he wakes up in the morning -- can you try the same thing without the trip to the bathroom? And that would make sense to try in clinic as well.  Also the next time it happens note the time and ask the clinic to look at that data in that light. What machine does he have? There is a free app that can help you decipher things. Is the machine set to show you data while the machine is going? If not I can help you set that up.   The restlessness could be if the settings are not helping him ease into deep sleep quickly enough yes -- which could require adjustment in either direction. Again watching the screen can help you see which way to adjust.

42713,2018-09-25 00:00:00,Restless at Night,When he gets back from the trip to the bathroom his breathing is more rapid before I hook him up to the bipap. After the bipap is on it takes a minute or so for his breathing to adjust to a slower pace.   His breathing is more rapid when he is off the bipap at rest too. He asks for it now during the day and is on it from early/mid afternoon through the night. He sits up in an adjustable bed during the day or a recliner. We have noticed he slides down in the recliner intentionally and not and that makes it harder for him to breath. He also prefers the bed so we are generally defaulting to the bed unless he asks for the recliner.   He wants the bed flat to sleep. He likes to sleep on his side. Could the lowering of the bed at bedtime also be making his breathing more difficult?  After I take him to the bathroom in the morning adjust the bed up and connecting the pump he goes immediately back to sleep. It is the period from getting in bed (10-11) and 1:30-2 where he is restless. He will usually go to the bathroom between 1 and 2 and then fall into a deep sleep.  It is just such a contrast from when he first got the bipap. Then he would fall asleep 10-15 minutes after putting it on.  His machine is the Philips Respironics Dream Station. I know I can look at data when it is going but the only thing I really check or sort of understand is the leak rate. Since we determined the nasal pillows work for him leaking hasn't been a problem.,True,MVFinVA,2017-09-05 00:00:00,116,Lost a loved one,2017-05-01 00:00:00,US,VA,S,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/restless-at-night.42713/
42713,2018-09-25 00:00:00,Restless at Night,I think there at least two things in play. His breathing gets faster without the BiPAP because he needs to be on it. He's not getting enough air without it.   And his restlessness getting in bed sounds different than his demeanor throughout the day so I think your comment about the flat bed is on point. That makes it harder to breathe even on his side. Have you tried gradually over time making the bed less flat so he can get used to it? Normally at least a 10% head angle works better and the lower part of the bed can be adjusted accordingly to support his side sleeping with foam blocks if needed.  Also try to look at the screen when he is sleeping and take a picture of the settings (1) and data (2) if you can.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/restless-at-night.42713/

I made some changes for him and then Facetimed with the wheelchair rep to make some more. There were some that the rep wanted to look into so he is coming out tomorrow. Hope we get some resolution.  Then there's the issue with my legs. I went to the vascular surgeon last week who wrote a script for an ultrasound. The appointment was at 11 this morning. When the tech was doing the test she discovered a blood clot in the back of my knee. Protocol says - I'm off to the ER. Where I wait. And wait. After 2 hours of waiting I finally went to the back. The nurse checks my vitals and draws some blood. Then she starts setting me up for an IV. Whoa. I asked about what was going to happen. She said I'd probably get an IV drip then be admitted! I flew into a panic. It was after 3 and DH's aide was already staying late. She's a single mom so I KNOW she can't stay overnight. Texted DH and gave him an update but asked him to wait on calling out the troops until I spoke with the doctor. Wait again... Luckily when he came in the doctor said if all my labs came back OK he could write me a script for a blood thinner and I could go home and follow up with my family doc. Wait wait wait. Finally 6 hours after I entered the hospital I left. Half a venous study done script for Xarelto in hand. Ugh.   After I drove home and calmed down a bit DH said his sister had called and asked him to call her. Yes the sister who is coming to stay with him this weekend so I can have my get-away.

41796,2018-05-28 00:00:00,NinaP's Mother,Mum can only move her right hand now and that is very stiff right now she hardly lifts her right leg which used to be so strong. She lost amost everything in 4-5 months. Happened so quickly. We were diagnosed in Larisa in a great University hospital my younger sister lives there. After visiting so many doctors and neurologists. A woman neuro from another city told us that it could be autoimmune and we should go to a good hospital Till then doctors were telling us it could be phsycological or something since all her tests were great  They gave us a diagnosis in 3 days even before the emg from the clinical image. The EMG just confirmed it till then i was hoping it was myasthenia gravis. Her head being high and her back makes her breath better? Nobody told us.  I had a doc visit her on Friday to check her breathing he said it was pretty good. This week i would get a nose mouth doc to check her eating and swalloing she cheked her again about 25 days ago and said it was great and should just eat carefully and slowly. We pay for all that her insurance only pays for the medicine we pay all the rest. The doctors get 30 t0 50 euros per visit. We spend about 2500euros per month and not counting all the tests and doctors before the diagnosis. I also stopped working and that is a leave without pay. Going to check on hospital beds this week and from what i asked its 80euros per month the good ones.  Where i live we have the biggest cancer percentage in Greece heart and strokes. We are Greeces industrial center with 4 power factories and so much pollution you can check on line. So we lose 2-3 people per day from that and rather young ones so people are used to that and dont care to demand better things. Closed ones and close friends were telling me at first that i should be happy mum reached 70 since so many die much earlier here.   Imagine that we had to wait almost over am onth to start therapy waiting for the medicine because its so rare. And now that the first bulk is almost over the second one is not here year and i have to go check tomorrow and mum most likely is going to be without her medicine for a couple of days. Its like telling you leeave her bedridden and hope for a peacefull death. I myself have started begging for a peacefull death and hope she wont live all those terryfing things.  This morning was my first outing in 3 days. Went for a coffee and mum called to ask when i was coming back even though my younger sister was with her.  These past 5 months iam so sick of doctors and hospitals. We lost our dad aafter 6 years of being sick and seeing mum like that. You guys telling me to go check myself but iam so scared you know. Scared. Phew. I dont want to go to another doctor. We just eated our first ice cream for the season and it was great. But mum is so down right now mentally. We carry her from bed to couch with a wheelchair and then back to bed. I dont know what to do to help her more. She wakes up almost every two hours per night.   Thank you all for the messages.

43310,2018-12-23 00:00:00,Worried about the future,Hi yes I was doing better. Now I’m so worried about the financial security of our family. Before this we had a plan for retirement college etc.   My husband earns almost twice what I make. How are we going to survive when he can’t work? And how will we make it once he is gone? He has life insurance but it won’t make up for the 20+ years of no 2nd income. I’ve thought about how we may have to move but the thought of moving my boys seems so cruel - I can’t take them away from their friends.   And my husband already is so devastated by the burden he is putting on us (I don’t see it that way). The thought of talking to him about this seems so cruel.   We are meeting with our lawyer to do legal power of attorney etc on Monday. But the financial piece is so hard to figure out. We will get a financial planner but should we also get a medical/disability attorney.,False,Thomas933,2018-12-04 00:00:00,91,CALS,2018-12-01 00:00:00,Uni,RI,Providence,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/worried-about-the-future.43310/

I did find some lighter weight ones for warmer weather. He was usually cold so shorts went by the wayside.   We used with the ""straps inside the pants"" method. With the loose sweatpants it got to be pretty easy to slide the straps out.   As for positioning on the toilet (we also had a bidet seat) I used to stand to the side and use one hand to gently push back on his knees while lowering (luckily we had a power lift). It helped to get him back a little bit further. Our lift had a pretty high ""lift height"" which also helped.   Patience and practice!

41796,2018-05-28 00:00:00,NinaP's Mother,Re: Question for Cals.   Thank you Nina for giving us more information. Even writing here is an extra task for you and I hope you will find it time well spent.  I'm glad your mother's breathing and swallowing is still good. You can talk to her and that is a very very good thing even when she can be so demanding on your first little getaway. But it shows you how important you are to her. You gave up your income and your freedom for her. Talk to her and maybe tell her that you will take care of her no matter what but that she is your mom and she'll have to take care of you too. She can be your biggest help when she accepts and sometimes endures other caregivers. She can say thank you that way. If she grasps the importance of keeping you sane and sound it will be easier to be without you for a little while. And when you go out and relax a little you hopefully return in a better mood and have new stories to tell her.  The financial strain sounds horrible. You probably have to prioritize. In my opinion quality of life goes before therapy with a somewhat hopeless disease like this. Anything that will make her feel better. Range of motion exercises passively keeping her mobile is important. It helps with pain and digestion. A good physiotherapist is often more use than a good doctor.  What kind of medicine does she get? Riluzol? No drug to this date promises to stop or even reverse ALS. It's just slowing it down. With a slow progression that could mean years with a fast progression it's maybe just weeks of benefit.  The hospital bed is a good investment. It's important to watch your back as a CALS. You said that your mother wakes up every two hours and I assume that you need to turn or move her because she's uncomfortable. We had only two week like that no sleep for more than 1-4 hours at a time. I was overtired and prone to mistakes all day. Luckily we got a soft foam mattress to prevent dekubitus and lots of special pillows together with some basic knowledge in positioning. It made a huge difference. Good sleep is important for everyone involved. Even more so than ice cream. Ice cream is a good second I'd say.    That reminds me that I have to stop here and go to bed myself. 2:30 is not completely out of the ordinary for me. Sleeping is not always easy with all those thoughts. But tomorrow is a new day and we'll just have to see how that goes.,True,wishmobbing,2017-12-05 00:00:00,729,Lost a loved one,2017-07-01 00:00:00,DE,Germany,Stuttgart,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/ninaps-mother.41796/

43310,2018-12-23 00:00:00,Worried about the future,I am sorry. It is hard. If he is not a veteran( and you have not mentioned it) then look at social security. It won’t be miraculous but your kids who are minors can receive benefits when he does and they will continue as long as they are 18 or less ( 19 if still in high school). There is a cap on total family amount and rules about how you use the money but it will help a bit. Find out about job benefits too.   It is good you are doing the paperwork and planning early. Getting that done will help you move forward  Sometimes people have to move for financial reasons or for accessibility. If it needs to happen during the PALS lifetime earlier is better   In my family 3 members stayed in place and the others moved. The people who moved also relocated but more often PALS move locally.    MGH clinic has a social worker. I have never seen her but I can’t imagine she is anything but good at her job. She might be someone to chat to about available resources.   I know someone mentioned CCALS to you.

I worked for nearly a year throughout my diagnosis process and it was too stressful. Getting financial affairs in order is necessary but everything doesn't have to be done at once. Pace yourself.  Your husband is going to need you so you must eat exercise and take care of your health as best you can. The same goes for your husband.

42436,2018-08-17 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,Hi Tammy sorry to welcome you here. And no you can never really be prepared if only mentally for his loss of mobility -- just remember neither is he so be good to each other. Does your husband have or are you in the process of getting a wheelchair? Shower chair?   Often your local ALS Association (ALSA) chapter can provide a loaner lift so you do not have to buy one. Medicare only reimburses for a manual but pretty much of all us need power.   It is also worth checking what other loan items are available that might be helpful though there are also many things you will want to buy that are not Medicare-reimbursable. If you can tell us more about your husband that would help us suggest things to think about.   Most commonly the brand you will be lent is the original -- the Hoyer/Joerns/Sunrise types -- the company has changed hands -- but they are all similar.

42436,2018-08-18 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,Thanks Lauri. We are in the process of ordering a power wheel chair. We bought a van and we are hoping the get a loaner chair soon. We are installing a ramp to get out of the house. He uses a rollator in the house and uses a travel chair when we go out. We've raised the toilet so high that it really looks like a throne   He has a lift chair that we got a while ago. We installed a stair lift so he is still able to be upstairs.  Someone is coming on Tuesday to look at our house and see if there is anything to do that we haven't thought of. I can't see getting my husband into bed without a hoyer for too much longer. He has trouble feeding himself.  I'm worried that one day soon he just won't be able to walk anymore and I won't be ready for it. I have children with special needs of their own and I feel like I don't have enough time in a day to get this together.,True,TammyS,2018-08-15 00:00:00,20,CALS,2017-02-01 00:00:00,US,CT,suburb,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/
42436,2018-08-18 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,Tammy for your long term planning be aware that the stair lift will be unusable when he loses core strength.,True,GregK,2013-01-29 00:00:00,2775,PALS,2012-11-01 00:00:00,US,CO,Colorado Springs,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/
42436,2018-08-18 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,Medicare doesn't pay for a battery operated lifts although private insurance might. If you can't get it covered check Craig's List Facebook Marketplace or similar listings for used Hoyer or similar lifts. Many are quite new and briefly used. Before buying consider how usable even a battery powered one will be for you. If the room(s) you will be using it in are carpeted it may be difficult to move the lift with your husband in it.   A frequent problem is that a Hoyer lift simply won't fit or have enough space to turn and position in the bathroom. You could still use it for transferring him onto a shower chair/commode and moving him into the bathroom and over the toilet on that. Catch 22: Medicare doesn't cover equipment for use in the bathroom or equipment on wheels so it can be pushed into the bathroom. That means using a bedside commode in the bedroom and having someone empty it. This a big emotional stumbling block for most people but the fact is that at some point your caregivers will be wiping your bottom for you -- and more -- anyway.   That leaves you paying for a shower chair or commode on wheels yourself or finding a way to put wheels on a standard bedside commode. Unless his progression is very slow or money isn't an issue don't buy any type of lift that doesn't fully support him -- arms head and trunk -- or require him to grip a hand grip or bar. It will be a temporary solution.   A better solution (but also not covered by Medicare) is an overhead lift in the bathroom. Another Catch 22: A power wheelchair can be as difficult to use in a bathroom as a Hoyer lift.   As Greg said a stair lift is a short-term solution as he gets weaker. Even with a seatbelt on it it becomes difficult to sit upright and to keep your feet on the small footrest. More importantly you will need to be able to transfer him to and from the stair lift to a wheelchair both downstairs and upstairs.   The bottom line is that you need to plan for having a place for both of you to sleep downstairs. If money is an issue spend it on equipment and modifications for that rather than more short-term solutions for upstairs.,True,Diane H,2013-09-28 00:00:00,645,PALS,1985-11-01 00:00:00,US,IN,Fort Wayne,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/
42436,2018-08-18 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,"Thanks Greg and Diane. Six months ago I thought about whether or not a stair lift would be a prudent purchase. It was very expensive and I realized it's temporary but I decided it was worthwhile for us. Because of our family situation we we hadn't been able to go on the expensive vacation we had planned (my husband would have been able to go at the time). So we got the lift instead. My husband has been grateful to be able to continue to go upstairs.  I'm going to see if we can use a ceiling lift in the bathroom to get my husband on the toilet. I know he would be very happy with that. I will see on Tuesday whether or not it's feasible when the man who is going to do the assessment comes to our house.  I figured we would have to move downstairs eventually. The only place would be the living room. We have a large family room so I don't think it would have too big of an impact. We can use sliding wooden doors to close up the openings and the PWC can still fit through. It has a hardwood floor so it shouldn't be too difficult to move a hoyer around (hopefully) but I will see about a ceiling lift for there. I've ordered room darkening curtains and I will need to put the furniture someplace. The problem is the downstairs bathroom. It's very small. We might be able to take away the laundry area next to it and maybe it will be workable. I doubt it. He will probably have to use a commode which I know he won't be happy with.  I guess things aren't as bad as they seemed in my head now that I've written this all out. I just have to do a number of things. Hopefully my husband will continue to be able to walk as I get this ready. He has been using a brace for one foot for a while so we got one for his other leg. That has helped a little. I'm a little nervous that they are still looking for a loaner PWC for him. I hope we'll get it soon.  I feel like there was this ""honeymoon"" period where he didn't need much help and now that's over.",True,TammyS,2018-08-15 00:00:00,20,CALS,2017-02-01 00:00:00,US,CT,suburb,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/
42436,2018-08-18 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,We only have a half bath downstairs so when I could no longer use the stair lift we had to get creative to allow me to even get into it. There was no room for a shower and I really don't miss the effort of using the one upstairs. I had already limited showering to very infrequent. We found that I could have a comfortable and thorough bath while sitting on the toilet and getting a good soaping and wash down. Dripping water on the floor there isn't a problem! We expanded the floor space by using double doors from the hallway. See  ALS Patient Care From Both Sides: An Accessible Half Bath   Taking down the wall between the bathroom and laundry room should give plenty of space. It may require some other rearranging and door widening. A stackable washer would free up floor space if you can find one with big enough capacity for your family's amount of laundry. The person assessing your space should be able to say if the space is workable. For your current upstairs bathroom look into a wall mount overhead lift. They don't require the added expense of installing using the ceiling joists. And when he does move downstairs the actual hoist the expensive part of a lift can be re-used downstairs.,True,Diane H,2013-09-28 00:00:00,645,PALS,1985-11-01 00:00:00,US,IN,Fort Wayne,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/
41221,2018-05-07 00:00:00,Drained,Many of us stopped going to clinic at some point. If you are wondering about hospice morphine and the like a primary care doc or other community doc can write those things.   If the process exhausts your husband and does not add value why do it?  I hope you get whatever you are aiming for with the faxing. Many institutions can't or don't want to deal with HIPAA-compliant email (essentially either using secure credentialed portals or coloring outside the lines) so they cling to faxes. You will find smaller practices often more willing to do email.

42819,2018-10-10 00:00:00,My dad has trouble accepting ALS,Hello! New to the forum.   My dad has ALS. Aged 64. Diagnosed in November 2016. He's lost all ability to swallow and speak although he continues to try. Can still walk with a mild left foot drop.   We moved to in September after sustaining two devastating hurricanes last fall. He was in fine when we moved. He dropped from 220lbs to under 100lbs and his doctor said he was going to die from being stubborn for resisting the feeding tube. He freaked at imminent death and got the feeding tube in May. He’s back up over 110lbs.  The problem in my state is that assisted living centers cannot do feeding tubes (unless they have the highest level of certification) so we put him in independent living. However home care aides can not assist with feeding tubes only RNs. Which are pricey. He gets 3 feeds a day and Rizoule 2 times a day on an empty stomach. So that’s 5 trips to feed and medicate him. I found an assistive living person licensed to do tube feedings 25 minutes away and he refuses.   I have a busy home life of my own with a family to raise. Plus I need to go back to work. I am so angry with him. He squandered so much money running a business that he doesn’t have the means to live the way he wants——independent with people to do the feedings so it’s all on me for now. Which is not sustainable.   And he’s so unreasonable and selfish with his requests and demands. He sends away the home health aides in the morning if they are new because he doesn’t want to deal with the change. He is texting me constantly and questioning my whereabouts.   I have no friends here and no work and no life. And tons of guilt. He needs to go to the assisted living center as he fell last week and had texted me in the middle of the night to come help with the trilogy. He has stated he doesn’t want trach but I am afraid he will freak out again and get it when he can no longer comfortably breathe.   I am trying to get MDs to discuss the process with him but they pawn it off on the next specialist. Primary says the neuro will discuss. Neuro says pulmonary should handle it. Can’t get in to pulmonary until December. He resists everything new until it’s too late like the feeding tube I am so frustrated and depressed. And the not knowing how long we are planning for and what the next steps are has me feeling totally overwhelmed.   Sorry for the vent but it did feel good to let all that dirty laundry out.,False,DadALS,2015-03-16 00:00:00,4594,DX UMND/PLS,2015-06-01 00:00:00,CA,BC,Vancouver,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-dad-has-trouble-accepting-als.42819/

Since she was diagnosed in early August she seems to be progressing quicker than I expected. In 8 weeks she has gone from slight slurring of words and a small limp to basically unintelligible speech and the need for a walker and wheelchair. I'm shocked at how quickly she has declined and then I feel guilty for hoping it keeps progressing quickly to put us all out of this pain and suffering.  I am not her primary caregiver my stepfather is so I don't really know about her medications or the opinions of her doctors. I also feel guilty that I'm not more involved but I work full time and to be honest I'm scared to see her. I have an appointment with a therapist next month which I'm hoping will help sort out the feelings I have.

Then we can plan and pave a path to acceptance (whatever that means) for us and for our kids.   It's crazy that I am hoping that someone will tell me my husband will live for 3 more years. I need to think that we are going to be able to live with this disease for a little while before we die from it.   That's what I need....3 years to my youngest is a long time.

43198,2018-12-07 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,"Unfortunately Thomas no one can calculate that with precision. Limb onset and younger age are as a whole associated with slightly longer survival but from what you describe early progression in the legs may be rapid and progression tends to be rapid as a whole if it's rapid in the beginning though there is often a slower middle.   If you read threads here you will see strategies that can improve both quantity and quality of life such as using mobility devices early to prevent falls using BiPAP as soon as needed keeping up with nutrition/hydration including a feeding tube when needed etc. Getting the necessary legal/financial documentation in place early including end of life wishes can also provide peace of mind.   No one here can offer the expectation of at least 3 years but you can strive every day to provide him with the ability to accomplish what he can in whatever time he has.

42436,2018-09-10 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,Hi Tammy;  We had a loaner electric lift but it became defective and failed during a lift. We had to accept a manual lift. We like it much better. It is smaller has large wheels - better on carpet and I don't have to worry that it will lose power. I have control and do not have worry that the electric will fail in mid lift.

42436,2018-09-10 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,Deciding electric or manual will have a few factors. One of the best things about a forum like this is the range of collective answers. What worked for me with Chris isn't always what will work for everyone so the range of answers really helps make choices.  A small woman looking after a large PALS will need an electric lift because they will be working against actual body weight. My Chris ended up weighing less than me because of the weight loss he went through. I have helped with a friend PALS who was more than a foot taller than me and weighed close to 3 times what Chris did. No way would I ever hoist him without electric and no way would I have managed all day pushing him in a manual chair. I often took Chris out in a manual chair and it seemed nothing to push him around.  Hope that makes sense.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/
42436,2018-09-10 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,I agree with Tillie. Electric or manual is situation dependent.   My PALS my DH is 6'2 and about 225. We originally had a manual hoyer. After a while my arms and back were aching. (I am not an unusually small woman either.) I think part of our problem was that he has a long torso. I needed a lift that would go higher. He is also limb-onset so his limbs are like dead weight. I was ready to order and pay out-of-pocket for an electric lift - then our ALS Association Loan Closet came through with one. It has been much easier for me. I kept the manual in case of emergency. One day we had a battery issue and I had to use the manual. Boy am I glad we got the battery working again!  He has been in a power chair for a while but before that I had a problem pushing him in a manual chair. Not that I couldn't handle the weight but my hands ended up being practically in his armpits!   Again I think it was the long torso issue. Uncomfortable for him and sweaty for me! I found wheelchair handle extensions but by then the Loan Closet again stepped in with a loaner PWC. (Since replaced with his insurance paid chair.)  As others have suggested connect with your local ALS Association and see what they can help you with. They have been a Godsend for us.,True,Jrzygrl,2017-02-14 00:00:00,720,Lost a loved one,2014-08-01 00:00:00,US,NJ,X,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/

41221,2018-05-08 00:00:00,Drained,We seem to be at a similar point. The backup breathing is the only thing he'll need prescribed at some point and therefore we need someone to measure breathing function in the context of ALS.  Questioning everything you do in intervals like clinic therapy anything really can hugely help to get the best care and reduce stress. My PALS decided that he won't prolong speech therapy.

41221,2018-05-20 00:00:00,Drained,Another night when I can't sleep which is ironic because my husband took a turn for the worse this week and we had very little sleep. He is doing better now after adding some new medicine and systems to help with his congestion and breathing. But he couldn't eat any solid food for a couple days so I know he lost weight. He is back to eating again but we are going into the clinic to talk about a feeding tube next week. He is having some difficulty swallowing and I don't want to wait. He seems weaker after this week. He had a chest X-ray and no pneumonia thank goodness.  I also had a local ALS agency suggest I start looking into hospice palliative care. So will start that soon. I am trying to get some nursing help but the paperwork keeps getting messed up between the clinic and the agency. You can't make this stuff up Hopefully it is on track again at least that's what they told me Friday. This week scared me it was hard to know what was going on as he has been relatively stable for a while and went downhill fast. The nurse at the clinic says that happens sometimes. I don't know how I am going to handle this next phase. I asked the clinic for anti anxiety medicine for him as he was very stressed and they just told me to have him use the triology more during the day (he usually just uses it at night) which didn't help. He is willing to do the feeding tube but doesn't want a tracheotomy. The medicine they gave him for his cramps doesn't help either.

If you are paying cash levels of care are irrelevant -- hire on your own and cut out the middleman $ and needless restrictions. You will find threads here on hiring privately.  If you found an aide and he refuses in favor of your five trips a day well you know what you need to do. I don't think your level of care is sustainable and he probably doesn't either. You clearly have unresolved issues with him. They are going to come tumbling out of your mouth at some point not a great future memory so you need a plan for something else. Do you two speak frankly?   I'm not clear on what you want docs to talk about in re the trach if he doesn't want it?

48517,2021-07-30 00:00:00,Caregiving tips and mobility questions,"We modified our bathroom to allow us the ability to roll in and out of it when showering. The first shower chair that insurance provided was a joke. It might have worked with someone that weighed less than 100 pounds... but certainly didn't work for us. Our next shower chair was awesome.  I would get Darcey into the shower chair using the hoyer/sling. I'd then wheel her into the bathroom before removing clothing (which I could easily do while she was in the chair). This chair would also tilt backwards. So I'd tilt her back until she felt comfortable. I'd then get the water temps to her liking BEFORE rolling her into the stream of water. She loved taking showers!   You also asked about a CoughAssist. If we went anywhere we had her Power Wheelchair (PWC) her BiPAP (a Trilogy 100) and the CoughAssist. This was considered ""must have"" for wherever she was. Our first CoughAssist was big and clunky and only worked off of AC. But it worked great. When enough time had passed for it to be replaced we got a 2nd CoughAssist. The newer model had a battery in it (the exact same battery that her Trilogy BiPAP used). It was also pretty much automatic as far as settings.  That 2nd CoughAssist was always at the ready. Because it would run off of its own internal battery it was quick to put into action when needed. And because it only needed to be turned on (with all other settings being auto sensing) it was easy to train someone who might come it to visit and would encourage me to get away while they were there. I can't imagine how we would have managed without a CoughAssist.  We also had a suction machine from pretty early on. We did not use it until the last year of her life. For the most part we found that she could keep phlegm and saliva at bay with the addition of pineapple juice and a morning dose of Alka Seltzer. On occasion she'd also take a mucus pill (generic Mucinex). And she avoided anything ""dairy"".  I hope you are able to find something within this post that is a help.  My best...

43493,2019-01-15 00:00:00,Getting Help Caregivers,We have a mix of ways that we have help. I thought I'd share them. I'd also be interested in hearing your ideas.  For reference my Dad is mostly immobile now (diagnosed the end of 2018.) All transfers are with a Hoyer lift. He does get transferred to a commode or his PWC (mostly if we're leaving the house these days.) He's no longer swallowing and has a feeding tube. He has bipap but mostly uses it at night. He's almost completely lost his voice.  - ALS respite: We have 18 hours a month of respite through ALS. We use them for caregivers to come to the house and give Dad baths and do his range of motion exercises two mornings a week.  - Volunteers from church: We have a nurse from church who volunteered to come one morning a week so my Mom can get out of the house and do some shopping.  - Friends: I have a friend who has done home care. She also comes one morning a week to help.  - Friend in nursing school: She comes two mornings a week for baths and exercises. She also comes Monday - Wednesday evenings for getting ready for bed.  This leaves Sunday morning and Thursday-Saturday evenings for me to cover.  In addition between me or my friend who is studying to be a nurse - one of us is always on call. My husband and I are temporarily renting a townhouse within five minutes of Mom &amp; Dad. She lives within 15 minutes. So if I need to leave the area I make sure that she can cover them if they need help.  I know that there are websites that you can use to organize helpers. Maybe someone can remind us of what they are? We haven't done that. It's one thing to have someone buy groceries for you. It's a completely different thing to ask if they are OK with helping with toileting.   I know more help can be available if you're a veteran. My Dad isn't. Maybe someone with more knowledge can chime in.  There was a lot of talk of hospice at the beginning. We haven't gone that route yet. I do think we probably have all the equipment that we need now. It's likely getting closer. But it's a definite change of mindset.  In our case some help is paid while others do not want any compensation. We have avoided paying through any agency. I realize there are benefits; having a back up background checks etc. Of course you pay extra for that too.  I feel extremely blessed at the amount of help that we have.

When he can't drink the smoothies or when he starts aspirating (it took three cases of pneumonia to convince my husband that he was aspirating) then you either put formula in the tube or blend food for him.

If your PALS doesn't actively want to ""keep it short"" and declines all interference with nature's way the feeding tube is a lifesaver.   My PALS got his tube this winter and would be dead without it even though he got is before losing weight drastically. It's little maintenance/care much less work than keeping hydrated. Fluids were a real problem quickly after that. He ate with great appetite for two more month until he had two choking episodes and basically gave it up. I'm so glad there never had to be a choice between survival and safety. No pneumonia so far hope I can keep him out of the hospital forever.  And it's not like he's being hijacked.

Got him home from Dr. (we live almost 150 miles from VA) said he was tired and went to bed. Everything went sideways from there. He has been running very high temps and chills so bad he almost shakes himself out of the bed. Started giving him Tylenol and the fevers are down but still shaking like crazy and says he is freezing.

Some are from a not so accessible world and some are somewhat self imposed.  For example DD got her first apartment. Her job is in one of the most expensive areas of the country. The choice came down to renting a first floor apartment in a scketchy area or a second floor condo in a safer area. No brainer but we can't visit. DS is at college and lives on the 3rd floor of an older dorm with no elevator. The school makes accommodations for students with disabilities but cannot make them for students with disabled family members. Friends have been so gracious to invite us to celebrations of various events. Most have been held at their homes. They don't own accessible homes so we haven't been able to attend.   DH is wheelchair bound and can no longer stand. He will not travel by plane. Our last flight when he could still walk a short distance turned a 2 hour trip into a 12 hour fiasco so he is not willing to take a chance like that again and I can't blame him. He also has lost the use of his arms so I now feed him his meals. He will not go out to eat because he feels like he'll be on display. I can't ask him to put himself in a situation where he'd be that uncomfortable so we always eat at home. These limitations are self-imposed but he has lost so much I will not push.  I'm not looking for grand adventures anymore. Just what most would consider a ""normal"" day would be a blessing.

Remember that this disease may be affecting his cognition and executive functioning very likely so. Unless he was always the way you describe it could well be the case. On top of that this disease can be quite terrifying for the person whose body is failing a bit more and more every day.   It is very hard but maybe you can find a way to help him live some quality of life now and make some memories. Is there no way he can live with you so that you can provide easier back up care and pay for help to come in?  What will happen when he is totally dependent?  It used to take around 8 hours a day just to provide the basic care to my husband.  You can read back heaps of information here. Also check out the important threads at the top of the general forum. Then ask away and we will try to help you navigate through. A great thing about here is that we have members who have experienced pretty much all variations of situations so you can usually get a great range of responses.

42819,2018-10-11 00:00:00,My dad has trouble accepting ALS,Re: My husband trouble accepting ALS   Hi and welcome.  My husband was Dx in 07 vented in ‘10. He lives here at home with me and I am his primary caregiver. I pretty much am 24/7/365. Our children are now adults 31 24 but my daughter was just ready to turn 13 when he was formerly Dx. We had been trying to find out the issue for 2.5 years prior. Both of my kids pitch in as they can. Currently DD is away at PT school. DS is here 2 afternoons for a couple of hours and on his off day on Friday’s.  I know exactly how hard it is. DH has been bed bound for a few years now but work was just as tough when he was still getting up and moving around even while on the vent.  If there is anyway you could bring her into your home and then hire someone from outside to help it would probably be more cost effective and you would not need to make 5 daily trips.  Being angry with your Dad for things he did or should have done is useless and will only cause you pain after he’s gone. What’s done is done. You need to concentrate on the here and now and what you can do to turn things around.  My parents are in Long Term Care one in the Memory unit so I know how much time visiting takes up. Esp when I have a nurse 1 day and my son 1 day I feel like that is all I do.  Tillie has giving you lots of good info so I won’t repeat but feel free to ask away I will try to answer as I can.

I understand your anger but holding onto it is not good for you mentally or physically. Of course you are welcome to come here and to vent. I am glad that it helped just to get it out. I'm sure it's hard being new to the area. There are some ALS support groups that meet. I hope that you can find a way to forgive. Time is short. He's already lost over 100lbs.   Is it possible he is resisting help because what he wants right now is family? Could you two sit down and talk about it? Is there a way for him to know he has your emotional support but for you to also have the help that will be needed? Is hospice a possibility? Would that provide more help? I am just thinking out loud. Working together maybe there is a way for peace to be restored and for both of your needs to be met.  I know the future can be terrifying with this disease.

43493,2019-01-16 00:00:00,Getting Help Caregivers,"Hello I can share with you my situation especially since my mother's physical condition sounds somewhat similar to your father's except she does not have a feeding tube and we're pursuing bipap right now with an assessment planned in the next 2 weeks. She lives in a studio apartment in my apartment building so she's just a 2-minute run down the stairs or a quick elevator ride away. She spends all of her time in bed except for commode for ""big business"" and washing up in the morning. We're trying to get her to use her comfie lift chair making some headway on her considering it but she thinks it's exhausting just to be transferred.  I live in a big city so we have a few more resources. From the province my mother receives support from an attendant services programme which assists in the activities of daily living for people living with disability. From them we get 1.5 hours in morning for toileting and breakfast and dressing. An hour at lunch for brief change and making simple lunch getting her set up for the afternoon. An hour at dinner brief change and heating Meals on Wheels or other prepared dinner and getting her comfortable for the evening. And an hour at 8pm for bedbath brief change and getting ready for night. The hour at dinner is a short-term thing 3 months which they're giving as respite for me as we transition into this programme. There are clusters of people in this area so the PSWs roam around and provide services.  We'll be getting more services on our own dime as we need more help. The PSWs we hire will be somewhat subsidized by government programmes and come at $17/hour for minimum 2 hours. Right now morning care is excellent and the rest are adequate. I fill in whenever else she needs but she sleeps most of the morning another nap in afternoon and then sleeps from 10-5 or 6am and is happy to be on her own.  My sister is providing homemade lunches for her and I have occasional homemade dinners for variety. My sister comes to spend Sunday afternoons with her from another town. We have no other active support. I have had some friends offer to sit with her but she doesn't need that kind of help. I kind of feel like if you can't change a brief it's not much help. I figure I spend on average another 3 hours with her per day coordinating with caregivers filling in when they are late or don't show up ordering supplies and personal care. So I calculate daily she's needing 7.5 hours per day. Even my respite if it's not for something practical like a PSW making a dinner and doing a brief change it's no real help for me. Maybe I'm over-zealous but they'd be asking her a hundred and one questions and talking is exhausting for her.   I've been doing this for a month now and I was surprised at how much this is taking out of me (she's 87 I'm 60). Just the set up of her independant apartment in my building really exhausted me. We're over that hump now and things are running pretty well. I'm on a pretty short string though with no backup for emergency trips to the bathroom for a BM so I can't go too far (more than 15 min. drive away) without some anxiety so I'm curtailing my activities and ordering more stuff in for delivery. Luckily I can walk to a grocery store 5 minutes away. I know we're in for even more rocky stressful times as she progresses. But I'll just have to take that as it comes. If we need a night nurse we'll hire one.  Hope that helps.

I'm breaking down right now with sadness for my PALS the loss of my dear sister and feeling overwhelmed about BiPap settings the start of wee pressure sores on the tops of my Mum's toes the fact that she's having trouble with her food the homemade Slippery Sally sewing experiment went pear-shaped and doesn't work and in general I feel like I'm overwhelmed. For the moment.   I love your idea of keeping things out of the inner ring moving it up to the outer ring. I agree. Its a good visual reminder...Thanks for sharing this. You ask how do we deal with it? It is lonely. It does feel like it's most on my head. If I share it with someone else I just feel like I'm droning on about a laundry list of heart-aches and it doesn't really help me to relive all the details and I think it's hard on the listener: they can't help too much. I'm also careful of going on in detail to people younger than me...do they really need to hear about the grisly details of looking after a loved one with some hard disease? Maybe they can stay light and breezy for a while. And talking about this with some outer-ring friends at dinner last night it's a real wet blanket...and it didn't make me feel any better. I think in future I'll just keep it vague.  It's a great thing to have this forum. I think the answer is I have a great husband who supports me by making me dinners and looking after some of the household things for me I have a good doctor I can talk to she's in reserve.

43541,2019-01-22 00:00:00,The Lonely Burden of Not Dumping In.,Great topic Thomas. Several thoughts from my perspective as a PALS ...  The model of “support in dump out” is interesting. But I see the situation as being more dynamic. You and your loved one are going through this journey together though each in a different way. There are times where you’ll be caregiver/patient and the model of support in dump out will apply. Then there will be other times where you’ll be loving partners and soulmates who will feel comfortable sharing everything with one another. And then there’s everything in between.  My advice would be to acknowledge that this pendulum swings back and forth and all around and to see it as fluid rather than absolute taking some comfort in knowing there are times when it’s easier to share more equally and intimately and times when it’s not.  During those times when you don’t feel it’s appropriate to share your frustrations with your PALS it’s good to have support groups (including this forum) close friends and maybe a counselor where it is safe to dump/ vent/ rant.  Then there is the lonely burden of not dumping out.  I think everyone is at the center of their own grief circle. When I told family friends and colleagues about my ALS diagnosis it occurred to me that each person who got the news had to process it their own way whether they were immediate family or an acquaintance. I found myself needing to be sensitive to their processing and the nature of their relationship with me.  Sometimes I don’t feel like burdening my CALS and others with all the details of my misery and concerns for fear it will burn out my CALS (who has her own sh&amp;t to deal with) and drive my friends away. So that’s the lonely burden of not dumping out.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/the-lonely-burden-of-not-dumping-in.43541/

I am not a religious person but this Jewish Rabbi also gives CALS/PALS relationship advice. His advice is to discuss the problems differences and other feelings. My CAL is not quite able to do this yet and it is sometimes a problem. My advice is to be open and honest about your feelings and your relationship. Things hidden can fester.,True,dldugan,2018-10-05 00:00:00,203,PALS,2018-09-01 00:00:00,US,illinois,Mahomet,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/the-lonely-burden-of-not-dumping-in.43541/
43541,2019-01-22 00:00:00,The Lonely Burden of Not Dumping In.,Thomas I walked the road of CALS for 14 years. Some of those decent years some extremely hard. During that time I found that never expressing to my PALS how I felt wasn’t always the best approach. You have to remember that the entire immediate family and some friends but especially the main CAL is dealing with ALS even though it’s their PAL with the DX. I had to explain that to my DH. Yes he was the one in the bed on the vent with the DX but didn’t mean that it didn’t feel like I didn’t have that exact same DX. However I also told him that while it was impossible for me to know exactly how he was feeling it was also impossible for him to know what I was feeling. And just because I wasn’t in the bed it didn’t mean I didn’t hurt or my life was all sunshine and roses.  Trust me as this disease moves forward your husband will probably become more and more self centered and if you don’t let him know it’s bothering you he won’t even consider that a possibility. While I didn’t do it often I did break down in tears. Mostly when I felt like he thought I wasn’t doing enough or doing things right. I also had times when I hollered as well. You need to be honest with him.

43541,2019-01-22 00:00:00,The Lonely Burden of Not Dumping In.,This is an interesting concept. Personally I have found that is a refreshing relief to have an outer ring of acquaintances who don’t even know of our situation. It’s nice to feel “normal” because once everyone knows I feel like it’s always on people’s minds when they see me. I might just feel like that because it’s always on my mind who knows? With my PALS I think it’s important to continue our relationship in the same way as it was before- if something is bothering me I talk to him about it. I’m not going to walk on eggshells that insults him as an adult and also devalues me as the partner.,True,diagnosed2016,2016-04-30 00:00:00,190,Lost a loved one,2016-07-01 00:00:00,US,CA,California,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/the-lonely-burden-of-not-dumping-in.43541/

41221,2018-05-24 00:00:00,Drained,Went for PEG consult P.A. Said it only takes 5 minutes but the will use general anesthesia and no trilogy. They will keep him overnight for observation but then he will be good to go no pain no nausea. We don't get to meet the surgeon as he is too busy they said. She said they would explain how to use it it to him after the procedure. I reminded her that he has ALS and can't do it himself so I will need to be with him when that happens.  She didn't seem to know much about what happens afterwards so my husband told her he would wait to make the decision until after he talks to his Neuro and nutritionist next week. In spite of this when we got home they had scheduled the procedure for next week without our knowkedge. They gave us no surgery prep instructions and as far as I know have not gotten it approved by our insurance company. When I have had general anesthesia in the last I as at least told not to eat the day of the procedure. My husband told me to call and cancel it as he feels he needs more info and he is eating ok now and his breathing is obove the levels they need so there is no rush.  She said it is just like going to the dentist.

41221,2018-05-25 00:00:00,Drained,We advise having the procedure done in radiology (where it's done by an interventional radiologist) so that a general is not needed and he can use the Trilogy. That is often considered the standard for ALS esp. where there is respiratory impairment and there is no GI reason that it has to be done in surgery (e.g. if your husband had a pre-existing stomach issue).   Since you guys were funneled to GI instead I will assume that wherever you are going the surgeons rule the roost on this one. It is often a matter of territory. That they scheduled on spec is not surprising either. But you have the option to call the ALS clinic and ask for an interventional radiology referral.   General anesthesia is more of a risk than not for anyone let alone a PALS. I would ask them to justify this one Anne and even if you agree with the reasoning you have the absolute right to meet the surgeon and should. You should know the experience with neuromuscular disease of anyone who does anything interventional on your husband ever.   For some people here to answer your question it has been a cakewalk and for others the exact opposite. To get the best odds on that definitely takes more planning and forethought than you have described and you need a more ALS-specific discussion.   Where in Houston are you getting this done? There are definitely IR departments there! Also remember you have multiple choices in the TMC and elsewhere depending on your network. You do not have to get this done at the same place as your clinic.

41221,2018-05-25 00:00:00,Drained,I wouldn't let any surgeon who was 'too busy to meet me' touch me let alone my PALS.  It really is a simple procedure - but our PALS are not the average patient and deserve a little extra thought and consultation.  Definitely bring it up with your neuro and request to be set up for a RIG which is the way they insert the same feeding tube.

41221,2018-05-25 00:00:00,Drained,My PALS got a PEG and because of ALS general anesthesia was a no go for the neurologist setting things up at the clinic. They put him in twilight sleep with Propvol for a couple minutes he remembers nothing and came to very quickly after the placement. I got to pick him up right where it happend and he was quite exuberant because of the drug and because he was still alive. He was quite concerned beforehand and people keep reassuring us that it's indeed more like getting a piercing than a proper operation.   He didn't meet the gastro docs who did it beforehand they get shuttled in by taxi cab from the building on the other side of the street every Monday to poke holes in PALS real busy rockstars.

43444,2019-01-09 00:00:00,Depressed,May I ask how do these antidepressants make you all feel? I was once on tricyclic antidepressants for nerve pain and it made me feel like there was a film of fog on everything. I felt like an automaton. They worked on the pain though. Hard to come off them. Took months of titrating down. Another time maybe 20 years ago I was on some that made me feel very dead inside. I actually had one moment on them where I felt so black so consumed by a wall of blackness (a feeling that I'd never had when I was *just* depressed) that if I had the means I would have killed myself. That was the antidepressant from 20 years ago. I came off them and had this crazy moment of utter clarity and never had depression again. My GP is recommending them for me now due to my recent bereavement and recurrent periods of exhaustion. I feel like my reaction to caregiving is understandable. I'm sad. It feels hard and sad. But I'm really reluctant. Everyone is saying they're good and helpful. I'm really nervous.

43444,2019-01-09 00:00:00,Depressed,I hate to sound like a worn out record but have you tried Remeron? None of the SSRIs helped me. GPs usually don't prescribe Remeron they stick to SSRIs or if you are in a lot of physical pain might try tricyclic.  Remeron can actually give you more energy at higher doses but it has a very calming effect at lower doses.   If you are still depressed being on a SSRI maybe counseling and a visit to a psychiatrist for a med check are in order.,True,KimT,2014-11-18 00:00:00,4148,PALS,2015-08-01 00:00:00,US,South,The Beach,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/depressed.43444/

I'm assuming he doesn't have any skin lesions since you didn't mention any. I would also start to record data like pulse and BP during the feverish episodes along with notes about any skin color changes sweating breathing etc.   Remember to phrase this as ""I statements"" and let him save face by asking that he do it as a favor to you and any other family that he cares about.

41449,2018-05-02 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,I get the part about being content staying home. (Downside is that I'm not content with it  )  My boyfriend weighs the pros and cons of going out and if the payoff isn't great like last week seeing a favorite band talking with the musicians and getting a free shirt he's more inclined to not invest so much energy and rather stay home. That's where friends are the best thing in the world. They stop by watch shows with him and sometimes that gives me opportunity to slip out to go swimming or see other friends. It helps me that we used to go out on our own both being pretty independent. We were never clingy.   And yet it breaks my heart that now that it's finally warm enough to sit on the patio of restaurants (because so very few are accessible here) he's no longer able to eat. That was my promise all through winter while tucking him into blanket and gloves: in spring we can go anywhere with just a shirt on and we'll try all the restaurants in the area we moved to. Well... ALS was quicker again.   Again I try to figure out what we need to enjoy NOW because there won't be a later. In fall I told him to eat a lot of potato chips that was pretty spot on.   How can one learn to look beyond the most recent loss guess what's vanishing soon and enjoy that without being prematurely sad about the inescapability?  I find that reading about others who are farther down the road (or on another road altogether) helps me focus on everything that's NOT a problem. My PALS has no cramps and not spasms pain is manageable he sleeps tight he can hold his head fairly well and there's still a naughty twinkle in his eyes. Others might look as his journey how he's become a quadriplegic in only a year how he lost most of his speech in the last couple months. You could either see the horror of what's to come or see what your PALS is spared of at the moment or might never have to deal with.   I sometimes am very much surprised by what other PALS can still do years after diagnosis and it hits me hard. Most times I don't even envy slower progression. I feel I'm doing pretty well as a CALS.

They do the heavy lifting and some are wonderful but too many things just don't get done well. Last night her brief came unstuck and she woke up in a puddle in the morning. I'm suspecting one of them cannot read. One never locks the door when she leaves. None of them consult the care plan I wrote out for her. Oh actually that's all the same PSW! And she's pretty vulnerable due to her poor speech and mood. Sometimes I imagine what it might have been like to live on a farm where your obligations are daily scheduled stressful relentless unavoidable. I think it's just going to be my life while she's still with us. So far she's okay through the night on her own. She can still call me and I almost never understand what the issue is so I pop downstairs in person. She also has the Freedom Alert system a pendant which works with her existing phone system which I highly recommend.

I get meals from Healthy Chef. They are organic vacuum sealed and delivered each Friday. The portions are huge. We have a service from our local grocery store that delivers groceries but I've not yet used it as I can still drive.  Our local pharmacy offers free delivery.  I've written out all the meds and vitamins/supplements I take and organized the cupboards so someone can easily take over when needed.  I got all my durable medical equipment very early on and did the remodel as soon as I moved so all that is done.  I have no family but have some wonderful friends. I plan on hiring some caregivers that work here in my condo and also some from an agency when the time comes.  I trust the service that cleans my house. I've known them for years and they understand my issues. My friend takes my dog to the groomer on a regular basis.  I recently found that they started a new transport system for PWC patients that is free for doctors' appointments.

43493,2019-01-18 00:00:00,Getting Help Caregivers,You might want to explore hiring CNAs from your local college. Some of them are in the bridge program to become LPNs or RNs. It would give them good experience on their resumes and reliable ones will want a letter of recommendation.  I'm not a big fan of Craig's list. We have a local hometown news and there are always CNAs available. Their going rate here in Florida is $12 an hour. The cargivers who work in my building charge $15 but they are very dependable. Companies usually charge over $20 an hour at least down here.  You'd think ALS clinics would be a good source of referrals for home health care but in my experience they are not.

Google CNA trade schools universities and community colleges that have any combination of pre-professional and nursing PT OT RT programs and you will find how to post to their job boards. Some are free and for others there's a small fee.   We did dip our toes into Craigslist and the local ALSA list initially with essentially horrifying results. At a minimum I would run a criminal background check on anyone who characterized themselves as a professional caregiver as opposed to a verifiable student. And of course you can verify CNA and other credentials on line with the State for anyone for free.   As for care.com I know at least one person who's listed there and the same considerations would apply including reference checks.  The most important thing is this: Recruiting any caregiving help through any means requires the willingness to zap people who don't work out which we did more than once. If you don't have that make sure someone in your orbit does.

A good deal of the time that will include your PALS.   Otherwise you are consigning your relationship to ""caregiver/patient"" which is far more lonely to your point.

Also it's completely normal to feel depressed when dealing with loss on this scale. Antidepressants are a welcome crutch for situations where there simply is no solution.  Maybe there are some small factors in a caregiver's life that can be improved. Anyone who helps with the normal day to day can be a huge relief.

43444,2019-01-09 00:00:00,Depressed,Just to clarify if anyone is confused since we frequently have PALS using trazodone and other TCAs typically they are using them in low doses for sleep and secondarily get the benefit of drying secretions. So they are not using them at the dosages that they would be used for depression a use for which they indeed are considered passé because the risk/benefit ratio for the higher doses is not there.   In that context it is worth considering for both CALS and PALS that poor sleep can result in a muddled state that seems like/can magnify depression as well as pain and a low-dose TCA is a potentially viable alternative to popping Ambien and similar drugs (that can foster dependence and next-day sedation) every night.   Of course if sleep is an issue there are other approaches to try ahead of drugs -- from a low voltage heated mattress pad (can use under the mattress or overlay if liquids are an issue) to meditation. But for CALS there are never enough hours in the day or night and being moderately coherent is important to taking care of your PALS.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/depressed.43444/

41449,2018-05-12 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,So it’s getting really real around here. The Doctor okayed Brian for hospice. Yes I know and appreciate that it will get us more help. I know and appreciate that he could spend 18 months with Hospice or even more many ALS patients do by getting extensions every six months.  They are coming to our place Tuesday to set up initial paperwork etc. Tuesday is Brian’s 68th birthday which makes us more fortunate than many here. He is two years from Dx as of June 30th so what could we expect I guess.  Brian’s arms are getting weaker.henonly uses the walker to transfer now. He chooses to live in his recliner when not in bed at night. I still have people with him just a part of each day while I work. We have a groovy special urinal type he can still use that has a bag that takes a day to fill and for bowel He can transfer to the toilet in the morning before I go I wipe and flush and navigate the transfer. Obviously having people just a part of each day will need to move to all day soon.  I changed supervisors at work and my new one scares me. His main concern when I explained about my husband seemed to be making sure I was at work enough ( I said that I sometimes leave a few hours early for appointments related to my husband’s ALS and that my former boss did not expect me to use PTO for that as long as it was less than 1/2 day. He said I needed to make up that time in the same week. I am a salaried person and never work less than 40 and rarely less than 45 hours a week). In addition it was our first face to face meeting and he mentioned that I had disagreed with something negative on my last review. My last review was good. I actually am concerned he wants to push me out as a liability to the organization because Brian is sick. I am meeting with his boss Monday.  Oh and for double your joy said new supervisor when told my husband has ALS said “Oh like Lou Gehrig’s? The ice bucket challenge?”. He also noted that “ He had his kids and I have my husband” at home. Yup because your dying husband in your living room is just like having kids who are going to grow up and have lives. No words.  Anyway that happened Thursday and I am considering my words carefully for Monday. I feel much better than I did yesterday about that part.  Hardest time of my life so far no peace on any front but I will persevere. What else can I do?,True,Lkaibel,2016-05-09 00:00:00,1467,Lost a loved one,2016-06-01 00:00:00,US,MN,Minneapolis,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hold-on-tight.41449/page-2

Bring a copy of your last review to signal you're playing for keeps and remember that the ADA prohibits treating you differently than any other employee based on your ""association"" with someone with a disability.   So if another employee was or would be allowed to stagger her 40 hours for any reason other than Brian's medical appointments like if she had child care issues or her car was being fixed then by law the same flexibility must be provided to you. There should also be something in your employee manual relative to the PTO requirement for &lt;1/2 day for exempt employees but it's moot if the company has been abrogating it.   I'll throw in my own clueless person story. Someone asked me yesterday if ALS was neurological and I said yes.

Even if you don't pull it out having it with you is critical.  I know that every step down the path is another in the 1000 deaths we face and grieve and while we find all the positives no one can be excited to register with hospice - I get it!

43541,2019-01-24 00:00:00,The Lonely Burden of Not Dumping In.,I think one of the things that makes this so hard for both PALS and CALS is that these are uncharted waters. The model of being in an equal relationship of partners/ spouses is established and couples need only put their own spin on it.   However going back and forth between being equal partners of a couple and being caregiver/ patient is much less defined and raises so many more variables. We create the rules as we go and they don’t always work.  How much do we share when are we allowed to complain do we risk offending or alienating the other person? These are all difficult questions.   For many conditions which are not as overwhelming and comprehensive as ALS it may work best if the daughter can just be the daughter or the spouse can just be the spouse and hire someone else to do the caregiving. But since ALS eventually overtakes every aspect of a person’s function it’s not so clear cut.  I hear you Thomas. We’re all swimming these waters together.

43541,2019-01-25 00:00:00,The Lonely Burden of Not Dumping In.,Hi Thomas  Though we received my husband’s diagnosis two years before yours every time I read one of your posts they hit so close to home and touch on exactly what I have felt or been feeling.  Shortly after my husband's diagnosis his cousin shared the same Ring Theory article (also this one  an interview with Sheryl Sandburg on building resilience ).  Though it very much resonated with me as your post has highlighted it needs some wiggle room especially when the spouse is the center ring.  My PALS is my husband my soulmate my parenting partner my go-to person for everything from the mundane to the major. He knows me better than anyone and I know him better than anyone. So as others have said I think it is fair to “dump” in…at least within reason. And I've also felt the loneliness of dumping out and though its great to have such amazing friends to listen I hate feeling like a person who is always complaining out.  In addition to the challenge of where to “dump” fear/grief/sadness two other “dumping in” challenges encountered as we have travelled this journey:  Putting aside all the ALS-related crap we are all facing there is all the “normal” life stuff that is still happens and which can also really suck at times…teenagers to raise with all the drama and parenting challenges they present extended family issues and dynamics household maintenance (he used to do all the work around the house or at least know how to get it done now its all me…though I had a good teacher!) etc.   I’ve had well-meaning friends tell me not to burden my PALS with day-to-day issues / complaints “don’t upset him; he is sick and should not have to worry about that”. But my PALS has always been an involved husband father son etc and he has always been my/the whole family’s go-to person for everything. If I don’t go to him it ALL falls on me which is unfair both to me and to him - it undermines him as a partner and takes away who he is as a person.   He may no longer be able to walk or talk or move but for as long as he is alive I want him to be able to be the spouse and parent and son and friend he always has been.  The other big challenge is when people “dump in” to me. This can range from friends who struggle with his diagnosis and need to process it by telling me how awful it is to see this happening to him the nicest guy and how it is so much worse than X or Y disease.   Or at the extreme end are issues with his family who are obviously distraught but really don’t have any idea about what we have going through but they fill in the blanks by misinterpreting things and then attack me. Puts me in an awkward position since I understand their pain and need to find a place to put it but don’t deserve to be their punching bag….my only options are to either “dump in” to my PALS or suck it up.,True,Turtals,2018-12-11 00:00:00,18,CALS,2016-12-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Newton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/the-lonely-burden-of-not-dumping-in.43541/
43541,2019-01-26 00:00:00,The Lonely Burden of Not Dumping In.,So much of what you wrote hits home with me too. When PALS is a co-parent I think it poses different challenges. My husband and I are truly partners and have lived that way since we started dating. I have a difficult family and we decided long ago that I (we) didn't need them because he is my person and I am his person. He is my family....we had a deal. And now well I am most likely going to lose him 20-30 years before I thought I was. That is a hard reality for me and also as I have said breaks my heart. And I am so sad for him as he deals with his reality that he is not going to be here for a future we have worked so hard to build. I am working on being strong for him when he needs it -- he needs me to be strong right now. And I will be... but there does need to be a time for us to mourn what we know we are losing. We are both realists which is good and bad.   Putting aside all the ALS-related crap we are all facing there is all the “normal” life stuff that is still happens and which can also really suck at times…teenagers to raise with all the drama and parenting challenges they present extended family issues and dynamics household maintenance...  -- I completely agree with this too.  But my PALS has always been an involved husband father son etc and he has always been my/the whole family’s go-to person for everything. If I don’t go to him it ALL falls on me which is unfair both to me and to him - it undermines him as a partner and takes away who he is as a person.   -- This is good to remember...  He may no longer be able to walk or talk or move but for as long as he is alive I want him to be able to be the spouse and parent and son and friend he always has been.  -- This is my goal too.  The other big challenge is when people “dump in” to me. This can range from friends who struggle with his diagnosis and need to process it by telling me how awful it is to see this happening to him the nicest guy and how it is so much worse than X or Y disease.   -- This is where the ring theory has to come in -- No one should dump into you...you are in the center ring too....  Or at the extreme end are issues with his family who are obviously distraught but really don’t have any idea about what we have going through but they fill in the blanks by misinterpreting things and then attack me.   -- Awesome just what you need -- I'm so sorry.   Puts me in an awkward position since I understand their pain and need to find a place to put it but don’t deserve to be their punching bag….my only options are to either “dump in” to my PALS or suck it up.  -- Yes you do understand their pain but geesh you do not deserve this at all.,True,Thomas933,2018-12-04 00:00:00,91,CALS,2018-12-01 00:00:00,Uni,RI,Providence,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/the-lonely-burden-of-not-dumping-in.43541/

I'm thinking of cutting the baclofen dose in half to see if we can find a balance. He has also tried CBD oil which I think helps a little bit. He does his stretches and goes to PT 2x a week.

43722,2019-02-14 00:00:00,My dad is still kicking but recently got the flu.,Hello  Sorry I've been away from the forum for a long time. Two teenagers one baby and full time care of my dad (shared with my mom) was tough.. And then... We decided to move from the USA to Finland. It was my husband's idea actually... He dragged us in June 2018 because he thought we could somewhat get our lives back here. Nursing homes in Finland are amazing so we put my dad in one that is right downstairs our apartment complex.   So yes our lives did get better. 15 well trained nurses started taking care of my dad instead of me and my mom while we still can visit any time of the day for quality time. My dad got much better too it was the greatest half a year possible given his condition.  But a couple of weeks ago my dad got a flu. And he doesn't seem to be able to recover. He has lots of congestion his CRP is 12 though so no bacterial infection but we are all very worried he's going to get pneumonia.   I came back here for support.... I don't know what to expect now. My dad hasn't have an upper respiratory infection since his diagnosis in Oct 2017 so we haven't been through this yet. His oxygen is still 94 but he's pretty much completely lost all of his muscles by now.   He refuses any medication or food since he's not feeling well and is generally very sad and probably scared...  Is it possible for a PALS to get over a flu when they are completely bed ridden already? He can't swallow or cough anymore he can't talk. He has a vast cough assist bipap.

You have to make sure it has the "" T"" in title as these are cut for a trach and have no adhesive. Unfortunately they are quite expensive around $65 for a box of 10.

There is no clear-cut pattern -- it is possible that there will be limb and respiratory problems pretty much around the same time or not. I know that is vague but we can't predict. It is good to keep up with breathing tests but also to listen to how she breathes especially while asleep and to stay ahead of needing any mobility devices like a walker. You and she rather than any book are the best early indicator of what she needs next especially with FTD.  I'm very sorry you are both faced with this.

43554,2019-02-07 00:00:00,Bulbar and Ftd,Laurie Thanks for the reply. In our case the beast was beginning to go to legs but still good movement with arms. Yes she passed feb4th in my arms my sister and her personal dr present past couple mos pretty bad with saliva and mucous but the end was very easy. No gasping for air. Pulse got weaker and weaker. Then passed. I’ve been reading on forum for about 6 mos and sure do appreciate everyone. I’m 70;so not very good at this stuff I would like to say that there is a possibility that your loved ones can go peacefully at the end. I’m so thankful for that.

43725,2019-02-15 00:00:00,Protecting Against Heel Sores,Hi Katy  Nice lotion or coconut oil and massage those heels every couple of hours thru the day and as often as possible in when bed.

43725,2019-02-15 00:00:00,Protecting Against Heel Sores,I developed sores on my heels after spending a lot of time in bed over a 2 month period (respiratory infection).  In desperation I simply wore a pair of lightweight tennis shoes to bed. It took over a month for the heel sores to clear up but they eventually did.  I am sure a special purpose boot would work better but it was easier to use the tennis shoes I had laying around unused.

43725,2019-02-15 00:00:00,Protecting Against Heel Sores,We modded the Prevalon pressure boots which address both forward droop and lateral tilt if you connect them with a sash and customize side support. I wouldn't use a terrycloth towel because of abrasion concerns. If L/R movement is not an issue you could also use travel size bed pillows such as they have at BBN.  My husband had edema and diabetes so regular shoes would not have worked.   When you say keeping feet up during the day are you talking about a wheelchair or...? We always used socks and often foam in the wheelchair foot rests.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/protecting-against-heel-sores.43725/

Well he has this terrible reflux so he refuses to get into his chair as he wants to stay in the only position that he finds comfortable which is half reclined in his bed. He got his tailbone hurting a lot but he still prefers this position. We can't find a good combination of drugs for his reflux as we are adjusting to the differences in medication in Finland. The feeding tube is narrower here so the omeprazol capsules slow release do not go through the tube anymore! And he needed to get his tube changed here... Ughh since then we can't get his reflux under control...   His bed is very nice though he can control the multiple recline options with a tap of a finger that he can still somewhat do or the nurses help and the mattress does the massage to prevent bed sores. He also has the eye gaze to communicate now.   I'm so glad that your sister made it through the sickness Yes it is so rough since this can be so dangerous....

43722,2019-02-14 00:00:00,My dad is still kicking but recently got the flu.,Welcome back and I’ll glad to hear the move to Finland was helpful at least for a while.  Here’s a thread on colds:   https://www.alsforums.com/forum/gen...y-pals-getting-cold-help.html?highlight=Colds   Yes reflux can lead to aspiration which can create more problems with his lungs. There are forms of Omeprazole which can be given by tube. Here’s what I found in my online medical textbook:  Nasogastric/Gastric tube: Oral suspension (using packets): Add 5 mL of water to a catheter tipped syringe and then add contents of a 2.5 mg packet (or 15 mL of water for the 10 mg packet). Immediately shake syringe and leave to thicken for 2 to 3 minutes; shake syringe again and within 30 minutes administer via NG or gastric tube (French size 6 or larger). Refill syringe with an equal amount of water shake and flush remaining contents through NG or gastric tube Oral suspension (using capsules): The manufacturer of Prilosec does not give recommendations for extemporaneous preparation of omeprazole capsules for NG/OG administration. Consider using the packets for oral suspension.    I realize that sounds complicated. I think that if you are able to talk to a pharmacist they can inform you on what preparations of Omeprazole and similar drugs (known as Proton Pump Inhibitors) are available in Finland for use with a tube.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-dad-is-still-kicking-but-recently-got-the-flu.43722/
43722,2019-02-14 00:00:00,My dad is still kicking but recently got the flu.,I had a lot of breakthrough reflux with Prilosec and some of the other PPIs. Has he ever tried Aciphex? That was the only PPI that allowed me to eat chocolate again. I had horrible GERD so bad it caused my heart to flutter all night long. I had to sleep sitting up until I started Aciphex. The pill I take is time released but it is extremely small.  Your pharmacist will know all the options. When I want answers I call a pharmacy in Canada because they are much more willing to spend time on the phone and solve problems. I suspect Finland is similar. Give it a try.  Before Aciphex I aspirated several times and even without ALS it was very scary and I ended up coughing for hours after.

But sounds like you are beginning to have a handle on it. It will take time but it will get easier with practice and time. One of the next things you will probably learn and have to deal with...is the suction machines you get for home use are not near as strong/effective as the hospital suction. You will want to have more than one unit at home or we did. One for the room where he spends most of his time and another for the bedside. And it is good that one of them is kinda portable so with a converter you can use it in a vehicle. Suctioning needs come at the dangdest of times. And yes its nasty...but you will learn to overlook that too...just as you have lots of other things by now. Again U R AWESOME!

The MICU was full and folks were busy so I hovered and used my teacher training to model how she needed to handle my husband. SHe settled down a bit but I spent the night watching her. I made a comment early in the morning about her and by the time I came back several hours later (our girls were here with Matt) to ask that she not be assigned to him again it had already been handled. Everyone else here is fabulous and she was nasty to them as well as to us so I don't think anyone else took offense at my request.

40910,2018-03-11 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Becky I’m so sorry you had to have a night with a cranky nurse. Hopefully it was just something else she was dealing with in her own personal life and will do better with others going forward. We too suffered a day like that right after B was trached. I asked her to help him with a bed pan and she hit the panic button on the side of the bed to get him flat to roll. Fresh surgery and he plunked down and bounced the bed went so quickly. I was hot and fortunately the nurse from the ALS clinic had been visiting and witnessed “nurse Ratchet”. She helped me get B back off the pan and kept watch while I suctioned him so that we would not need her “services” again. Scary times to be sure. It’s those types of things that make you want to get them the heck out of dodge knowing you will do better even if you are slower and still learning.  I’m happy to hear you were able to get a night at the hotel and rest up some. You will need that for the coming weeks until Matt is completely comfortable on the vent.

We just can't explain our situation to anyone can we? If we try it sounds like we 'complaining' when we are 'explaining' and it can sound like we 'don't want to' when it's actually 'we don't want this to happen to our loved one'.  I'm so glad you now have DSIL and DBIL trained and your hubby saw that he survived it too. Can I suggest something - try to get them as involved as possible now.   What happens very often is that if people don't start helping and then keep helping suddenly our PALS is very progressed and people are scared as anything. If they 'keep their hand in' they find they are adjusting to the changes and it's not so scary.  I'm not sure how often they can be around but even just being there for visits and helping with little things here and there can make a big difference. It can also help reduce his anxiety as DH can feel more confident with their help.,False,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/well-that-didnt-go-as-planned.42645/page-2

43007,2018-11-05 00:00:00,Feeling lost,Hello all I’m new at this hopefully I’m getting it right lol. June of this year my father was diagnosed with ALS. I was in the room with him when he received the news. Those words haunt me “1-3years I recommend you go home and get your affairs in order”.  It started with a heavy feeling in his left arm and six months later..... no control of left arm left leg barely hanging in there right arm is starting to go can’t speak drooling choking constipated........  I am soo soo afraid. I’m not ready to lose my dad and not to the f*cked up disease. I’m angry! I’m scared. I’m worried. I’m drained. I’m tired. I’m frustrated. I have never felt more alone in all my life and the worst part is I feel so bad for complianing about how I feel. I look at him and see how badly he is struggling and I want to cry and scream and I can’t. I Feel like anyone I try to talk to about this just doesn’t get it.   I started seeing. Therapist ironically she has a family member also with ALS. She basically told me to stay off the internet stop looking for help it’s a terminal illness and I have to accept that. F*ck her! I want my dad comfortable.   I’m super emotional right now and starting to ramble.

42975,2018-11-01 00:00:00,It's been 3 years,This month marks 3 years since my husband was diagnosed. He is still progressing very slowly for which I am thankful. His left hand is completely gone his left arm is weak and he tells me his right grip is getting weaker. He can still walk talk and eat. My caregiving role is currently limited to helping him dress tying his shoes and cutting meat not to mention trying to keep his (and my) spirits up. That is a challenge with ALS as all of us know. We have been lucky enough to do a little traveling and have done some wonderful things together.  He is concerned that exercise may hasten his progression; it is a fine line between trying to get enjoyment out of life and not doing things that may be harmful. He is fatigued a lot and says exercise tends to wipe him out. He also has pinned a lot of hope on the Brainstorm trial; I'm cautious about it as so many things have been tried and failed.   I have so appreciated being on this forum for the support and help. In many cases you all have helped me sort out the best course of action as we go forward.

42968,2018-10-31 00:00:00,1 Month Warning...,1 Month Warning. That's what I just gave the family via the private family FB page. One month of no quality coherent time with Matt and we will be taking him off the vent.  He was clear headed about a week ago just long enough to tell me that crazy communication doesn't count so when he's not able to understand and interact I need to treat him as if there is no communication at all. He originally gave me 30 days to be sure so that's what I'm going to try to give myself now.  He thinks we are trying him up and torturing him. This is no good. It's cruel. He has fired the help several times and is very unhappy that I keep bringing them back. Today he described what he would do to his nurse if he came back in the room and it wasn't good. Well if he could move at all it wouldn't be good. He told the massage therapist today that he might have to divorce me because I keep him tied up. Wow. Just wow.   I had hoped to get past the holidays but I'm not going to put him through this that long. I've told everyone that in this state he won't understand what he's already demanded that I do so if they want to be here we will tell him it's a party and I'll do that same terrible thing he threatened to anyone who tells him differently. Actually I think they will all be supportive. They've seen what he's going through.  Now to get through the rest of this month.  When he's up he rages for hours and hours. 12 or 13 hours is not unusual. When he's not he sleeps for days. I now pray for the sleepy days and nights.  I can no longer think of any way to make his life better or even worth living. I fear we've run out of time. At the end of January it would be 5 years. I'd love another but not like this.  So do I put up the tree and turn it into a holiday party? Do I give him Christmas with his grandkids or will that mar Christmas for the family in the future? I will ask them but I'm hoping that doing it right will create wonderful memories and then allow them to have the holiday at at the normal time and perhaps just give him a toast.  Oh man I've done it. I've scheduled it...sort of. I'm still hoping we can make some medication adjustment and get some more good days and I'll call the Pallative Care doc tomorrow to discuss that but as a friend told me today restarting the clock because he has one good day out of 30 is not the answer. Wow. December. It's right around the corner.  Im in the middle of having the kitchen remodeled. It's the last big project he wanted to see done. Once it's finished I'll decorate and then bring him out. Somehow he's getting out of that bed and back into the living room/kitchen area where he can see his lake. Please God let it happen.  I think I'm in shock. Shot. Yes that's the answer...a shot of something strong. I think I need it.  Becky The Queen of Crazy  PS.

43794,2019-02-26 00:00:00,Won't go to the Hospital Bed!,"Hi Emily this may not be much help but can I suggest you get into the hospital bed yourself and see if there are any issues with its comfort? I say this because my mother complained bitterly about some discomfort in her hospital bed mattress...the nice ALS closet supplied us with a few different mattresses to try out and we finally found one that worked. I thought she was just being a little princess. Sadly she passed away last month and I actually climbed on the bed to rest while I was clearing out the apartment. I had a better idea of what she was experiencing stuck in that bed all the time. When the closet came to pick up the bed I saw that there was actually a bar at the point where it bends right under the butt area when you raise the head-end of the bed. With the mattress cells running side to side across the bed she'd actually wind up resting her butt on the bar as it protruded side to side between the cells. It was excruciating to her and I just sort of didn't understand it. If I had gotten in the bed when she started complaining I would have understood it better. She wasn't able to articulate ""why"" it was so uncomfortable. In hindsight if I had known I would have ordered a bed with solid base sections instead of the less expensive one which had a spring base.  I did get Hoyered a few times to see what that was like and I know it wasn't too smart but I tried the Bipap machine too for a couple of breaths (which was a shock)...but I think it might help to empathize a bit with our PALS by experiencing what they experience when it comes to comfort.

43794,2019-02-26 00:00:00,Won't go to the Hospital Bed!,We fed my husband in his wheelchair using a height-adjustable H table (also goes over a hospital bed) for the food. We gave up on suction but we did that in the wheelchair too. I would highly recommend an H table (which I am using as I type this for my laptop desk).   I certainly would start with the idea that he could sleep more comfortably/avoid spine damage/pressure injury risks that sleeping in the recliner raises the odds of so it's a health intervention not just a convention or comfort thing (assuming you try it and find that's true; yes I would literally sleep in it so you can find/eradicate any issues).   Beyond that most PALS are just as comfortable in a well-set up wheelchair during the day and that gets rid of the argument that using the bed is giving up.

43794,2019-02-27 00:00:00,Won't go to the Hospital Bed!,To me the advantages are the height - I will be able to stand to do personal care. I will be able to stand to do cough assist. I will be able to stand to take the Trilogy on and off. If we need to suction then I'm not trying to move around on my knees around the recliner to get it ready. We can change his clothes and pull up his pants in the bed. We can roll him over to prevent sores on bottom. Some of this can be done in the wheelchair as well but he's gotten to where he doesn't like to be in the chair. And the chair does not solve the problem of swallowing and holding his head.

43793,2019-02-25 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,I am sorry you are going through this.  I urge you not to underestimate how fatigued PALS can get and how valuable rest is in delaying progression.  I found that while I was still working I did nothing but work and sleep. Yet even with that I was not getting sufficient sleep and my progression was moving along at an alarming rate.  I stopped work shortly after diagnosis. I believe all I did for the first 3 or 4 months was sleep and talk to insurance folks. I was sleeping up to 20 hours a day.  The good news is that for me once I stopped working and started getting the rest my body was demanding progression seemed to slow down. I don't know if that would be the case for other PALS but it certainly was the case for me.  Now I simply get the sleep I need. It is not just sleep but it is conservation of effort that I believe has made a big difference. The more time I spend and bed and in my wheelchair (where I am properly supported) the better I feel.  I also think you are wise to consider the potential for depression contributing to what he is going through. Be aware that true depression is not overcome by willpower. It requires medical intervention. If you suspect depression is a contributing factor you need to work with your PALS to see appropriate medical folks.

Once I stopped working saw a psychiatrist and got adequate  restful  sleep and work out proper meds I was able to be present- before that it was all irritability and deep grinding fatigue all the way.

I'm trying to get him to pick a few things each week that he wants to do and then I work out the other stuff. So it's not me...I just want him to live.  As far as work goes he wants to work.

I don't doubt the exhaustion -- I know it is real. He also has a lot of trouble sleeping at night if he sleep to much during the day so it's a cycle too.   We are finding our way.

43793,2019-02-25 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,"Nikki - Thank you. He does want to work and his work is letting him work from home when possible. We spent most of Jan. doing all our finances and estate planning stuff so we have a sense of the budget.   I think he's finding a balance of quality of life and working. His favorite thing to do is watch our boys play their various sports so as long as he has energy to do that I think he is okay working too. He gets a lot of satisfaction and purpose from his job.   What I'm noticing is that he needs to plan and ""save up"" his energy to do the things he wants to do. Or he needs a lot of recovery time after he does something. I think we both have had trouble with trying to maintain a normal-functioning home for our kids but also making sure he get the rest he needs.   He feels guilty resting so much. It's just hard to know what is the right thing to do because we are constantly reacting. For example he insists that he can go to MGH from Rhode Island on the train by himself for a clinic visit. I insist that I should drive him so he can sleep up and back and he gets mad because he doesn't want me missing work. And he won't let anyone else take him. But I know that the clinic visit just by itself is too much for him to do alone.   I love him but geesh this is not easy to navigate.

43793,2019-02-25 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,Nikki -- thank you for saying that. I think he mostly agrees  .   Good point about saving energy for MGH -- I will suggest that he thinks about extra rest before and after his visits.  He is also planning a solo trip with our 12 yo to Spring Training at the end of March. I'm happy he's doing it but so worried about how taxing it will be for him. The trip is an important one as he wants to do it now while he can with our son. But I'm concerned it's going to be too hard for him and he is going to feel like crap if it is...  We tried to find someone to go with them but no one can swing it right now. All I do is worry and then try to figure out how to intervene without being a nag or making him feel like he can't do anything.

43793,2019-02-25 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,Ditto to everything noted above.  Energy conservation is key. Ways to conserve energy include the obvious getting enough sleep. But other ways that might not be obvious to someone recently diagnosed include:  1. Early use of BiPAP. He is probably getting PFTs and the clinic will advise on when to start BiPAP. But getting started earlier rather than later if possible can save a lot of energy.  2. Early use of assistive devices for walking. Cane -&gt; walker -&gt; wheelchair. Think of them not only in terms of enhancing mobility and preventing falls but also in terms of energy conservation.  3. Help with dressing and bathing if hands are compromised.  4. Maintaining adequate hydration and caloric input. If chewing is tiring then time for a mechanical soft diet with lots of blended foods. If swallowing is difficult then a feeding tube. Weight loss burns more muscle speeds progression and drains energy.  Definitely consider depression as a contributing factor to fatigue and poor sleep.  And if he absolutely loves his job is there a way to do it part time?,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/sleeping-all-the-time-early-stages.43793/

42887,2018-10-20 00:00:00,Texas/condom catheter - help!,Hi Tammy   We had the same problem with the condom catheter bag not draining and I sensed it was a vacuum problem but didn't take the time to google for ideas. I just did and here's one idea I found.  Urine is not draining into the leg bag or urine collection device. Solution: Regularly empty the leg bag or collection device always leaving a small amount of urine in the bag to avoid creating a vacuum. When a vacuum is created it prevents urine from draining into the bag or collection unit.  I also read some people suggest blowing air into the bag before using it. It seems a lot people have had this problem and they seem to think it's a vacuum and/or malfunctioning valve problem.  We ended up using this product which worked well for us.,True,KateEmerson,2016-04-23 00:00:00,514,Lost a loved one,2013-09-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Boston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/texas-condom-catheter-help.42887/

42887,2018-10-21 00:00:00,Texas/condom catheter - help!,Thanks everyone.  I had already tried to leave some urine and I still had the same problem. Blowing into the bag isn't very appealing. We get two bags a month so they are reused.  The Advantage wouldn't work for us since he doesn't have much use of his hands left so he would have to wake me to use it. But thanks anyway.  Holding the tube up doesn't help. Unless I release the vacuum by disconnecting the catheter if doesn't drain.  It isn't a problem to have some urine in the tip of the catheter. The problem is when he tilts back. Since there is urine in the extension tube it pours into the catheter. Then when he tilts back again it stays in the catheter soaking him in urine. If this doesn't possibly cause a UTI then it doesn't matter. I'm just worried that this isn't a good for him. He already is resistant to one antibiotic used for UTI.

My husband never really was comfortable in his WC and preferred his lift recliner and it worked well with that so reclining the upper body shouldn't affect it. The degree of tilt in the seat may. We taped a piece of wedge shaped foam to the underside of the urinal to get it to drain away from him when the seat was tilted back.  I'm not sure I'm clear on the clothing question.

I think your therapist may have meant to stay off searching for miracle cures on the internet. I'm not sure check with her on that so you know her meaning as that's important. This often happens - people are so shocked they feel there 'must be something' and let me tell you there are a lot of scammers out there boasting of cures and they will happily empty every one of your bank accounts to give you their snake oil.

43007,2018-11-05 00:00:00,Feeling lost,I'm sorry to hear about your dad. It sounds like his progression may be fairly rapid and so I would especially make sure you are staying ahead of the game in terms of equipment. Let us know if you need help.   Tillie is right -- I'm sure the therapist did not mean to avoid finding out ways to keep your dad comfortable for as long as possible. You can and should keep up with the options and that will help you feel more in control as well. There are definitely things you can buy/kludge/do for him that will help him feel better.  Cry and scream all you want -- in the shower or car. You don't have to be super-strong all the time. You just need to stay you for him and you both.  Often your city may have a [ALS and/or other serious/terminal illnesses] caregiver group or nationally there are teleconference/Webinar options where you can talk with your peers.

If you haven’t reached out do find your nearest ALS chapter. The help and resources are invaluable. If your dad is a vet get the VA on board and since you live in CA start to get info on what your county offers in the way of assistance. You didn’t give your dad’s age but if he is a senior there are programs in place. A social worker will be required to visit.

42975,2018-11-08 00:00:00,It's been 3 years,Jen this is how it speeds progression. Resistance exercise causes micro tears in the muscles. The repair of these micro tears causes an influx of muscle tissue and so the muscle mass increases with each repair. This is how we normally build muscles up.  A PALS does not have that same response and micro tears do not heal or heal poorly and the muscle can in fact waste faster as a result.

Yes his vent settings have been evaluated and adjusted regularly and I've been assured that we've done everything we can. Between the vent and the cough assist and the IPV we are blowing off any co2 that can be blown off and his lungs are kept clear. The VA has had his meds evaluated regularly by the pharmacist and we knew months ago that we had entered the stage where his comfort would come at the cost of his clarity.   What is happening now is that confusion and hallucinations welcoming a new component: mean behavior. He has told me to move out several times told his massage therapist that he might have to divorce me because I keep him tied up and this morning he asked his daughter which house she wants. He keeps asking for a gun and threatening to use it (he can't move his hands for heaven's sake).   I love the idea of the slide show and pre-departure celebration of life. Maybe I can wrap our minds around making it a month long celebration instead of a month of mourning and counting down the days. So far the family has all been very supportive--we'll see if my announcement brings anything other out of the woodworks. I'm not worried about being able to handle it but I sure hope it doesn't happen.   This morning he is on a rage. Everyone is mistreating him. We have myself a nurse an aide and his daughter and he's off the hook. I've just been summoned again so I'm trying to gear myself up to go back in. He's run everyone else out.,True,Nuts,2014-02-23 00:00:00,2576,Lost a loved one,2014-01-01 00:00:00,US,NC,Littleton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/1-month-warning.42968/

43793,2019-02-25 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,In re sleep and progression ALS burns energy at an abnormal rate. Sleep during which metabolic demands are low helps restore that.  There are also known relationships among depression anxiety pain and sleep -- if one is out of whack the others often are as well. You literally feel pain more when you are tired and it is harder to maintain mood as well.  And of course being diagnosed with ALS and starting to deal with that reality whether with legalities work changes going to clinic what have you saps energy in its own right.   He can have a balance with working as long as he can after which his focus will have to shift. So if he wants to work watch the boys and sleep more than anything else right now I say let it be. And if continuing to work speeds up his progression that is his choice as well because he knows the tradeoffs as well as any of us.   Is there a plan for the boys' school when he has to leave work? If not he may be worried about that? So if it can be worked out maybe that would ease his mind.

39014,2017-07-03 00:00:00,Struggling,Sometimes I even hate to do a rant like this because I feel like I'm whining. It's taken me 24 hours to get up the courage to put pen to paper as it were.   Yes I'm struggling. The why has multiple reasons. These are on no particular order.   1) sleep. Hasn't been going well. Mostly due to the fact that I still sleep in the same room with Brian and he goes thru times when his machines especially the vent seem extra noisy even with earplugs to try and mute it a bit. I know lack of that just makes everything else seem all the more intense  2) April. Our little episode has really done a number on me. The kids too esp DD which makes it even worse on me.   3) Brian being or having become what seems like a spoiled brat. I don't want anyone to take this the wrong way. We all agree that our PALS should be given as much control of their own lives/decisions as possible. However I think that sometimes there can be a detrimental side of that as well. Sometimes they get so used to being catered to that they forget that there is a human that many times is at the other end of that request is struggling just to make it through the next hour.   We all acknowledge in many cases such as mine their PALS can do nothing at all for themselves and if it were not for a speech device they would basically be considered locked in. We know that we are all they have and it pains our hearts greatly. However many times we feel as though we've become nothing more than a maid to deal with all their becks and calls and get no more respect than the ant crawling across a floor unwanted  I know I'm becoming burnt to a crisp. On wed i will be getting in touch with the therapist that DD has been going to I know I need it. The trick will be finding a time that I can actually get there. I've been on meds in the past and had to get off of them they were making me feel worse and I had a very difficult time coming off of them so I'm not sure about that aspect.  I know I need help finding a way to get that help is what is really causing issues. I definitely cannot afford to pay someone. If I can get the ACT 150 to pan out at all I will than have to find someone on my own as it will only cover attendant care and since Brian is on a vent that means no agency will send someone in. That's my next difficult hurtle.   I've looked into a home I cannot afford that and his disability all on it's own is just above the line needed for Medicaid to ever kick in no matter how much money we would spend down not that there is a lot of that either. If there was I'd be using it to hire someone.   I feel so stuck so alone so burnt out and no where to turn. Not to mention trying to keep a somewhat happy face on for my DD so she will carry forward with her life.  Add to all the above my back is still giving me issues. Yes I use the lift but the lift doesn't work for washing his back. For that I have to push him onto his side and then hold him there with one hand while washing with the other it's quite the elaborate 2 handed ballet. Not to mention he's 6'2 his limbs are completely floppy but turning him is like doing a one handed tire flip. So then I take some ibu to calm the back but that attacks my colon and makes me more weepy   I'm just so frustrated and have no where to turn  Ok rant over.

We ended up being denied any home health care nursing or otherwise they said it wasn't 'medically necessary'. What a joke. I am pursuing some part time help out of pocket I need to stay strong for him. Went to the clinic at the end of last month. It may be our last visit. We were there most of the day and my husband was so exhausted he cut it short himself without seeing the final appointment and I brought him home. Getting tired always makes him progress and he doesn't recover to what he was before we went. I know this disease doesn't have a linear progression and he is declining again. He doesn't want to go back to the clinic. He says he feels so much better not thinking he has to go back there. He is using the trilogy intermittently during the day now plus cough assist suctioning nebulizer...etc. He is still eating by mouth fine. He asked to bring hospice in. I don't know where this will take us but since they have started my husband is so relieved and his blood pressure is within normal range again which it hasn't been since he was diagnosed.

43198,2018-12-07 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,"Thomas933  I'm sorry to have to welcome you here but glad that you found us nonetheless. One thing I can say with certainty is that the knowledge that can be gained here will help volumes with the uncertainty that ALS brings into our lives.  My PALS my wife Darcey first noticed something was wrong in Nov 2012. We were trying to walk 4 blocks to a restaurant and she was finding that walk to be extremely difficult. Later that evening she went into a public restroom and found that she was unable to get up on her own. We then knew something was wrong... but didn't know what that might be.  The next several months were filled with doctor appointments. Each was unable to pinpoint a source cause and referred to the next for more testing. Eventually Darcey made it to the neurologist and was diagnosed with CIDP. CIDP is treatable and can be recoverable. So for the better part of a year we put life on hold as we ""waited to get better"". But Darcey's ability to walk to use her hands to drive to get up steps... all things continued to decline and get more difficult. In the spring of 2014 Darcey was accepted for evaluation by Johns Hopkins and was ultimately diagnosed with ALS.  By this time Darcey was no longer driving was spending much of her time in a power wheel chair and needed help transferring from her PWC to do toileting or to get into or out of her bed. While ALS was not the diagnosis we'd hoped for we at least then knew what we were dealing with. We knew that ALS was terminal. We knew that she was going to continue to lose the ability to do things as time continued to pass. We knew there was no getting off of this train so we began to seek to make what was left of that life as good as we could make it. Life which had been on hold was rejoined. We began to again do the things we enjoyed doing... adapting along the way as ALS required.  As time continued Darcey began to lose use of her arms and hands. In March of 2015 Darcey's then neurologist suggested that he believed that she was within 6 months of life's end. Much of that analysis was based upon her breathing history. Our 28 year old son was with us on that appointment. I can still see the smile on Darcey's face as she looked at us and then back to the doctor. She then said ""Thank you for the advance notice... but I've still got things to do... WE'VE STILL GOT THINGS TO DO. So if it is all the same to you we're just going to keep moving forward and will continue to make adjustments if and when they become necessary."" We no longer participated in the ALS Clinic after that day and did not again see that neurologist (instead picking one closer to us). He was however the very best of all of the specialists that we had the privilege of working with. Our ONLY complaint was that he was nearly an hour away from our home.   So... to the point of this long reply...   2015 came and passed... as did 2016... and 2017. We are now about to complete 2018 and I expect that Darcey will participate in another Christmas and New Years celebration with us. Perhaps she is still around because she chose to live the time that was left rather than to simply hang around waiting to die. Regardless even the experts can't tell anyone with any real certainty the exact timeline of what tomorrow will bring.  I don't know what will work for you and your PALS but I do know what has worked for us...  Forget about trying to put a mark on the calendar for life's end. It is not worthy of your time or attention. Instead treat each day as another gift and seek to make the very best of it and to do those things that you can do today... as you may not be able to do them tomorrow. And for those things that can no longer be done find other things that can be done. Even with a diagnosis of ALS there is much that can yet be done and accomplished. And most importantly be patient with each other and talk openly about how each of you feel. No one is going to quite understand the road you will travel as well as the two of you.

43198,2018-12-07 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,Forget about trying to put a mark on the calendar for life's end. It is not worthy of your time or attention. Instead treat each day as another gift and seek to make the very best of it and to do those things that you can do today... as you may not be able to do them tomorrow. And for those things that can no longer be done find other things that can be done. Even with a diagnosis of ALS there is much that can yet be done and accomplished. And most importantly be patient with each other and talk openly about how each of you feel. No one is going to quite understand the road you will travel as well as the two of you.   Jim that's gold. Thanks for that...helps me too.  6 months ago my neurologist told us: your mother should go into long term care. We ignored him on that point. She's moving into my apartment building in a week.

43198,2018-12-07 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,Thomas933  I feel for you and your family. We've all been through the shock grief and fear that comes with the initial news that our loved one has ALS. In our case the diagnosis seemed so quick - my husband noticed wasting of his hand in July and was diagnosed at the end of October/beginning of November 2015. I completely fell apart and could not function; I cried every day for the first six months. I ended up taking a low dose of an antidepressant which helps me to maintain my sanity and not break down every day.   The first neurologist was an arrogant jerk so I worked hard on changing my PALS' coverage and got him in to see the best MND specialist in our area. The MND specialist makes me feel better is very kind and also is in tune with the various clinical trials out there. While my PALS isn't a good candidate for most of the trials (his progression is slow) it still gives us hope. This forum has also helped me; I am inspired by both the CALS and PALS here.   I've just read JimINVA's post - I'm always touched by the love he shows Darcey. I hope we can all treat each day as a gift as Jim says. I'm thankful for my PALS for being patient and kind to me.   Everyone on the forum has been understanding and helpful as well. Stay in touch and you'll find a lot of support here.

42436,2018-09-11 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,"You are right Tillie. There is a range of collective answers about lifts and I agree with your assessment.   We are fortunate that I am 6' 3"" at 225 lbs and my wife weighs only 155 lbs.   I could lift her without the lift (not recommended) so the electric lift did not give the advantage for us as it might for others.  Several things about the lift were frustrating for us:  Failure of the lift mid-way while lifting from chair to bed. No recourse but to pick her up manually. Scary!  Battery charging. We did not use the lift frequently so there were times we forgot to set the charger. Sometimes the power cable did not seat well. On advice from this forum we performed a ""jiggle"" maneuver on the cable to get it to work.  Small circumference wheels on the electric lift forced us to pull the lift rather than push it on carpet. The larger wheels on the manual lift made rolling across carpet much easier.  The electric would not fit in our van. The manual lift does.  These points are for information and not a rant against electric lifts. The electrics have a definite advantages for lifting when a manual lift takes too much effort.

42436,2018-09-11 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,"You're right Ernie - there is on ""one size fits all"" solution (for anything ALS related).  Another thing to consider is what type of sling to use. We have 2. A split leg to go to and from bed. And a Liko HygieneVest HighBack (Model 55) to go from PWC to toilet and back. The Liko has been great because it allows me to keep him more upright to position him on the toilet but I like the more traditional one to get him to a reclined position.

42436,2018-09-12 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,We have three slings.   Ended up using the mesh sling exclusively. Is more comfortable for her.  My PALS is bed bound so we use the lift infrequently.   No trips to the bathroom and only occasionally trips to her sleeper/lift chair.   We do transport her to doctor's appointments which requires the lift but only for emergent care.

43079,2018-11-17 00:00:00,Is this depression or something else,In fairness Greg FVC does not always correlate with BiPAP hours/day needed as FVC is not always the best measure of respiratory function in PALS and pre-existing conditions body type etc. influence how the body adjusts to reduced air flow.   Also the BiPAP settings themselves can be adjusted to work with the musculature that exists or not...so Roger in addition to how many Trilogy hours your PALS is clocking looking at the settings which require at least occasional adjustment would be another thought.

39014,2017-07-03 00:00:00,Struggling,Thank you girls.   We have one son and one daughter. In Aug our son is changing jobs specifically so he will have more time to help us when our DD goes off to grad school. Currently he running our metal fab shop. It's gone through a few rough years as many small manufacturers have been thru. He currently works 10-12 hours a day. His wife will be going back to grad school as well and he will be taking her job as all three have the same under grad degree. That will open up more time for him to help me here. However it complicates work as I will be dealing with a new GM at the shop and that always causes issues with the rest of the employees.   Sleep wise we have tried leaving his communication device in front of him but if he coughs his one and only thumb that can move a bit involuntarily moves which wakes the device and it makes quite a sound when it wakes and wakes us both up. Other than that he cannot alert me. Generally it's me hearing a change in his breathing that wakes me. That makes it difficult to move out of the room. I've thought about a baby monitor but not sure how that would work if it would allow me to turn it down enough to calm the noise that's keeping me awake while still allowing me to hear the changes.   I will see if anyone has a baby monitor I could borrow so I could give it a try.   Thank you for the suggestions and hugs. They mean the world to me.

39014,2017-07-04 00:00:00,Struggling,"Sue I really get it and I am sending you virtual hugs.  I find the lack of sleep really makes everything seem overwhelming. Frank wanted me to sleep in the same room and I tried that initially but I just couldn't handle the demands of each day with so little sleep. I am a very light sleeper and his frequent loud snoring coughing and the noise of the Trilogy kept me up most of the night. I now sleep in another bedroom with a baby monitor on the lowest setting which i place in the bedroom closet with the door almost shut. I have been able to hear when he calls me or any machine alarms go off.   I am dealing with the lack of help as well. Do you have any church affiliation that you could contact to request some volunteer help? When both of my parents died last year who lived in NY I found out that the most ""wonderful caring best caregiver in the world"" (or so we thought) who had been taking care of them in their home for 24 hours a day for 4 years was stealing things and making online purchases for herself using my mother's credit card (over $30000 in 2016 alone). Everybody was completely fooled by this woman. Their neighbors and their priest who made frequent home visits constantly told me how lucky my parents were to have this woman take care of them. Now I completely distrust everyone and I am very afraid to have a stranger come in to my house to help care for Frank so I have been doing it all by myself.  The lack of empathy that my husband expresses toward me hurts the most. This is so unlike the way he used to be. I tell myself it's not him-- it's the ALS but it still hurts.  Jrzygrl I am also dealing with a husband who is fighting the use of the hoyer lift.

43180,2018-12-04 00:00:00,Slipping Away,Twinkle I am so very sorry to hear your husbands current situation. However I beg you to be brutally honest with your kids. They are adults. They will not like what they will hear but I’m afraid they could be bitter later if you didn’t tell them and they missed opportunities with there Dad.  My husband just passed on Friday at 56 our kids are 31 (his wife 29) and our daughter 24. While I tried to keep things light for our DD who is in PT school I was honest and I did get her home here before the inevitable.   That said Brian had many close calls over the years. But still I was honest.  Hugs,True,Narrowminded,2016-04-30 00:00:00,2740,Lost a loved one,2007-07-01 00:00:00,US,PA,Pittsburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/slipping-away.43180/
41221,2018-06-26 00:00:00,Drained,Hi Annie Good luck with the aide- I hope your husband likes him/her and it works out well for you. I have a morning a week and it’s a godsend. I have the same dilemma of whether to spend it on errands or me time. At the very least I try to alternate so I have a super busy morning getting as much done as possible one week and then take some time for myself the next week to meet a friend for breakfast or go to a yoga class or collapse in a heap or something. I hope you figure out a way to manage it so you get a little down time for yourself.  My husband also has refused the stomach tube/PEG so far. It doesn’t seem to be a very popular decision amongst PALS. I totally respect his wishes on that and I think I would feel the same though I am a little nervous how it will affect him down the track...time will tell.

41221,2018-07-03 00:00:00,Drained,One of my daughters asked me today if the disease is affecting my PALS thinking She has observed that he is not only different physically but mentally. His cognitive skills are ok but when it comes to family situations sometimes he loses his patience and/or makes observations that aren't accurate. I can't imagine how he must feel every day fighting this disease. But now I find myself second guessing whether it is him or the disease speaking Does that make any sense? It is hard to put into words. (He can stil speak although we have observed that others need him to repeat what he says or we translate). My daughter thinks that I need to push back when he wants me to do something that seems unnecessary instead of just going along because he is ill. I thought because he has a lot of time on his hands he notices a lot of projects around the house that he can't do himself but wants me to take care of but now I wonder.,True,ARCG,2016-10-12 00:00:00,204,Lost a loved one,2015-01-01 00:00:00,US,TX,Houston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/drained.41221/page-3
41221,2018-07-08 00:00:00,Drained,I was just reading on this myself. About half of all patients with ALS have cognitive changes according to recent studies:   The ALS Association   I see this same thing with my Mom (CALS) and Dad (PALS). I don't think he realizes it happens but when he has a thought it's her body that has to execute that thought. So she ends up trying to live out two peoples lives in one body. Part of the cognitive changes that can happen is to not be able to empathize with the other person.,True,ThisPresentMoment,2018-05-30 00:00:00,123,Lost a loved one,2017-12-01 00:00:00,US,MN,Minneapolis,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/drained.41221/page-3
41221,2018-07-10 00:00:00,Drained,Thanks interesting article. His cognitive skills are still intact so I hope those aren't affected going forward.  Since he has made the decision to let nature take its course and not to have invasive measures he is much calmer. He says he knows what is right for him and feels happy with his decision. His blood pressure has been through the roof since he was diagnosed four years ago and now that he no longer goes to the clinic it is back to normal. I have been very stressed (more than normal) but think I am starting to adjust to this new phase now that I see this is what he wants. I am so scared of losing him but my priest says don't jump to the end and try to live in today. What a horrible disease this is and what a brave man he is.   I have an aide coming every Thursday for a few hours and he really likes her which is a relief.

You can’t cry nonstop when you have kids to care for.  We went on a lot of family trips we got our finances in order we renovated where we needed to. Our kids still don’t know the extent because they are too young to understand but they’ve seen the progression from cane to walker to wheelchair. They are resilient. We will share more when we need to but for now they are fine with what we’ve told them.  You can do this. It’s hard. It’s overwhelming. It’s exhausting.

I took an antidepressant and to be honest that is what stopped me feel like I was just constantly screaming inside.  What you feel is completely valid. This sucks totally - the loss of so much! We are losing the person we love most and so many things about the life we had. It will not ever be the same that's a fact and hard to swallow.  Please try to just focus on little bits not the entire picture and I strongly suggest you consider a counsellor that you can trust and talk to your doctor about meds if you feel you would be comfortable taking something. I am not the least bit ashamed to say that I took medications it's not a failing. Some people don't like to take any and that is fine too. Just offering options and how different things helped me.

Poor mom is generally a great patient problem is she has lost all movement apart from her right hand. I have only a pathologist to watch her general situation and a ENT to follow how she eats. I call her neurologist in the hospital to update him for her situation and the one who is in out city is a general one who seems scared of the whole situation. When i brought him home the first time to chek on her he left the house asap as he finished the examination. We have a foam matress but she is resisiting it. She is stubborn like that wants things to happen on her own way. She doesnt sleep at night apart from the first 3 hours she continues to go to bed at 12 at night just like when she was healthy. I asked her doc if we could give her something to sleep at night but he said its going to make her even heavier during the day. We are still considering it. We are exhausted all 3 of us. The other day she apologised to me i said hey mum no why apologise? No. She said you go to work and then you come here and i also keep u up. She can barely talk now. She is so beautiful. With a fantastic skin you know. And amazing eyes. Up till this came up she had no health issues. Looking at us with those big eyes. I got my own fear of being sick too and all that heavys on me so much.

41796,2018-06-27 00:00:00,NinaP's Mother,"Stubborness is one way for your mom of staying in control. Even if it doesn't benefit her. In some small instances you might consider a simple ""trick"" to get her to do stuff that will help her and still be in charge. Present options to her so she can chose. Instead of ""Would you like a drink?"" you can ask ""Would you like to drink water coffee or juice?"".   If she is completely opposed to it she can always say so. Sneaking her something to help her sleep is pretty unethical. I totally understand that you need the sleep. Better talk to her and tell her that you NEED the rest or you will break down. If she already apologized to you she will understand. And then you can search for solutions together. She's more likely to make a compromise if it's her idea of helping you. Hope that makes sense.

42436,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,Thanks everyone!  A battery operated lift was delivered from the loan closet. It comes with an extra battery so at least I have that on hand. A PT showed me how to use it so I'm comfortable. with it  I got a U sling from the loan closet as well. I'm having a problem getting it on him without hurting my back. I fold it and stuff it under him and roll him to his side on the other side of the bed and pull it through. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. When the OT is comes hopefully she can tell me if I'm doing something wrong. Otherwise it's just my bad back.  I was looking into the Liko 55 sling. It's good to see that it works since it's so expensive. Maybe we can use a commode with that sling. We had a carpenter who's done work for PALS come to see if we can do something about our downstairs bathroom. There is nothing we can do unless we spend a large amount of money which DH doesn't want us to do.

But if your bathroom doesn't permit using a chair above the toilet or transferring to a shower/commode chair is too much many of us made do with commodes (buckets)in other rooms.

I tried to roll him this morning the get the sling on and it was nearly impossible (hurt my shoulder) so I know I'm doing the wrong thing.  I'm still having a problem with dressing. I put his shirt on in the PWC so that's fine. The OT showed me how to use a draw sheet in bed but I'm doing a lousy job. I'm hurting my back once again. I manage to get his pants on but I don't know how the OT did it so easily when she showed me. She's coming again soon so I'll have her show me again. I studied engineering so you would think I could figure this out. I'm very frustrated,True,TammyS,2018-08-15 00:00:00,20,CALS,2017-02-01 00:00:00,US,CT,suburb,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/page-2
42436,2018-10-03 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,If she is a good OT she will slowly show you several times.  Here is a tip - ask her if you can video her doing it.  I did this with a few things I was taught and it was invaluable to be able to watch it back a few times particularly for the really little details. Sometimes I would also take a little series of photos but video is wonderful. You can watch it as many times as you feel you need.  I also did video of some stuff that the home care staff here could follow along to learn to do things for Chris and they found that really helpful.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/page-2
42436,2018-10-11 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,If he is in a hospital bed try raising the whole bed before you put on or remove the sling. I have found this helps protect my back since I don't have to bend over so far to get the sling in place.,True,kitkat,2015-11-09 00:00:00,21,Lost a loved one,2015-11-01 00:00:00,US,MN,Fairmont,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/page-2
42436,2018-10-11 00:00:00,Hoyer/lift,That too and if the bed has a tilt mode use that just like you use tilt/recline in the wheelchair for the sling/transfers.  If two people are around you can use a SlidEase or other slip sheet under the bottom sheet then pop the corners in the morning and pivot him 90 degrees so when you sit him up you can move the Hoyer under the bed perpendicularly and it's easier to put on the sling that way too. Of course that only works if you have space on all four sides of the bed which is always a good idea to set up when you are arranging the room. You can still have an adjacent bed just a couple of inches away.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hoyer-lift.42436/page-2

43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,It really depends on where he is clinically and what his goals may be. 4 days in icu is tough and is not how it would be done here do you have a doctor or nurse who has evaluated him recently and knows ALS that you trust?  If it is pure comfort and the end is near he can be medicated and even receive oxygen if that is what is needed to pass peacefully.   But if you are further out and he wants to and the doctor and nurse think it can buy him time he wants that is different.   There is also another path though. I thought this was sudden? If he went from normal sats to 80 overnight then there may be something to treat that could put him back close to where he was yesterday. Ask if this scenario fits what the clinicians see,True,Nikki J,2012-03-22 00:00:00,11246,PALS,2014-04-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Boston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/02-or-no-02.43109/
43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,RT is coming out soon and I will ask. He also just (this past hour) is showing a weird reddish spotty (not bumps) rash on his face only. No fever.  I just asked him again (for the dozen+ time) about biPap and although he isn't vocal today (eyes mostly closed) but I made it visually explicit for his answer he just said he is now wanting biPap. I'm shocked. I will make the calls. The 3-4 ICU stay will be interesting and likely brutal.  I asked him if he wants to just be comfortable and the O2 on its own may speed up the end for him...or try bipap and see if he feels better/do you want to continue and fight and he wants to live/prolong things.

43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,I would push back on this ICU intro -- not needed an invitation for a hospital-acquired infection etc. esp. since he sounds frail. Phrase it with risk management home intro costs the government less etc.   BiPAP would help him use what he has rest the muscles etc. and if needed you could perhaps pay for extra RT visits. If he is decompensating it may be too late for BiPAP to do too much but it is hard to know that from afar. Supporting even shallow breathing can be very helpful. If he wants to go on I would try to support that wish on his terms.  Agree if sats dropped suddenly and a lot if nothing else would put on BiPAP and see what happens with the sats.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/02-or-no-02.43109/

39014,2017-07-04 00:00:00,Struggling,I could not have coped had we not started sleeping in separate rooms. I used a baby monitor and I set alarms to get up and check on Chris as well. Simply put you just have to sleep you just have to. I know he needs you through the night I know it is critical but if you don't solve these issues of stretching yourself too thin you are going to snap.  If you snap then someone is going to have to look after him and guess what it's not going to be one someone it is going to be multiple someones because no one other person can possibly do all you are doing.  I like the idea of contacting a local church that advertises good works - see is you can get someone to start helping with basic things like housework meal prep and maybe someone would so some fund raising to help you get someone to help. I don't know but girl you are nearly at breaking point and you know it.  But to start with I think you need to get into a separate room and try getting some sleep - I know it is scary.

39014,2017-07-04 00:00:00,Struggling,Jim - Thank you  Sharon - I get it about strangers. I remember you posting about issues you uncovered after your folks passed. I'm happy to know tha baby monitor works. Actually I was sitting in the next room we use as an office and noticing how much I could still hear the vent even with the TV going in our bedroom. We have a First floor master so not sure if I should reconfigure and move into the office room and put the office stuff i. The bedroom or try moving upstairs to sleep.   Yes the lack of empathy really does a number on you emotionally. As to the hoyer we just went thru that and I flat out told him i am not moving you up in the bed in our case without it either we use it or you stay down in the bed. Since Brian has no movement he had a choice use it or stay put he used it. I'd tell Frank the same thing. Then it's not caring or not about you. It's a choice for him to stay where he is or use it to move end of story.   Gooseberry - it's true trying to function on little sleep just doesn't cut it. I was on Celexa for 3 years. Started it after shingles the first time. That's when Brian decided we needed to move we were into the vent 2+ years at the time. I got to the point I could not stand to be on them any longer. Had a rough go getting off of them. Been off 2 years now and not sure I want to go there again but I may need to. Something different though.

39014,2017-07-04 00:00:00,Struggling,I think there are alot of different things to try besides Celexa. I am taking Zoloft which I know is popular among CALS. It helps a bunch. I still have problems though. I could stay in bed all day and be fine with it. My dr started me on Busbar (?sp). I called them yesterday and told them I saw no difference. They have upped the dose. Gonna try that for a week or two.  I say where ever you move. The office upstairs or where ever is sure to help...   I also think talking to a therapist will be a step in the right direction.   I too only feel like a caregiver. My PALS talks to people via text and encourages people via fb everyday. I feel like there is hardly no communication here... Just me sitting here alone taking care of everything including the dog he wanted.  I gave hopes of us CALS all getting together someday in person. Someplace nice... A beach maybe?!

It's sad but I'm at the point that I'm almost not even worried if there is an issue and that is definitely not good.   We do have a church we belong to and we do get meals occasionally but it happens for a short time and then disappears again. The hard part is I struggle with both gluten and dairy. You mention that and suddenly people forget how to cook. Never mind the chicken potato and veg they had for dinner fits the bill they can't see that. It's a small church so help is limited.   DD is doing better. She is going forward with school and her therapist is helping. She also suggested she get to the PCP and get on a med herself. She was to the Dr yesterday and started the med today. In a month she should really start noticing a difference. That will be good because her classes start at the end of Aug.   You are right I am at the breaking point but I wonder if some of that is the added stress of DD and the mood she has been in. It's very stressful when she's home.

Yeah why is it our PALS can encourage others but just even saying thank you to us is like it's going to kill them. I even had Brian out right tell me he's. PT going to say thank you for every little thing which means he never says it. He wouldn't say please either but I programmed it into the quick messages so it will say sit up please etc. then it bugs me because I had to add it myself or it wouldn't be there  I hope the additional med starts helping.

If those are her choices ( and they are mine btw so I obviously think they are good ones) encourage everyone to do them sooner rather than waiting.   I believe they are both comfort measures AND they can make your life as a CALS easier.   The feeding tube is very easy to take care of and doing tube feeds is much less work than feeding someone doubly so if they have swallowing difficulty.

I did my regularly scheduled check in with my truly fabulous Orthopedist (I have carpel and a questionable knee from birth) in March. He asked me what Brian’s first symptoms were and some other questions about ALS. I know from experience he HAD to have been at least a few patients first or second stop on the way to an ALS Dx. Yet you could see he an MD of 35 years practice knew little on it and was sort of horrified by it besides.   I compared this to a few years ago when I told him an uncle had a brain tumor (not CA but in a dangerous location). He chatted on about all they could do now where to find the best people etc. My uncle is fine btw. Ten hours and two surgeons but just fine.

41449,2018-05-13 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Lenore huge hugs to you.   As for a clueless story it would be my SIL Brian’s sister. Her comment was while her father was dying from cancer. He went tfrom being lively with family while in the hospital to gone in 36 hours. While sitting at his bedside while he was calm relaxed and in a coma she said something about emotional and I said something about watching my husband die in front of me for 12 years her reply but not like this? While no one wants to lose their parent 36 hours was rather a Walk in the park. Of course no death can be compared and none are easy. The idea behind her comment was basically it wasn’t bad emotionally to watch your husband die a little more each day for 12 years. She basically discounted all we have been through.   I was fortunate to be able to be at my FIL’s bedside and be able to FaceTime so DH could see his Dad one last time. That was so hard. Then at the funeral I had to read a statement from Brian about his Dad and their relationship. That was excruciating. Brian had to attend the funeral via video. All the while my SIL could not wrap her mind around that being tough emotionally   I agree you need a video to show your new boss exactly what ALS involves. The people doing the ice bucket challenge were a huge help but extremely removed from the reality of what ALS really is. He needs live pics.

41449,2018-05-17 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Lenore We got the kit too at the beginning of hospice. There was a pill in there that said it was for hallucinations. We both looked at it and wondered why he would need it. What I didn't realize was that at the end of life extreme agitation and hallucinations are common. By the time he got to that stage the pill had been forgotten about and hospice never mentioned it again not even when they left us that night before he passed. He died early on a Tuesday morning. Sunday night the last night he was awake was AWFUL! He couldn't get comfortable and was very agitated. For 3 hours I had to keep moving him to try to get him comfortable (which never happened until he finally feel asleep and didn't wake up). Now I know that he should have had that particular pill that night. I was very grateful for the morphine towards the end but wish I (and hospice) had remembered that pill.

I would call hospice but I know the knowledge on this forum is better and I don’t want her to overhear a telephone conversation with hospice.  Also she has rejected the Trilogy twice today.

43256,2018-12-16 00:00:00,Resources for relatives living abroad,Hello  I was not sure whether to make a new post or to post on a previous one on teens but I think that living away changes the experience quite a lot so I figured it would be helpful to open a new thread.   As some of you know my father was diagnosed with PLS. I am from Spain where he still lives but I currently live in Princeton NJ where I am pursuing a Ph.D. For this reason I would be interested in knowing about the experience of people who live away from their parents. I have considered moving back but I think at this point it will only make my father sad and depressed as if the disease were also preventing me from fulfilling my projects. I have decided to wait and see how the disease develops which so far has been slowly before making a decision.  So far my mother is the primary carer (57(. My brother who is younger is considering going back near home to begin medical school but he also lives far away at the moment. Thanks to the perks of academic life I come back quite often spending over a month for Christmas and three months over the Summer in addition to spare weeks throughout the year. Since I work on a discipline for which I do not need a lab (pure math) I could even do some of my research from home.  However there are of course a lot of things I am missing and it is sometimes very stressful to not be sure what is going on at home. I am seeing a therapist but I would appreciate if people could share their own experiences whether they decided to move back or not and how things went generally.

43975,2019-03-27 00:00:00,First ALS Clinic Visit,Yesterday we had our first ALS Clinic visit. I think my PALS was overwhelmed by all of the people. He says he is very tired.  He was diagnosed 3 1/2 years ago but was pretty much on a plateau until about 2 months ago when he seems to have fallen off a cliff. For the first 3 years his left hand and arm were affected and not much else. Now it seems like ALS has spread its tentacles throughout his body. He is having trouble sleeping because his breathing capacity decreases when he is lying down. Despite my trying to prop him up with a wedge pillow and more he doesn't like them and ends up in a chair. His speech is starting to sound muddy. His legs are weakening and his right hand shows signs of going the same way as his left. He is tired all the time. He also resists my attempts to feed him because he has acid reflux as well.  I was somewhat emotional at clinic; I had hopes that his progression would continue along a slow path. The Dr. thinks it is still slow but he will end up quite disabled. The Dr. also brought up the possibility that FTD is raising its ugly head. I am already emotionally exhausted not sure how I will do over a 10-year stint at this. We were going to travel next month but I have canceled it because he says he cannot do it.   We will be starting Bipap when it is ordered; I'm hoping it will help him to feel less exhausted. The ALS Association rep is going to come out and look at my impossible house and tell me if anything can be done to modify it. Meanwhile I'm still running my business (part time) and trying to deal with all of his issues that he can't deal with. I'm trying to hold off scheduling appointments for him until next week as he just needs to rest and process it all.   No other way to put it. ALS just sucks.,False,vltsra,2015-11-12 00:00:00,580,CALS,2015-11-01 00:00:00,US,CA,San Diego,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/first-als-clinic-visit.43975/

43444,2019-01-12 00:00:00,Depressed,There is no one size fits all and we are all so different. It is why I find a place like this is so effective - all the different sizes can be compared to your own situation and you may find what fits by seeing the differences here    Many CALS take an AD and find it incredibly beneficial and should never be made to feel inadequate for doing so just because another CALS didn't take one.  For me I reached a point where I felt like I was constantly screaming inside. That is still the only way I can describe it. I went on a low dosage of zoloft and I felt completely 'myself' but minus the screaming. I still felt everything I was not in any kind of fog or numbness or haze. I still felt so sad terrified and even angry that this was all happening but I could keep my nose above the water level.  I also saw a counsellor that really worked well with me and I talked and vented and ranted and got amazing tips here and on a private CALS fb group.  So for me it was a combination of all those things that helped me with that emotional side.   And some days just are better than others - the tide of grief does ebb and flow and there are some huge crashing waves out of the blue too. That I think is where for me places where I could talk about it with others that understood really made a huge difference.  I hope you can find the right combination of supports because this sure as sh!t ain't an easy ride!,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/depressed.43444/page-2
43444,2019-01-13 00:00:00,Depressed,Yes I think I am (we are) in a continuous state of grief. I have experienced grief before and this is so overwhelming because while in a normal state of grief as time passes one learns to cope but with this time doesn’t help it just causes more grief.  I so get the ‘screaming inside’ analogy. I think the Lexapro helped with that but it is back which makes me think I need something else. The question is when to have time to find a doctor my gp doesn’t feel qualified to prescribe a change and I just don’t have time to research another doctor. I will have to ‘make’ the time I guess.  Our experiences are all a little different as you all say And it is so helpful to get the support here that we have to make our own path depending on our circumstances. I had no medical background going into this and now feel like I could write a book except I am a terrible writer.   I kind of wish I could close out the outside world as I think the most stressful days are when everyday life closes in with all its issues that have to be taken care of in order to maintain the quality of life my pals has now.

Have been fighting with the insurance company to pay for a part for the wheelchair. They finally agreed today it should have been paid right away and was denied in error. Small victories.

It feels like they should just know everything but it is true that this is a rare disease and looking after a PALS is really different to looking after most illnesses.  I found having to constantly be fighting the little things like that wheelchair part hours we were eligible for good workers and on and on would really deplete my precious energy that I wanted to spend doing things for Chris personally or just being with him in some nice way.  I'm afraid they very likely do deny many things just to see how many they can get away with. One wonders how much it saves when they have to deal with someone fighting it but then maybe they get away it so many times the odd fight is insignificant to them. Sadly to us that is another huge drain on our reserves. xxx,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/depressed.43444/page-2
43444,2019-01-15 00:00:00,Depressed,Yes you are right. Handling everything is hard enough without having to fight insurance companies for benefits that we are entitled to. The heartlessness of these organizations is amazing actually denying benefits that are included in our plan. When I talked with the social worker at the clinic she told us to ask for an ‘advocate’. The ‘advocate’ told us she has no control over anything to do with benefits or navigating the insurance bureaucracy and she ‘couldn’t help us’. What is her purpose then? I have learned we all have to blaze our own trail through this. It takes precious time away from what’s left of our life together and it makes me so mad sometimes I could scream.,True,ARCG,2016-10-12 00:00:00,204,Lost a loved one,2015-01-01 00:00:00,US,TX,Houston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/depressed.43444/page-2
43231,2018-12-10 00:00:00,Sleeping and tube feeding,Ernie this is how I would look at it and how I did with Chris.  The digestive system will slow down as the body weakens and then it takes a lot of calories for them to digest what they do take in. A point is reached and as a CALS our gut feeling means more than any science.  If you feel she is better sleeping and slipping in peace then don't disturb her. Hospice would support you fully on this.  When you are ready to talk with them about it whether that is today days or weeks away you can discuss discontinuing all nutrition and how you might decide on this.  I wish you so much peace - this is pure love making the really hard decisions for the true best.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/sleeping-and-tube-feeding.43231/

43975,2019-03-28 00:00:00,First ALS Clinic Visit,Very sorry to hear about the speed up in progression.   Re breathing while lying down is there a plan for a hospital bed? It can really help with or without BiPAP and will also be useful for transfers.  As far as the reflux if feeding pace is an issue and the food he's eating is as benign as you can make it you might consider food the consistency of shakes (like soups puddings soufflés etc.) that he could drink with a large bore straw for more pacing. Don't know if there's still an opportunity finger food for the right hand as well.  If he really has FTD I doubt you will still be at this several years from now V. But if he is showing signs this would be a good time to ensure his advance directive powers of attorney etc. are complete.

43975,2019-03-28 00:00:00,First ALS Clinic Visit,"I'm so sorry V. So very very sorry.  Laurie is right--if FTD is starting you won't have 10 years (and with a bad case of FTD neither of you would want that much time). I second Laurie's recommendation that you make sure all of his wishes are recorded and that you have the necessary POAs. Matt had told me to disconnect him if he became unable to communicate but we never considered the possibility that his brain would go and that he would be able to talk but without any sense of reality. His very last coherent communication with me was to make sure I did not leave him alive if his mind was gone.   That sounded harsh but it's important. Once you have that in place then you can focus on comfort and dealing with the present.  Matt took meds for reflux once he started having stomach problems. Sometimes we focus so much on the nuerological and pulmonary aspects of ALS that we don't treat ""normal"" medical issues that complicate things.  The hospital bed is a great idea.

43975,2019-03-28 00:00:00,First ALS Clinic Visit,Clinic is always a long day and can be overwhelming - especially when there are lots of changes. So much information to process. DH and I always need time to decompress afterward.  DH has some reflux but the bigger problem for him is feeling uncomfortably full after just a few bites. He is on 2 different meds but also feels that medical marajuana helps.   My DH's progression has also been fairly slow in some areas. He has lost his arms/hands and legs but breathing swallowing and talking are fairly stable. So I consider us at a plateau. I'm at times just emotionally exhausted already yet I know that our cliff is still somewhere on the horizon.  I hope the ALS rep can help you figure out your house. We had a wonderful lady from our county office on aging and disability come out and look over our place before we renovated.

43975,2019-03-28 00:00:00,First ALS Clinic Visit,Thank you all for the great suggestions and especially for the support. I did ask the clinic about a hospital bed but they didn't think it was necessary at this point. I still think it might help him a lot. I hate to see him in his chair all night. I also hope that the Bipap will help him.  This morning I made him scrambled eggs with ham. He was eating and then told me he was nauseous and almost brought it back up. I told him not to eat so quickly! Put the fork down in between bites. There is no hurry we aren't going anywhere today. So he slowed down and finished his plate. He was doing some CBD before but stopped it. It might help with the anxiety and appetite too.  I frankly don't think it is FTD at this point. The doctor does not know him. He tends to wallow and give up; I told the doctor that. The doctor just saw him when he was a bit unresponsive and very down. He is on an antidepressant now after I begged him to start taking it again and the doctor wants me to increase his dose starting in a week.  It was hard to cancel our trip. We went to Greece last year and he had such a wonderful time. He was very gregarious and talked with everyone loved the food loved the whole experience. So I planned a return trip. As of January he was still doing well enough to go. He always promised me he would travel with me one day. I am very very thankful we went last year. We have some wonderful memories. It's just hard on both of us to have to give everything up. I am worried about the house. He does have a rental nearby that I think could work but it is hard to kick out the tenants move from here and adjust.   Anyway thank you again. I've been here on the forum for 3 1/2 years and just so appreciate the wealth of knowledge and support.

43975,2019-03-30 00:00:00,First ALS Clinic Visit,I'm starting to understand why the doctor thought it might be FTD. He has been very withdrawn and uncommunicative. He has done this in the past before ALS when he is ill; he ruptured his Achilles tendon 15 years ago and stayed in bed for nearly a month despite doctor's orders. I am hoping it is a combination of depression which we are treating and breathing issues which we will deal with when we get the Bipap.  I have been speaking with him about several things including eating. I told him I will take care of him but I cannot do this alone he has to help. He has to make an effort to eat interact and try to find things he enjoys doing. I know it is a blow to him to have to give up the physical activity he so enjoyed.   Meanwhile I have put a shower chair in the shower with a hose unit also bought him a walker today. I told him I want to be able to get him out and take him places...he has enjoyed going to the casino with his sister on occasion and I could take him out with me when I paint. I'm hoping he can still take part in these activities. Since we cancelled Greece I was hoping to perhaps take him to one of our nearby national parks instead which I know he enjoys. With the walker and the wheelchair (he's not yet in a power chair) it should be possible while he is still able. At least I hope so.

44350,2019-05-08 00:00:00,Wishes Expectations and Ideas,I don;t know if I have questions or if I am just venting. When a challenge arises I can usually figure it out.  So my brother has ALS and just turned 60 last month. I am 55 and his co-caregiver. His symptoms started 1 year ago and now he can't move anything but his head and he can barely hold that up. He and his wife talked years ago about end of life cares ie. no feeding tubes or breathing tubes as well as DNR and is so stated in his medical directive. I asked her about this today and she told me he said he is not ready to go. He has a PEG tube and uses a bi-pap and I imagine he will eventually go with a tracheostomy for breathing. So I am a little confused but I guess that is his decision and I won't doubt him on it. He is doing Radakava and Riluzole but after his fall in December he has progressed fast.  His wife had a moment the other day when the conversation turned to taking the Riluzole or not and she vented to him about it. She can't understand why he wants to live like this and prolong the inevitable. She said to him I Love you but you are dying and maybe you haven't accepted it. You're dying but I am dying too. You're killing me I am stuck here I cant even go for a walk unless someone is here. Soon you will be in that bed 24 hours a day Is that what you want to be laying there with a diaper on? He said I want to stick around for a while. She said what kind of life is this there is no quality of life here.   I get it and I understand both sides of it.  Now back to my issues...  Previously we had been using a sit to stand for transfers from power chair to shower/commode chair but that is not working anymore. Today we used the u-sling I borrowed from the hospital to transfer from power chair to shower chair for his shower under a heated tent in the garage (their house is not set up as well as it could be) It went fairly well considering it was the first time doing this. We did had some issues with getting his shorts on and off while he was in the chair. I am not sure how it would be to do this while he was in the Hoyer sling.  I like to plan ahead so any thoughts or ideas would be helpful for me. Does anyone have any ideas on a way to make the processes easier? What can we expect in the days/months to come? Whats next? How long does he have? Will he be bed ridden? if so how do we care for him then? Like I said earlier when a challenge arises I can usually figure it out  Tired but still going Jon,False,noh1m,2019-05-04 00:00:00,7,Lost a loved one,2018-09-01 00:00:00,US,ND,Hillsboro,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/wishes-expectations-and-ideas.44350/

He said that he thinks about waking me numerous times during the night and even if he did I would only be able to reassure him. He feels claustrophobic and worries about his breathing. He doesn't want to use the nose mask and thinks some of his problems with his breathing has to do with his anxiety/panic.

44109,2019-04-14 00:00:00,need for advice,Hi Najib very sorry to hear about your dad.  It looks like the closest ALS association for you is in  Malta  but they may know of some resources closer to you so I would certainly reach out.  Your dad needs a wheelchair so he will not fall. Do you know how to get one?   For defecating getting enough water is important and having enough time on the toilet as the muscles that help that get weaker. If he can't go for a long time he may need an enema or care at the hospital. Warm liquids can help if he doesn't get enough of those.  For the swollen hand make sure you are massaging the swelling toward the end of the fingers in long firm strokes holding your own fingers on both sides of his hand at the same time so you are massaging on both sides at once. And when he is sitting or lying down including when doing massage his arms should be supported and elevated with elbows bent not hanging down.  You might try to arrange a video consult with a specialist in Portugal or Malta or a clinic that has a Morocco connection in some way? Have you consulted at the closest medical school (Rabat?) or nursing agency?  I wish I knew more about health care there but all of us find that the more calls we make/emails we send the more help reveals itself. Do not give up Najib. Help is out there.

44109,2019-04-16 00:00:00,need for advice,"Karen has pointed out that I should have been more specific about massage.  If you only have a minute for massage just trying to ""even out"" the fluid in the hand while keeping it elevated will help whichever direction of massage that takes (up or down).  If you have more time it is good to go all the way up the arm to work with circulation as fully as possible. The same is true for the feet if that becomes an issue.   Edema of any kind is helped with a steady fluid intake sitting/lying down with the joints supported (you can do this even with foam scraps or pillows) and changing position as much as possible.   Does your dad have a hospital bed or a recliner?   I encourage you to look at dotmed an international marketplace for medical equipment. There are Moroccan dealers there.  Also Google Peace Wheels a project looking to bring more wheelchairs to Morocco. I don't think it's been done as yet but they might have some leads for you.

44131,2019-04-18 00:00:00,Matress trouble,"Beauty makes a good point. I was focusing only on the pillow but strongly believe everyone less mobile should have an overlay -- often latex because a medical grade foam mattress is just not forgiving enough for the pressure points that develop from immobility and atrophy. The right natural latex is more breathable. It's cheaper and easier to mix and match a standard mattress w/ an overlay than buy a super high-tech mattress that may not work.   You can find very reasonable ""green"" latex overlays on Amazon and elsewhere. The one I'm using myself is ""Pure Green"" 3"" soft (over a $100 mattress mind you).

40910,2018-03-28 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,SO sorry about not letting you all know how we are doing. We both came out of the hospital sick. I'm feeling much better but something is still lingering. I can't seem to get enough sleep... The more I get the more I want. Imagine that.  Matt is doing better with the trach. Unfortunately the mucus plugs and excessive saliva have set in but we have a wonderful nurse who has a list of things to try (on top of all the good advise I've gotten here).   I'm adjusting very quickly to having other people in the house. The more the merrier!!  I did what I said I would and ordered Jenny Craig. Now that Matt is on the feeding tube full time I figured I'd make life as easy as possible. Now of course he wants specific things blended for his tube. I get it and we're happy to do it but I guess I will keep having to make the trip to the grocery store.  I've been working like crazy trying to put the house back in order after moving out of my closet to make room for the flood of supplies that arrived even before we got home. Two rooms were full of boxes. Then there was the taxes and all the mail and bills that needed tending to... I'm almost there so maybe now I can sleep. I've claimed a guest room down the hall as my space. I still sleep on the twin bed next to him at night but I now have a place for my cloths where I can dress in peace and a place for napping during the day. It's a luxury.  It's ironic--after four years of constant going and changing and doing it pretty much alone I now have more help and more leisure than I've had till now. Unfortunately now that I'm relaxing my body is taking it's revenge for all the stress. I am blessed that I have the chance to do a bit of me maintenance while my darling is still here--I just hope that I've got my energy back by the time he wants to start getting out and about again.  maybe it's time for a nap...  Oh here's a real hoot. I was exhausted one night and went to bed without eating. At some point during the night I woke hungry and I remember wishing that someone would put food in my G Tube. I don't have a G Tube of course and as soon as I realized that I was disappointed that I had to wake up fully to feed myself.   no...about that nap....

I am glad that you and Matt are doing a bit better/on the mend. Although you have been at this longer than I have I know what you mean about going it alone. So far I have only had help on the one weekend day per month that I must work to maintain my license. Everything else I have done on my own including independently driving Dave &amp; I to FL and back; it was well worth the work as once we were settled we had 6 weeks in the warmth &amp; sunshine rather than the harsh and bleak PA Winter in Feb! I also can relate to your comment about the onslaught of all the equipment etc. We have a relatively small home with a very open floor plan. It was perfect for us while Dave was well. Now I feel like I have a ton of equipment and supplies and I've spent a small fortune on Rubbermaid type trunks/boxes to store things in our basement or garage. I have a totally weird sleep schedule (hence the replies at 2-3:00 a.m. from me) because Dave calls me via the ""baby"" monitor multiple times per night for adjustment of positioning the urinal etc. Yesterday I finally got some sleep at some point after 5:00 a.m. compliments of Zanac. I also feel like you - like I could sleep an entire day if I was given the chance. I think this is an escape mechanism of sorts as well as non-stop emotional fatigue for the past 2 years.  I hear Dave call me even when he really is not  - as my mind plays tricks on me. I awake startled and stumble into the living room only to find that thankfully he is just fine. I seem to be like a new mother in a way who is in tune with every little odd sound or change of breathing pattern from Dave. We only have one downstairs bedroom which is approx. 25' away from where Dave sleeps in the living room. So I am very close but not right next to him.

I was supposed to have a nurse and an aide here Friday plus another nurse doing training.  I had to send the aide to the doctor because of a persistent cough. No problem I had two nurses coming.  I was up and down all night so I really really planned to go back to bed when they arrived.  My favorite nurse walked in the door wearing a mask. She had a low grade fever and had thrown up the night before but felt so bad about the fact that she was supposed to be training that she showed up to find out what I wanted her to do. Silly rabbit.  I told her to go home that I would do the training (so much for the nap). She was so woozy that she said she would nap in her car before driving home. Nonsense I took her upstairs and put her to bed then came back down to start my shift    SHe slept 8 hours. She felt so bad when she got up that she called AAA to take her and her car home. When one of the company owners called to say he'd heard I nursed the nurse we agreed that as a mother of young children she probably got more sleep at my house than she would have at home.  At the end of the day Matt approved the ""training' nurse for duty and she is here today.

44350,2019-05-09 00:00:00,Wishes Expectations and Ideas,Someone like a good PT or OT might be able to help you on the practicalities of how to do what you are doing with your exact setup and his level of functionality. My husband was rapid progression so I was changing my strategies all the time there isn't one simple answer. However some others here may chime in with great tips to try!  So far as what you can expect this is the most difficult part of this disease - everyone is so different we can't predict.   The breathing is the big issue we can live without moving limbs. If he elects a vent we can't even predict. Some people don't adjust well or their breathing is still so rapidly declining that it only gives them a few months and not always good ones. Others adjust really well and live on for 5 10 years or more. Predicting in advance where your brother will sit is just impossible really.  He may become bed bound but if you have a good PWC he should be able to spend most of his day up and very comfortable in it. You may end up electing for bed bathing rather than a shower or doing a shower just once or twice a week.  You may want to discuss having help come in either to help directly with him or to help with other daily chores to give his wife more time with him depending on what she would find most supportive. Hospice are not about purely end of life but you need to check out what is available there really carefully as it seems the organisations really differ within any area.  I hope that helps a little bit even if it's not maybe the answers you were hoping for ❤,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/wishes-expectations-and-ideas.44350/

Watching TV reading etc.  There are many types of masks so when he's more calm he may find a better one.   If he is not falling asleep deeply enough it could be settings that can be adjusted but it sounds like he needs some ""desensitization"" first.

44326,2019-05-07 00:00:00,Bipap anxiety,My brother has anxiety and panic attacks as well as being claustrophobic. He takes 1 Lorazapam at bedtime and that seems to help for a little while as it only lasts for a couple hours but it does calm him enough to get somewhat comfortable. His concern was not being able to wake his wife if he was in distress so we got an enabling device called the twitch switch that is taped to his forehead. We got it from the ALSA loan pool. All he has to do is raise his eyebrow to activate a pager that his wife has next to her bed. It seems to lessen his anxiety.   That being said there are other issues that wake him up in turn his wife gets up and then I get the call to go over to fix the problem. One of which is if the bi-pap mask isn't adjusted just right he gets air leaks when laying down or if the pillows under his arms head or legs are not just right or the twitch switch goes off because of an adjustment or sensitivity setting.  I really hope your husband can get over his anxiety and I pray you both can get some rest.

44326,2019-05-07 00:00:00,Bipap anxiety,Thanks Laurie and Jon.  We got a new mask today. Thank goodness for 1 day shipping. The mask that he had was tearing up his nose even with a bandaid on and we only used it for a few days. We did adjust it a lot but it didn’t help.  The new one rests under his nose and over his mouth. Since it’s lower on his face he said it is less claustrophobic. We’ll see how the night goes. I feel pretty confident that the DME provider doesn’t supply this mask. If all goes well tonight we’ll call tomorrow but even if they don’t we’ll stay with this one if he likes it.  I’m really excited to hear about the twitch switch. Right now we use a pager that has a button for him to press but I was really worried about what I would do when he can’t press the button anymore.

44326,2019-05-12 00:00:00,Bipap anxiety,Thanks everyone.  So far the new mask is working out better. His nose is healing and he doesn't feel as closed in as he did with the other one. Since it sits under the nose in addition to over the mouth it needs a little more adjusting but it's ok. It turns out the Trilogy provider could provide the mask which is nice too.  His doctor prescribed Ativan which he hasn't taken yet. I think just knowing that he could have it has helped. Also the machine needs to be adjusted since it does an annoying cyclical rattling of the hose. They are coming on Wednesday to fix it. He might be able to sleep better if he didn't have that bothering him.  Right now he has a button to push to call me if he needs me.

We can't keep withdrawing and never adding to the bank. That being said the question is HOW to get the sleep. Sounds like you've already decided another room--hope that does it. I've had to go to a sleeping med that I take every few nights (when the account gets empty). I know it's a risk to be sleeping so soundly but there's a bigger risk of ""losing it"" by going too long without sleep. Also I notice the more tired I am the less I am able to tune out the machines so the less sleep I get so the more tired I am. It's a vicious cycle that has to be broken.

39014,2017-07-05 00:00:00,Struggling,Ok small update. Last night I slept on the living room couch. The break from all the noise was wonderful however this couch is. Not like my old one and sleeping there won't work but it gave me a chance to see what removing the noise would do. I had thought about the office area but that would have meant sleeping on the floor in an already crowded space that doesn't seem peaceful as it is now so I opted for the couch.   The biggest obstacle to using the office room is getting both the work desk and the home desk out and putting them somewhere else. I'm not sure putting them in our bedroom is ideal esp if I can get some help even if for short periods. It would help while trying to work and care for him but overall not ideal.   Then there is the upstairs bedrooms for either sleeping or working. Right now DD occupies her bedroom and will continue to do so on and off until she finishes her PT degree. The other room that was DS's is an option but currently is DD's staging area for moving. There are 2 twin beds in there so another trial is possible but right now getting to the beds is nearly impossible. Once she moves mid August that will open that area up. She is going thru the totes she brought home from her undergrad apt. Sorting things that may not need to go and assessing what she needs. She lived with 3 other girls so they shared kitchen items and the place was furnished.   Just left a message for the therapist left my number and availability. Her machine says she works T F and Sat so I will wait for a return call.  Moving forward little by little. Will work on options.

I have the opposite problem now...when I get too tired Matt can't wake me when he tries. I keep talking about putting a doorbell on my side of the bed but it just seems so silly to use a doorbell when I'm right next to him!! Ah ALS how you tap the limited of our flexibility and creativity. I'm finding myself getting cranky when he taps me for the third time in three hours and I feel bad because he really doesn't abuse me.  On the other hand I'm now quick to retort when my poor darling makes the mistake of saying something that sounds like I'm getting plenty of sleep or not getting enough done. After all he said you come to bed by 9 and don't get up until 7...that's 10 hours of sleep. Well as they say that's when the fight started. Well no fight but I reminded him how many times he wakes me and how few uninterrupted hours I get. I've read so many horror stories here that I cut him no slack when he says the wrong thing.   Sue I don't know how to rest your back. It's easy to tell you to do it but as we all know much harder to execute...  The absolute wrost for me is feeling un or under appreciated. If I've just spent four straight hours tending him and he complains about something I do wrong I tell him to do the math and then remind him gently that he can tell me I've done something wrong and that's ok just don't harp on it like I am careless or did it on purpose.

43198,2018-12-10 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,"We so DO understand what you are feeling. It is overwhelming full of uncertainty and is all wrapped up in a sense of grief and helplessness unlike anything you've ever felt. It is not a good place to be. But those of us who will now share this time with you have likely felt most everything you now do. I wish I could tell you that there was a shortcut around those feelings... but there is not. I wish I could tell you that you could run through them to make the process faster in its experience... but you cannot. I wish that I could tell you that you could close your eyes tap your heels thrice and it would all be gone. Unfortunately we're not in Kansas anymore. What I can tell you difficult as it might be to believe is that it does get better. Let me see if I can describe some of my experience in the hopes that it might give you another point of view.  I told my wife Darcey that I felt like we were on a train. We didn't ask to be on this train but we're here nonetheless. It has one destination not one WE picked... but the one that ALS picks. And want as we may we simply cannot get off. We are joined on this train by some equally wonderful people who didn't want to be here. So what can we do? Really there's not a damned thing we can do but ride this train. And though we know where it leads we don't precisely know when it we will get there.  As has been said each ""ride"" is different. I think it was easier for us because we'd gone through a year of life on hold waiting to get better. And she wasn't getting better. Rather than the despair that would often accompany a diagnosis of ALS we actually felt relief. I know it sounds silly but consider this. We had just spent a year going nowhere and doing nothing. And during that year nothing got better. With the Johns Hopkins diagnosis of ALS we suddenly could find some certainty as to what Darcey was going through... and what I was perpetually trying to react to in my support and caregiving role. With that diagnosis we could read and begin to understand that likely course that ALS would run. With uncertainty removed we could begin to plan again... to live again... to more fully love again.  Darcey and I were married in 1984. Compared to stories from friends regarding their relationships... views from the outside of others we knew... ours was indeed a marriage of ""peace love &amp; joy"". We had disagreements but we really never fought. It did indeed seem to be a dream marriage. Looking back we both agree that ALS changed the relationship that we’d had. It took on a whole new depth. Roles changed. I am now the sole income producer homemaker caregiver shopper cleaner etc. My time became a premium item as I now had more to do than there was time to do all these new things. But we talked more. It wasn’t how much more we talked but how much more deeply openly and honestly we talked. It seems incongruous… but we might never have known this depth of love were it not for ALS.  Again Thomas933 this is my path and how it has run. Yours will be different as it will be all your own. And as overwhelming as it right now is I truly believe you will find a way to anchor yourself and begin to pull things back into a perspective that you can work with. For now take it moment by moment. Feel free to come sit with us here in the forums. Let us know what you’re feeling and we’ll try to help you find something to hang onto. Again I will remind you that you are not alone.

When we got home we cried and felt helpless and devastated and cheated. I took our dogs to the park and sat on a bench and thought about things tried to get my head around what we had just learned. On my way home I picked up a very special bottle of wine and I took it home and told him we were going to make the most of it. We planned a cruise got married drank nice wine and dined at good restaurants- things we loved to do. We tried to do as much as we could early on. I’m so glad we did all of it.  In the beginning I read a tonne about ALS and found a lot of it very overwhelming. After the shock passes and you find your feet you will be amazed what you can do. Never doubt yourself. Your love for your husband will guide you through. You will be amazed to discover you are practically a superhero.   I have found starting a meditation practice has helped me a lot in coping with our new life. With sleeping with calming myself with just getting through the more difficult days. There are some great apps you can put on a smartphone and it’s a good way to give it a go if you are so inclined. I use one called ‘Insight timer’. It’s free and full of thousands of guided meditatins meditation music and talks. Or you could find a book on mindfulness meditation or look on YouTube. For me at least it’s been very helpful.  All the best to you and your family. It’s good you have found this forum. It is a tremendous resource and the people are amazing and so supportive. Sometimes it just helps so much to know you aren’t alone in what you are going through.

43198,2018-12-13 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,"Hi Thomas - I just joined this forum myself so apologies in advance for any cluelessness about how this all works but your post is the first I saw and just wanted to offer a couple of quick comments/resources.  My husband was diagnosed almost 2 years ago to the day. We were 47 then. My girls were 12 and 15.  First off the MGH ALS clinic is awesome. We are so lucky to live near some of the best medical care in the country and world and some of the best people for ALS care (my husband was a biotech executive and worked in the neuromuscular area so he and his medical colleagues knew that MGH is among the best). Hopefully that provides some reassurance. I know it did for us (the disease itself is bad enough but the last thing you want is to ever question the care you are receiving). We also had to wait several weeks until January. Though it was an agonizing several weeks it was worth the wait.  There is so much to process upon this awful diagnosis but one of the early ones was how to tell people - our kids our family our friends coworkers etc. We had had a winter vacation planned and we decided to wait until after before telling them - decided to let them enjoy one last blissfully unaware normal vacation.  The most amazing resource we found to help how to approach things with the kids (as well also others) was the PACT Program - Parenting at Challenging Times (mghpact.org). Its part of MGH's cancer center but they have worked with the ALS patients too. DEFINITELY reach out to them. Their guidance is beyond invaluable. If you cannot get in touch at least get the book (""Raising an Emotionally Health Child When a Parent Is Sick"").   (If you are interested I am very happy to share the email we sent out - it was a painful to write but was comprehensive great tone etc.)  Finally Compassionate Care ALS (CCALS.org) is a wonderful organization for resources and support in this area. They work very closely with MGH. Definitely reach out to them.   Hope this was a helpful addition to all the amazing words of support from the other members.",True,Turtals,2018-12-11 00:00:00,18,CALS,2016-12-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Newton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/just-found-out-please-help.43198/page-3
43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,Ninja I so agree that we support and enable their choices.  Just make sure his choices are made with full information.  Does he have use of his hands? Is he having saliva issues?  If you have read other threads here it can take weeks to become accustomed to the bipap machine and mask (and may take trial and error to get the right mask). If he has a lot of saliva and no use of his hands this is going to be really difficult. I'm so sorry I don't remember exactly where he is at and so have to ask.  I'm all for bipap - but if the PALS is nearing the end and has little functionality and high fatigue it may not be an easy process at all.  He does need all sides of the situation explained so he can make an informed decision on this.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/02-or-no-02.43109/page-2
43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,"my PALS has no use of his hands/arms/trunk/legs/feet neck and head are okay. There are no saliva issues right now. He was hungry today but couldn't open his mouth past 1cm to get anything in there; first time this has happened. Maybe spasticity in the jaw?  RT said no congestion sounds low grade fever (38.2) and unsure what is going on. He is having tremors (looks like bad chills/not clonus) and not complaining of being too hot or too cold. Rash went away with the benedryl. Not sure what is going on.  I too am worried that he wont easily get accustomed to the bipap so easily at this point. I'm waiting to hear back from a few ppl if we can bypass the hospital/intake program for the bipap and I'm hoping they come back with good news.  RT started him on 2L O2 and his tremors stopped colour got better he said he felt better and O2 sats went from 82 to 90 right away. I'm glad he is a bit more comfortable now and the dr will be by tomorrow to look at him again check for infection/pneumonia and see if we should continue with O2 as needed or get the bipap. I asked my PALS again about bipap not even a few hrs later and he went back to ""not right now maybe down the road"". I think it is because he is getting nervous about this trip to the ICU.",True,NinjaLady,2018-02-08 00:00:00,75,Lost a loved one,2017-04-01 00:00:00,CA,BC,City,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/02-or-no-02.43109/page-2
43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,Ninja I know you are totally supporting his wishes. I meant that if he doesn't want an ICU stay you would be his advocate in that respect as well.   But you say you tried and it didn't work out and I don't know anything about how things work in Vancouver. I guess it's late in the game but for others who might read this in future secondwindcpap does ship BiPAPs internationally if you get an rx from any doc -- doesn't have to be your neuro.   So I guess you go back to him and he has that choice. [edit: our posts crossed so he took a right turn very understandable]. As Nikki says if there is an underlying cause for the O2 drop perhaps they will find it there [or further outpatient testing will reveal it]. And it is true that there are several treatable possibilities.  Decompensation is where the person with ALS takes in so little air over a period of time that their lungs lose the ability to hold it and biochemically do the exchange of CO2 and O2 even if a machine pushes it often with pneumonia and/or lung collapse. So there is a set point where if someone waits too long to do BiPAP it may not work well. From what you say though that may not be the case with your husband at all.   Keep us posted -- anything we can do.  Best Laurie,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/02-or-no-02.43109/page-2
43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,While the use of 02 for PALS is not considered first line treatment you also must keep in mind ALS does not give us a free pass on other morbidities. Most PALS I know tend to live around the low 90s as far as 02 sats. When you drop into the 80 the medical community jumps to 02. The issue with this is the 02 just masks the buildup of C02. The bipap increases the volume of air going in and out of the lungs. Barring no issue with gas exchange this will bring him up to the mid 90s. If he also has copd asthma or some sort of infection going on then by all means use oxygen in conjunction with bipap. My stellar 150 actually has an 02 port on the back for just this sort of case. I would get him in to your clinic to be seen by an RT with ALS experience.

Such fatigue he can't even keep his eyes open and he is usually so alert all the time (never naps).  Will see if I can get a bipap without going to the ICU and if not I leave that to my PALS as to what he wants to do. Just not sure if he is thinking clearly right now.

43109,2018-11-21 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,As his CO2 builds up especially if he is receiving O2 he will get more and more sleepy and maybe he will have headaches too.  I'm so sorry - I have another CALS here in Australia with similar issues - sent home from hospital on O2 and waiting waiting for a call to even start a sleep study before they will consider bipap prescription.

43109,2018-11-22 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,Well pneumonia seems to be the culprit. We are told once that clears up (hopefully does) then he can go off the O2.

43109,2018-11-22 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,Ninja I’m glad the culprit has been identified. I wish your PALS a successful recovery comfort and some better days ahead.  When this current scary episode is resolved I recommend you and your PALS have a frank discussion about the following:  1. BiPAP vs no BiPAP.  2. If BiPAP then tracheostomy vs no trach in the future (realizing that in some cases tracheostomy needs to be done emergently).  3. Whether to treat future infections if this sort of thing happens again vs not treating and going the hospice route.  Recognize that surviving an episode of pneumonia conveys a higher risk of getting pneumonia again in the future so it’s good to know his wishes and be prepared.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/02-or-no-02.43109/page-2

43109,2018-11-25 00:00:00,02 or no 02?!,Thanks Tillie. He is definitely loved. I'm not sure if he is being clingy or needy...asking for something (repetitive things) every 5 minutes it seems during the day and he lets me sleep a good number of hours and then calls for me first thing in the morning to start all over again.   Also he seems to be hearing and seeing a few things that aren't there. I'm reassuring him telling him it is alright etc. He says he feels better than yesterday but is just as week/tired. Hasn't eaten in 5 days. Little sips of water and pineapple juice here and there.  Super slow breaths last night (for him very slow)...every 6 seconds (normally every 1 second) and today HR is 115 and breaths are quick again. BP is normal.  I don't know how long this is going to go on for. Not sure he will come back from this. I'm not sure it was all the pneumonia to blame but rather a bout of progression all at one maybe?! Lost his speech in the last few days can't project sounds even very well/like a whisper can't sip out of a straw anymore can't keep his eyes open.

I sleep in a twin size bed in the same room and its so hard to sleep sometimes. I take a night or two off and sleep in another room. Steve wears a device around his neck that makes a doorbell ring throughout the house in case of emergency. Ahh...who am I kidding. he uses it all the time and I hate that sound.  I am on 100mg of Zoloft and it has helped me. I agree with you concerning the constant needs. I cant even hold a conversation or share with Steve because he nicely cuts me off always asking for something This disease is not only a PALS disease. It also wrecks the CALS.

39014,2017-07-05 00:00:00,Struggling,ok girls space cleared and baby monitor purchased and set up. Tonight we do a trial run and see how it goes. As to the monitor I went 1 step up from the most inexpensive. I can talk back to him through it if need be and it has some nice setting that allow you to adjust what his microphone pays attention to and then I can control the volume on my end. That will take a little tweaking to get both right but seems like a nice way of adjusting things. If it works well it will be worth it's weight in gold.  Becky I think the multiple wake up calls are far worse than only getting 3 or 4 hours of straight sleep. We went through that Spring of 16 when he first lost his voice. He could still make clicking sounds with his tongue then and it was like nails on a chalkboard. Nearly had a breakdown after months of hardly any sleep. As far as DD is concerned if she wasn't having her own issues due to this stupid disease I'd be tougher on her but she just started today with Zoloft herself. Over time we went from same bed to twin pushed up next to the hospital bed the them being separated but still the same room. Now it's onto seperate rooms. A sad progression.  Deb you are so right about this disease affecting the CALS a well. Case in point is how they have the disease but we need meds for it. How does that work??? I have told Brian on more than one occasion when he was acting up that he may be the one in bed with the Dx but we all have it.  Sad but true I'm actually looking forward to being in a different part of the house tonight. Almost feel like going on vacation. We will see.  On another note we are having major issues with his foley getting clogged. 3rd one in two weeks. They are ordering a med that i will use in his flush and see how that goes. If that doesn't help the issue then I guess he'll need admitted to get a supra pubic one placed. Not sure how that will help with clogs if sediment is causing it but we will cross that bridge when we come to it. However I'm not sure he'll agree to a hospital stay esp after the last one.  You know on FB there was a gal querying about vents and whether or not to go that route. I gave an honest reply. For us I think the worst part of it is how it creates the inability to get help and the continued deterioration your PALS goes through which then puts more and more strain on the CALS. The first couple of years it wasn't so bad and had I only been that far in my answer would have been far different than it is today. Definitely not enough info given at least in our case. Part of that may be due to the fact that most vented patients don't make as far as others do. I think even the medical community has a lack of knowledge about what eventually can happen with a vented PALS.  Ok that's it for tonight I'll post in the morning about my sleep.

I have to tell you that I simply cannot imagine looking after a well advanced PALS on a vent for this length of time.

39014,2017-07-06 00:00:00,Struggling,Ok here's today's update. The monitor worked well l kept it low enough I had to concentrate to hear the breathing but if an alarm would have gone off that would have come thru loud and clear.   Sleep well new bed so it was better but my body needs to adjust to a different bed for now. Worst part was my little doggie. He sleeps with me and this really threw him off. He was restless so it woke me a few times poor thing. He wasn't happy with the situation. Some nights he sleeps on Brian's bed and I think the fact he could not see both of us upset him. Then at 5:30 he was done it was time for me to get up or else. : ) So adjustments need made by all of us. I do think for the time I was asleep it may have been a deeper sleep we will see. Not giving up and will try again tonight.   Tillie - I'm hopeful I'll be able to use the monitor to give me more ability to be in other parts of the house or even out on the deck. It's being stained right now but my morning joe out there would be heavenly. Early on I thought it was cruel that other countries don't give the option to vent now though I think it's a good thing esp when there isn't any support. It's sad because you have no idea what you could really be on for and it's so different with each PALS.   Jlynn - no Brian can't operate any kind of doorbell system. He has some limited movement of one thumb but it also moves involuntarily at times so it would just wake us needlessly at times too if we could even make one work with next to zero pressure. Unfortunately we are way past that stage. It's awesome while it can be used. I love my walks when they can be had as well. I do sneak around a small block in the morning with the dog that takes about 5 min. I decided to start since I'm generally out that long with the dog anyway. He usually still asleep. I don't do it later in the day though when he's fully awake. I will get a walk in when DD is here between jobs. And that early morning walk is when DD is still in the house as well.

39014,2017-07-06 00:00:00,Struggling,I am so thrilled that you were able to stay in that bed all night! Can you move your bed into this room? That would cut down on how many adjustments you are making even though it would make this seem more permanent. This bed could go in your room and maybe you could have day naps on it when he is napping in the day or something?  Whatever you decide this is a step forward and that is what is most important!  This monitor could also prove to be another important small step forward if it could allow you just a little time away from his room to do things and to relax. Never underestimate how important it is to have some time to yourself!  With each small step forward I am hoping it will open up more ways you can find help.

39014,2017-07-06 00:00:00,Struggling,Tillie i had to laugh at take a nap when he does because he doesn't nap. The man never was a big sleeper and still isn't. On the rare occasion that he does nap then he's not ready for bed till 11 then we are back up at 6. Always seem to be up around 6 so if I can get to bed around 10 that's better.

43198,2018-12-14 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,"Thomas  Childhood is the transition into adulthood. It would be impossible to do so without sadness and life's unfairness not touching a child's life. In other words life happens so don't feel guilt.   Since you and your husband obviously love and care about the kids it will be difficult to tell them ""wrong"" -- just make sure they do not feel any guilt on their parts (kids can feel from media that everything is down to stress; you can honestly say that we do not know why your husband got ALS) and that they know this doesn't change who you both are and how much they are loved.   They are each old enough to take a role in his care as time goes on and may ask something in that direction but that can be phrased as ""We will all help him in the different ways we can"" rather than as a scary uncertain burden.   My other suggestion would be that you get enough tears out of the way beforehand so as not to look totally overwhelmed when you have this conversation. Kids respond to the courage of your conviction you can and will handle this as a family.   So as an example while the difference between ""he has a disease that will paralyze him and then he will die"" vs. ""he has found out the disease that he will most likely die from and he will need a lot of help from us"" is subtle it may help.

I hope you can sort this out she deserves to be given the best care and to know and participate in that as she is certainly an adult. She can't possibly be given quality care in this situation.

You are not only in a terribly emotional state now but you will live with this. You have choices and can tell her.

Nina you are an adult and your mother's daughter. Keeping a diagnosis from her is not supportable. Lying is not supportable. In order for her to benefit from a feeding tube and BiPAP at all she will need to understand what they are and what they do.   Even people who know they have ALS sometimes take weeks or months to come to terms with new equipment. She will never have the chance to gain from them if you are not honest with her and while you can't cure her you can provide the gift of truth.   We CALS learn early with ALS not to leave anything unsaid to our PALS that would haunt us later. I hope you won't either.

47271,2020-11-08 00:00:00,Sad,My pals has entered the end stages I fear. He is on hospice and we do everything we can to make him comfortable. However he refuses our suggestions that would help with his comfort adjusting bed recliner position etc. I fear he has FTD. I suggest one solution he refuses and 5 minutes later he is indignant because he wants me to do the exact thing I suggested. He has a couple varieties of comfortable masks but often refuses to use them when he needs to during the day. he wears them all night with no issues. He has neck support issues and we have three types of necks supports one of which was made especially for him but gets angry when we try to suggest them. He refuses to wear a neck support and wants me to stand by his chair and lift his head when it drops.  But if I leave the room to clean his masks filters change batteries in shaver fix a meal clean up the kitchen on and on...he complains even though he has an accessible call bell (he is not completely paralyzed and I have it where he can hit it easily). I usually wake up before him and grab some coffee and bring it back to the bedroom after making a pit stop and he told me he wants me to get him up and wait until his morning routine is done before I even go to the bathrooom. It seems he no longer sees me as a human being. We have some help but if I am in the house he will ask me to do whatever even when they are right there. He waits for them to leave and the minute they are gone then asks me to do things they could have done.  I have lost him already even though he is still here. Last night he had me get him up at 3 am to make some adjustments and asked me to put him in his recliner and turn on his computer so he could text. He proceeded to text stuff that made little sense to the current situation mostly blaming me for not understanding his speech (he can no longer talk and I was the last one to understand him when he could). When I asked him if we could text in the morning he said no and we were up until 5 before I convinced him to go back to sleep. Besides text we have other ways to communicate all of which he refuses to use.  I hate this disease we have lost him already I will do everything in my power to help him but it so heartbreaking to have the person you love go through this and look to you for a cure when there is none. He is now blaming hospice for his Illness as well.  i was able to keep him in relatively stable with a good quality of life for a long time but the last few days he has declined quickly. the hospice nurse suggested considering oxygen I will probably take her up on it tomorrow as I fear the end is near and want him to be comfortable.  He is a very good man loving involved father and has lots of integrity. The disease has taken over. Thanks for listening.

Was nervous about the aide even though I liked her that will pass I hope.  Hope you don't mind a little rant. I really have no one who understands what this is like. Everyone tells me I am so strong and doing a good job but that is not what I feel like inside. I am so tired all the time. Still really trying to bring some quality of life into every day for him and think I am succeeding but it is so exhausting managing everything all the time. The mental part and worry is the worst of it I think. Constant adaptation as you all know.  Last week my husband rolled over my bad foot when I was setting up his computer for him with his wheelchair I was worried it was broken again but it seems ok today thank goodness. Not the first time he has accidently hit me with the wheelchair. I have talked to him about it and not to move until I tell him too but that just makes him angry for some reason. We get along fine for the most part but sometimes I feel like I am walking on eggshells I don't want my memories to be of him being angry or us arguing. We were both very independent people before this. He is such a strong positive person in general and I can't imagine the frustration he must feel.

It's weird being called strong and feeling weak. Probably it's like this: while you spend all your energy and strenght it's highly visible for others. They see what you do and and deal with daily. But once that energy is put into tasks and patience and coping you're right drained. That's it. You are strong and to regain that strenght you have to reload your batteries in any way that is becoming to you. The time for yourself (or friends or pets or stranger or anything other than what drained you in the first place) part that's the way. You go girl!  I could imagine him get angry when told to sit tight as that's what the disease is dictating his body. This is an exeption though those wheelchairs are friggin' tanks and it HURTS. I screamed at helpful strangers when trying to board a subway not to touch that thing or they might get hurt. No stopping them.

I do find that when I can get away for a bit I feel better. I have an aide 2x a week for a few hours. I'm still trying to figure out how to balance the errands with me time.  And the wheelchair! My DH is having a lot of trouble with his hands and arms. Last time we were at clinic he asked the wheelchair rep to make the joystick more sensitive so that he could move it better. What an adventure that has been. He has run over my foot run into one doorway so hard that he bent the controller almost to a 90 degree angle and broke the Permobil cupholder that took three months to get right off. ARGH!!!! I got the controller back to a decent angle again ordered a new cupholder (found out that Permobil uses a RAM Mount and just adds their attachment for the arm) and had the tech come out today to re-adjust the sensitivity of the joystick.

When I met Brian my agnostic husband and we first started out I had the feeling that love like ours was in the service of God.   I know I have never lost anyone or anything this important to me. My uncle who was more like a Dad suicided (health issues) back when I was 29 and it was devastating. My father (not his brother) suicided when I was 4 but I barely recall that (I grew up in it another whole story).  I know I will go on because it’s just what you do you have to move forward. I feel all this pre- grief now and grief for the various things we seem to lose weekly or even daily. I want it to end and I dread the end.   I am not sure if Hospice and Morphine helped make it closer or if it’s actually closer. It sure made it feel Closer. Brian said he is breathing easier on his tiny dose of morphine. That makes it official- his breathing has gone downhill from two months ago and the normal readings.

47213,2020-10-30 00:00:00,Uncontrollable accidents,Yes both bladder and bowel incontinence were problems for my husband. If your husband is still walking he may need depends or some version thereof. Mine was in the chair when this started so we kept pads under him all the time and planned travel around his bowels. I did cleanups in the van when he could no longer stand and we had timed things poorly. I think my being prepared by having read this forum allowed me to act like it was nothing--I told him it was normal and I was expecting it and I was just matter of fact about it. I believed that helped him. The highpoint was the day I was moving him to the bathroom from bed using the ceiling lift and track. I made the mistake of bending over to pick something up as he was passing over me. Yep you guessed it. Thankfully it was a solid poop and bounced right off my head.

We got her on the commode four times per day on average and the depends were typically wet but not uncomfortably so. She wore a somewhat more absorbent overnight variety and those were pretty well soaked in the morning. She had a cloth chuck under her at night which got varying degrees of wet but if we stuck with newer chucks it almost never went through to the sheets. I would say she found the underwear quite comfortable. We tried a few different kinds before settling on Tena for daytime and Tranquility Premium Over-night for nighttime.

It may also be worth having some palliative meds on hand as if his breathing is declining he could experience some distress. Maybe he even is feeling a little distress and some meds would help.

I told myself that so many things will be falling away for him that I have to deal w. my own fear and just let him go. That was hard for me.  A few days before the trip he cancelled it.

43793,2019-02-27 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,"Darcey showed her first indications of ""something being wrong"" in Nov of 2012. Through all of 2013 they chased a misdiagnosis of CIDP. In the spring of 2014 she was referred to Johns Hopkins for another opinion. The doctor asked Darcey for information on how she was feeling and what she'd noticed. After she answered and he discussed her answers he asked me the same question about Darcey... from MY point of view.   I told the doctor that I'd noticed that Darcey was losing weight... and doing so at a rate that seemed much to rapid to be healthy. I also explained that she'd fall asleep multiple times during the day. In fact it had gotten so bad that we'd be in the middle of a conversation and she'd fall asleep. I mentioned that at night she wasn't comfortable laying flat in the bed. Laying flat made her feel like she couldn't breath well. Sleeping at a slight incline she felt much better. He nodded his head and went on with his questions and fact finding. Before we left that first visit the doc said something along these lines...   I know this isn't what you would like to hear but I'm pretty certain that you have ALS not CIDP. We'll run all the tests you've already taken but we'll do them to verify our findings. Before you go home today I'll call in a prescription for a BiPAP machine to help you with your breathing. He continued...   ""The reason you are losing weight is that you are having problems breathing correctly... and especially at night. Your body is trying to get rid of CO2 that is building up but it is having problems doing so. At night you're working so hard to breath and to get rid of the CO2 that it is like being in a marathon. You're actually burning calories and that is what is causing the weight loss.   From the first moment that Darcey got the BiPAP she began to feel better. For quite some time she only used it at night. She regained energy that she hadn't realized had been lost. She quit losing weight. And she quit falling asleep and feeling like she needed to sleep all of the time. She really felt as if she was atop the world again.   I don't know if this is what your husband is experiencing or if it is something else. But by knowing what Darcey went through you all can try to determine if this same type of thing might be what is causing your husband's feeling of needing to sleep so much. Anyway... that is our story. I hope it helps you find your own.   Again my best...

Three medications my GI specialist put me on is Domperidone Pruclapride and Prevacid. I have had problems with Fatty Liver disease lost my gallbladder back in 1985 but I get times when I get gravelly bile ducts which tends to cause gas but slowly resolves itself over weeks. If the diaphragm has flipped it can cause severe upper mid abdominal pain. I have to eat puréed food and use feeding tube pump IsoSource at very small amounts at a time. IsoSource at 150ml hr if I run it faster I get gas pain. I have gastroparesis where my GI tract empties very slowly. For that I take Restoralax and fish oil.

He was getting the liquid morphine on request but the last time he was awake he expressed that since he can't ask for it when he sleeps he is in pain each time he wakes.

41221,2018-07-24 00:00:00,Drained,Twins! How exciting I don't have grandchildren but have heard from my friends it is wonderful.  My daughter sent me pictures in advance of several dresses/styles she found on the Internet and Intold her which ones I liked. As it turned out we were on the same page. She then sent me pictures from the bridal salon of ones she was trying on and picked one that is just stunning and was one of the ones I originally liked. I had tears in my eyes. Yes I would have loved to be there and we had some technology issues of course but the pictures were lovely and she took the time to put her hair up and the consultant put flowers in her hair so she looked beautiful. You are right it is a bright spot in this otherwise heartbreaking time. And as my daughter said it is 2018 not 1918 and we are lucky to have the technology to do this. I was multitasking looking at pictures and feeding my husband. When he would take a bite I would turn to look at the screen and comment.  On another note we had a windstorm Sunday and I went out to 'batten down the hactches' and something flew in my eye after flushing it etc. after two nights it's still there.

I will miss her when she goes back but we will keep in touch with FaceTime etc.  My eye is finally better what a relief. My neighbors were power washing their house during the windstorm and I think it was a piece of stucco.  The aide I have on Thursdays is working out although she will be on vacation for three weeks soon about the time my daughter goes back to school. I was able to get so much done in those few hours groceries washed the car went to dr. even bought a new pair of more comfortable cushiony shoes to wear around the house everyday. What a difference It reminds me of when I was working my way through college as a waitress and was on my feet all the time wish I had thought of it before now. I thought my shoes and slippers were comfortable but I would have never waited tables wearing them.  I showed my husband how to do the text to speech application on his computer his speech is getting worse and he picked it up pretty quickly. Now I am trying to figure out some kind of bell or call button he can hit with his foot when he wakes up as sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and go out to the couch which isn't far but I drop off around dawn and so far have been awake when he wakes up but worry that exhaustion may win,True,ARCG,2016-10-12 00:00:00,204,Lost a loved one,2015-01-01 00:00:00,US,TX,Houston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/drained.41221/page-4

41449,2018-05-20 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Actually the truth is more the reverse.

41449,2018-05-20 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Lenore I think it would be a mixture of VSED and morphine titration. Getting a good relationship with hospice now is going to really stand you both in good stead when the time comes for end of life decisions. This is regardless of what decisions he makes and at what stage.

41449,2018-05-20 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Yet actually Titration g Morphine is a step a lot of Doctors in my experience are not ready to play with until the end is pretty near and by that I don’t mean an end at the time of your choosing. That’s controlled by a willingness to administrate in a facility and a willingness to give refills outside of a facility.   It would be nice if we could get our Rx and just titrate away but not so simple with a controlled substance. I saw this myself working in hospice and that piece is real too.  VSED however is legal and possible at any stage. He w long it actually takes us highly variable. Odds are excellent it will not go past 21 days but with serious comfort care cooperation that would be one hell of a long time.

41449,2018-05-20 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Lenore I hope that by getting a good relationship with those in charge of dispensing morphine you will be at ease. Usually you start out with fairly low doses and don't get to give large frequent doses for long because of the impact ALS already has on the breathing. It may take less morphine than you anticipate to go through the end stages.  I know what my Chris's first wife was receiving as she went through the end of cancer with brain secondaries and what he received here at home in his end days.

If our PALS is depressed then the monster is winning.  Let alone the impact of those 3 things on us as CALS - if our PALS doesn't sleep well you can bet we don't. If they are fatigued we are doing more. If they are depressed we are trying to bring us both back up to a higher more positive place.

47381,2020-11-22 00:00:00,New Assistive Communication Device,Friday my PALS received his Talk to Me assistive communication device. After a frustrating attempt yesterday (I couldn't get it set up correctly) I was finally able to get him on the device this morning and he sent his first text message. I think it is going to be difficult for him at first and he says he is tired (hard to learn new things and he is tending to use his head movements more than his eyes for now) but I'm hopeful this will help him feel more connected.   Funny when I first started on this journey I thought how awful all of these devices were going to be to use and how hard it would be. Yes it's hard but all of the things we've added in have helped my PALS and kept him going. He's been frustrated lately as his speech deteriorates. I can still understand most of what he says but that is diminishing and others have a hard time. I'm so glad we got this device going now.

47055,2020-09-28 00:00:00,If I hate myself how long before he does,I sometimes think I must be the worst person in the world. I get angry at all the changes my house has gone thru (petty) my life has been put on hold ((even more so pettiness). My husband is confined to his chair. He takes 55% of his daily intake thru the tube. He has no use of his hands as they have curled as well as his toes. He’s beginning to struggle speaking and all this happening to the poor man   I feel like I want to scream at him. He was given the tools to record his voice in case this happens. But he didn’t. I tell him to get a hold of his OT or dietitian and he instead plays his game or watches tv. He refuses to do anything for himself. When Covid hit and I was able to stop travelling for my job I became full time caretaker. Starting in April. I’ve had 4 days away since then other then running to grocery stores. I am not one to sit and watch tv all the time. I have a few hobbies that keep me sane however if I try I get the pout from him. So I stop.   I can’t even go to my own room and read a book without hearing about it. I was his everything before he was diagnosed and now.... at first I loved being home and taking care of him. Cooking and making sure he’s comfortable. Taking him for walks playing games..... now I Just want to be done and I hate myself for it.   It’s only been a year a bit since he was diagnosed disease spread so fast that he was in a wheelchair 6 months after diagnosis and the drs say it will continue to do so. And it breaks my heart cause he’s my best friend and i tell him everything but I’m so tired and bored and feel all I do is what he needs me to do and I’m loosing myself so I have this part of me that just wants it to be done.   And before you judge trust me I’ve said everything I’m sure others would love to say to me. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to give him what he needs anymore because Of this numbness I’m feeling. I am on meds for my moods and anxiety but they don’t seem to be doing much.  my question is surely there is someone who has had these feelings. I know I love him but right now I’m so overwhelmed with other feelings I sometimes forget that.  my friends say I need to get out more.... Covid makes it a little hard Winter is going to be worse. I’m used to working 10 hour days and then getting calls all night and days off. Now I don’t take them because i don’t want to enjoy that feeling of being a boss and running things when I am suppose to be here with my husband. I was working at home 4 days A week and then driving 2 hours for 3 days before Covid hit. It was doable and it gave me something just for me. Which allowed me to focus on my husband and still feel somewhat normal.   But since April....... I did all the work we needed to do in the house but now.... and I am tired of the pouting and sighs that I hear from the living room when I want to do something for myself in my room. I can takehim for a 2 hour walk. Sit and chat and the moment I stand up he’s giving me the gears for leaving.  I know I have repeated myself and I’ve rambled and maybe even said something that I didn’t quite explain well enough that someone may just tell me it should have been me. Not him. His compassion for people is mind blowing. Friends families. Strangers. It’s one of the reasons we fell in love. We had planned on doing more as we slowly retire. I thought I was made from stronger cloth and that my empathy for others was strong.   Now I’m wondering if I’ve just always been like this and didn’t Know it. I’ve tried to talk to someone but Covid makes it tricky and I really don’t know if someone Who doesn’t know what I’m going thru can honestly say whether I am truly a selfish and horrible person or someone has a solution on how to get my life on track again.  sorry for the novel and for making u read my ramblings.,False,Blackeyes,2019-07-07 00:00:00,36,CALS,2019-06-01 00:00:00,CA,SK,Swift current,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/if-i-hate-myself-how-long-before-he-does.47055/
47214,2020-10-29 00:00:00,Life post-trach: mental health?,Hi everyone  After an absence for an air ambulance and a return to our home country my wife/PALS has had another few months firstly in hospital and now in a care home. Medically speaking all is stable with the trach in situ and experienced care staff in the home. Despite this my PALS greatest wish (since being hospitalised suddenly in January this year) has been to return home. We are working on that together with home aides and medical staff. In the meantime I have started to notice a real change in mental health. I can’t work out whether this might be social isolation - after 8 months of being allowed no visitors except me (covid...) - we had our first time apart when I had to quarantine and wasn’t allowed into the home. On the other hand it could be medication and/or sleepiness. To me there’s an element of sensory deprivation along with social isolation: curtains usually drawn to enable eye gaze to work (which it barely does); and light fairly constant except for sleeping. My fear though is that this is yet another element of the disease. I’m not sure there are many invasively ventilated patients in general and so the pool of expertise might be limited for this type of musing. But any hints as to what I should look out for; what I might best report to doctors etc would be very helpful indeed.,False,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/life-post-trach-mental-health.47214/

47055,2020-09-28 00:00:00,If I hate myself how long before he does,"OK SK you are not the worst person in the world and no one here will judge you. There is no CALS whose empathy for their PALS does not break down at times and no CALS (or PALS) that doesn't have times of wishing it were over.  He does not hate you you don't hate him.  You might consider a frank discussion with him and perhaps come to a consensus that you can take work calls undertake hobbies or read in your book when he can do without you. If he is being unduly possessive which I would define as saying he needs you when he doesn't that might be because he's missing his own hobbies and pursuits and so part of your agreement might be that you help him find a way to engage with some of those. Is there anything doable that he'd rather do than TV and gaming?  So you're on psychoactive meds -- is he? Does he want to be? It is worth talking about? Have you talked to your prescriber about updating your meds if necessary and/or counseling via telemedicine?  That he has not recorded his voice is not necessarily either depression or inertia -- it's also something you could talk about in the ""can you tell me why"" vein but it's not uncommon and not having a synth voice that sounds somewhat like him vs. a synth that doesn't won't really affect his quality of life so I'm not really sure that's the lead here.  Anyway when you talk about being ""like this"" there's no ""like this."" You're still you in one of the worst possible situations soldiering on by yourself pretty much sounds like.

47055,2020-09-28 00:00:00,If I hate myself how long before he does,"My husband didn't record his voice. I was surprised because he got on renovating the house early in the game--but recording his voice did not happen. He was brilliant with computers but couldn't operate the eye gaze. Eventually his brain gave up on him. FTD can come on very slowly and the early stages can be hard to spot but personality changes are a big hint. He is scared and helpless and you are his lifeline--emotionally and physically. If he's dealing with cognitive changes he may not be able to process your needs.  BTW no judgement here. What you are going through is beyond what most people can possibly imagine. Yes to be honest I did at times feel what you are feeling. I was able to step out of life and dedicate myself to him for which was was grateful and I had a lot of help but I still felt what you are feeling. It's hard to admit but please know that it's not abnormal.  For him this is the rest of his life. He does not have an after ALS to look forward to--at least not in this world. It may seem at times that he retains compassion for everyone but you--please try to see that as a sign of his trust in you. I don't think it's unusual to feel under appreciated when you are your PALS' everything. We expect babies to be completely dependent on us but when the person who is our strength becomes needy it is terrifying.   It sounds like maybe you are punishing yourself when you say about the phone calls ""Now I don’t take them because i don’t want to enjoy that feeling of being a boss and running things when I am suppose to be here with my husband."" There is nothing wrong with feeling good!!! If you can handle the calls from home without neglecting him please don't deny yourself something that makes you feel good!!! Retaining some connection with the outside world will help you return to it one day and it's important that you plan for that day. It does not make you bad or mean that you don't love your husband. It does not mean you want him gone. It means that you respect the future you have left. Think of it as living for him and don't feel guilty about planning for your inevitable while caring for him during his.  You will find yourself. It takes time (I'm almost two years into my recovery after five years with ALS) but it will happen. You will not be the same person; this journey changes us--for the better I believe. You will be stronger and have a changed view of what matters in life and you will be able to create a new life for yourself.

In fact the last week has seen a huge growth in progression and we now use everything to help my husband as he cannot walk toilet or bathe himself. He is on bipap/ventilator about 20 hours a day and without it I can hear him struggle for breath when talking or really doing anything.   It's been such a roller-coaster of emotions that I had a complete meltdown two nights ago and ended up yelling at him for continuing to try and rearrange the sling while he's in it. I start my masters program this weekend and will need to dedicate 4 hours a day each Saturday and Sunday. I'm scared I will not be able to do that and take care of him at the same time.   I'm scared of the future and I grieve for the past we barely had together before he got diagnosed.

47214,2020-10-30 00:00:00,Life post-trach: mental health?,So sorry you are both going through all of this. There are many reports of huge mental health issues for people bed bound and trached. I think that having a trach and vent and being to be out and about in a PWC is a very different thing.  Being bed bound and in a hospital this long surely will take a toll on her mental health.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/life-post-trach-mental-health.47214/
47214,2020-10-30 00:00:00,Life post-trach: mental health?,Agreed I would try to be perhaps a bit more aggressive in getting her outside and in different parts of the center. No one's mind is at its best in the same room 24/7.   And the longer she stays in bed the more her body will rebel against transfers such as to the shower so for me that would be a priority as well. Her body's ability to regulate pulse equilibrium and blood pressure rests on a certain amount of movement even passive transfers. It might be worth even a small dose of a sedative if needed for safety to accelerate that process a learned adaptation sort of like when you first step into a cold pool and then warm up.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/life-post-trach-mental-health.47214/
47214,2020-11-01 00:00:00,Life post-trach: mental health?,Thanks for these suggestions. Apparently the bed in the care home is likely too wide to go down the corridor - or at least to pass through the doors to the garden area. (It’s the only facility in our area that can accommodate someone trached and vented apparently.) I did take on board the comments about staying in bed. After the fuss caused by the rocketing heart rate which resulted from anxiety about a shower I think the better place to start is maybe trying the hoist with a view to sitting in the PWC.  I have also had a good discussion with one of our favourite nurses just about the medication levels. With anti-depressants now having been taken so long there may be a bit of tolerance. The doctor will revisit the medicine levels with a view to making some adjustments. Also this week a UTI seems to have contributed to the element of confusion the other day. It’s a lot to keep track of but I do appreciate the feedback here. I’ve never met anyone else either who has ALS or is looking after someone with it so this forum is extremely helpful!,True,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/life-post-trach-mental-health.47214/
47214,2020-11-02 00:00:00,Life post-trach: mental health?,I feel if you can work towards her being able to get up into a PWC it will make a difference in the long term. It may be worth starting with just trying lifting her in the hoist to a sitting type position for a little while then lowering her to the bed and increasing to how she tolerates things. Antidepressant review - again this is a good thing to do. Her situation is complex and so working on multiple fronts may well be needed as there could be more than one issue at play.  And finally a UTI really does mess with the head. I remember having one a very long time ago but I still remember the slightly delirious state I was in in a weird 'watching from the outside' way.  Sometimes just laying the issues out here can bring clarity to what might be tried let alone the breadth of suggestions you might get in return. So glad you have some things to work on.

47453,2020-12-06 00:00:00,New to ALS and this forum,Hello everyone. I just found this forum and it's a relief to see so many of you out there. But I am sorry there are so many of us out there.  My husband was diagnosed with ALS in May 2020 at age 61. He ran a marathon in October 2019 and another in December 2019. Watching the steady march of this horrific disease is devastating. And I know you all know of what I speak. We work hard to live in the moment and find joy in simple pleasures every single day. And there is a lot to be grateful for. AND I also feel overwhelmed under the crush of grief and physical strain as I am also continuing to work my paid job. We are currently in Tucson and have begun care with Dr. Ladha at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. Dr. Ladha and his team are outstanding. The local ALS Association chapter is amazing too.   I am trying to stay ahead of everything so we aren't always reacting to crises especially since it appears that we are not among the people whose disease progresses slowly. He takes Riluzole and Baclofen. We're waiting to find an infusion center nearby for Radicava. My husband has had several terrible falls and uses a walker now. His speech swallowing and mobility are all severely affected. He has done the voice bank and we have an iPad with stylus to use as a boogie board (is this the right term?) I'm making smoothies and cooking softer foods we have ramps in/out of the house and will have the ADA accessible bathroom done this week. But I am lifting him in and out of chairs helping him in and out of bed helping him roll over in bed. We have a Prius which is a mobility nightmare. He's tall and lean (runner's body) and I have strained my back shoulders right arm and hips with all the lifting and moving.   Thank you for letting me tell you all this. But also as the people who are living this now can you please tell me what I need to know? What's your best advice? What equipment do you consider essential? How do you even begin to find household assistance? And especially with the very real life-threatening threat of Covid-19. What are your go-to recipes for smoothies or meals that provide good nutrition taste good and help keep your PALS' weight up? How do you stay upbeat and cheerful while you are watching your beloved be ravaged by ALS?   Thank you.,False,lindyazmn,2020-12-06 00:00:00,10,Lost a loved one,2020-05-01 00:00:00,US,AZ,Tucson,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/new-to-als-and-this-forum.47453/
47055,2020-09-30 00:00:00,If I hate myself how long before he does,"Dear Blackeyes  First of all there is no judgment here. You are welcome to come and vent.   ALS is a terrible beast and COVID-19 has not made the situation better. All of the things that counselors tell us to do are off limits now - get together with friends do activities for yourself take care of yourself. I used to occasionally get a massage...no more. I used to go out for a ride with friends and get together for lunch. No more.   Is there a way you can get help? We are fortunate to be in a position to be able to hire a caregiver during the week. I know I do not have control over where she goes when she isn't here but I am hopeful that she is being careful. It allows me to continue to work (part time) pursue some of the things that feed my heart and get some exercise. My PALS has been very supportive of my doing this.  It is still a heartbreaking disease. We have been living with ALS for going on 5 years now. I've seen people that I started with on the forum come and go as our ordeal continues. My PALS is confined to wheelchair/bed cannot feed or toilet himself is on bipap 24/7 and can no longer feed himself and is having difficulty eating. Worse he cannot pursue any of the things he previously enjoyed. I have had numerous meltdowns in the course of caregiving and felt like I too was the worst person in the world. I finally sat down with my husband and told him that I love him but I hate ALS and I'm very angry with ALS for making us both be like this so when I get angry it's with ALS and not with him. He understood completely. He is angry with ALS too.   ALS often brings me to tears as well. I cannot imagine how frightening it must be to be inside his failing body. He is sad and frustrated lately as his speech is starting to fail him and he is often exhausted. I have been trying to take him on an outing somewhere every week if possible but at times it tires him out more. At any rate I think I have reached the ""Acceptance"" phase; things that I could not have imagined seem normal to me now   Any time you need to vent we are here.

I wish we hadn’t worked so hard the last few years so we could pay everything off and then slow down putting off holidays and things we took for granted would still be there in our 5 year plan. I wish everyday didn’t start with a prayer hoping today was going to be a good day for him. I wish my nights weren’t full of tears and hopelessness.

I wish I didn’t feel so much anger at a god who would take away someone who gave so much of himself to everyone who knows him while pedophiles and murders fill our jails.

My son (32) works a lot so can't come as much but he does whenever he can. It takes l all of us to care for him. My husband was diagnosed in 2016 I look back year to year and see the decline. He is on hospice now. I haven't been back to work since September so I can take care of him. I have aides during the days but not at night. Even with aides it takes at least 2 people to manage some tasks. Bathing getting into and out of the wheelchair. Many meds to keep track of. Timesheets and aides to keep track of. I haven't had a good night sleep in months. I sleep on the couch so I am close to his room which was the garage. I'm afraid if I go upstairs I won't hear him. I get very frustrated with all his needs and getting him ""just right"" with his arms in place his legs the computer in the right spot his towel between his legs his sheet with hands out etc. I could spend over a half hour just putting him to bed. Then he rolls his eyes when I say I'm going to lunch with a friend and tries to make me feel guilty. What a mess!! Not being able to understand a word he says and being trapped in his body is horrific. I miss my life and the life we had planned.

47214,2020-11-05 00:00:00,Life post-trach: mental health?,Just a quick interim update to say that with the help of a specialist ALS nurse (a valuable resource here) I’ve managed to line up some new things. Firstly just moving my wife’s bed to face different things and possibly taking her in it down the hall and to the residents’ lounge for a change of scenery. Then we can move to hoist and possibly PWC. The meds review is underway and will hopefully slightly reduce laxatives - doctors have been overly keen on pumping those in in my opinion and that of some of the nurses - and revisit depression meds too.

It's encouraging to hear that things are moving along in a way that may allow you to get her home...assuming you can work out the caregiving support piece.  Still could you fill me in a little more on the Eye-Gaze situation? Before my wife was able to get a single unit Tobii Dynavox I-12 loaner from our ALS Center and then get an actual one of her own I set up the tobii eye tracker bar thing you seem to be using on a dedicated laptop I bought her. No matter what I did I couldn't get that thing to work anywhere near adequately. It was just a constant frustration. I haven't been following other posts of yours of late so I am wondering if you have any kind of ALS Center/or disability Center there in Edinburgh that could provide an Tobii I-series loaner with stand? Or could you get one through insurance or find one used somewhere? I really think that until you get your hands on a Tobii or a similar self-contained eye-gaze unit your wife will continue to have trouble communicating.  Also could you explain to me how she communicates her needs to you without an eye-gaze? Just yes-no questions with blinks? Other?

For one thing in addition to the standard neck and wrist pendants which became too hard to press Bay Alarm offers a sticky button that can be mounted on a wall or other surface. Surprisingly not all companies have this option. I have one stuck to my wheelchair that I can activate with my foot and one stuck to a paper plate that is put next to my feet at night. The button is larger and more sensitive so easy to activate.  I have it set up to notify four nearby friends and caregivers . If the first person doesn't answer it will ring the second. If none of the four answer it will call ems. I can't speak so this happens automatically though their dispatch center calls on the base station every time and quickly runs through a series of questions that I ignore. . If someone is here they can say ""call ems"" or that the button was pushed in error and they cancel the sequence. Any errors have been on our end not theirs.

If you are going to self fund a wheelchair be sure to consider buying a used one. For example I purchased a new Permobil F5 out of pocket for $25000. A good used one goes for about $5000. I have paid as little as $800 and as much as $4000 for used wheelchairs. I have had to put an additional $1000 to $1500 into each of those wheelchairs to make them fit me correctly.  I have found that working with Durable Medical Equipment (DME) companies such as NuMotion can be quite the headache. Find a DME that accepts your insurance. Once you have done that I encourage you to work within that DME to find someone good to work with.

47453,2020-12-06 00:00:00,New to ALS and this forum,"As Al says sorry you have had to join our ranks Lindy.  My first advice is get a Hoyer lift (that's a generic term not just a brand) and a hospital bed if you don't have one. Medicare covers only a manual (non-powered) lift but you need a powered one. Your local ALSA chapter may have a loaner. but they are also available for cash on line at sites such as SpinLife. The chapter may also have resources to speed up the hospital bed process which does require a doctor's order.  We have a number of threads about soft food/smoothies/high-speed blending [the search link is top right] but if his swallowing ultimately isn't going to support those it may be time to discuss a feeding tube placement.  If he seems unsteady even with the walker it would be time to get the power wheelchair process started at clinic since it doesn't happen overnight.  In that scenario a Prius will have to give way to a wheelchair-accessible van unless you are able to use public transportation or require less frequent driving-length trips (vans can also be rented by the day) so that might be a process to start thinking about also.  ""Steady march"" is the right phrase unfortunately. It is a lot to take in. So I'll just raise one other thing for now -- how is his breathing? When it needs support he will need a BiPAP.

47453,2020-12-06 00:00:00,New to ALS and this forum,"Thank you Laurie and Al!   Yes it is all very overwhelming. We lived in Minneapolis MN until moving to Tucson in October. My husband received the first preliminary diagnosis in April at Noran Clinic and then a second opinion/confirmation in May from Dr. Manousakis at the U of MN (because of Covid I was not allowed in the building and sat in the parking lot and listened to the diagnosis over speaker phone...). We thought we might just be in Tucson for the winter to escape snow and ice but honestly I don't think my husband will ever be able to leave AZ. It's just moving so fast. Transitioning care to Barrow Neurological is great but I feel like we lost some ground between the baselines in MN and establishing the more recent ""baselines"" in AZ. I'm still catching my breath and on a crash course with all the medical terms and testing numbers. Between May and August I know he went from 80% to 72% breathing capacity. I'm sure it's way lower now.   So thank you for the advice. This is exactly what I was hoping to find out. I figured we needed the Hoyer lift hospital bed and power wheelchair at some point. But I think I've naively been hoping for one of those plateaus. And also naively thinking that ""if I just XYZ [figure out the right food or grip his arm more tightly or etc. etc.] then everything will be ok""... While I love the Prius's gas mileage the effort required to get out the door and in the car is daunting. I'm not sure if it's worth buying an accessible van if we'd only need it for months rather than years so I'm glad to know it's possible to rent a van. And better to have a feeding tube than aspirating food. So I appreciate the reality check and straight talk.

It is being a little masked by the O2 he is receiving.  Aspiration pneumonia was a big turning point for my husband and he declined fast from that point.   Other PALS rally and go on for a year or years after a severe pneumonia.  I would hazard a guess however that not eating for 5 days receiving O2 and the symptoms of CO2 build up are possibly painting a picture that suggests things are on a steep decline.   I kind of feel now in my gut that continuing with the O2 is the kindest thing for him and give good palliative care to him with much love.

40910,2018-04-27 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Well it's been what about six weeks and we're preparing to leave the hospital again. Matt came down with a virus that lead to pnuemonia and then his belly and colon filled us with gas and wouldn't give it up. We came in Monday night and were released at 10 this morning. It's now 5:15 pm and we're still waiting on transportation. He wanted me to drive him home by myself but we're past that point.  So here's a crazy story. There is one other gentleman in our small community with ALS. We first met he and his wife in the grocery store--there's no mistaking the chair setup. He was already trached and vented but we had a long and animated visit right there in the meat department. Well it turns out they were in the room next to us all week and we didn't know it until today. There are only 8 beds in this ICU but we had the curtains drawn a lot and we just never ran into each other!,True,Nuts,2014-02-23 00:00:00,2576,Lost a loved one,2014-01-01 00:00:00,US,NC,Littleton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/venting-tomorrow-which-will-surely-cause-more-venting.40910/page-5

40910,2018-05-16 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"Wish you are so funny! Actually one of the the things I play with in the back of my mind is turning this house into an accessible B&amp;B (there aren't any others that I know of on this lake).  So since my last post we've done one ER run and were sent him and a second run to another hospital where he was admitted for three days. Ileus again. This time gastro got involved and said that they believe his problem is an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine creating all the gas. His diabetes the ALS and milk based formula set him up for it and they suspect repeated rounds of antibiotics will be the answer because it's just going to keep happening.  Between that and his blood sugar I ordered two cases of Liquid Hope to try it out. If it resolves some of his issues I'll launch the battle to get insurance or the VA to cover it. It is thick so we mixed in 100ml of water and it runs just fine through his pump.  The last hospital run was scary. He filled with so much gas that we couldn't get anything in or out of his stomach--to include his medications. It took a day and a half to get him to the point that we could get meds in and by then he was a wreck--questioning his decision to have the trach and wanting to know about turning it off. After a couple of days back on those chemical wonder drugs he's back to happy Matt.  Talk about being blessed the nursing agency sent nurses to sit with him in the hospital!!! I was able to leave because I trust both of the nurses completely. It was very strange not being there with him but at this point they actually kept a closer eye on things than I was able to. It was also very very strange to come home to an empty house.   We took Matt for a haircut yesterday and then he wanted to go to Lowes to pick out new kitchen appliances.That is the most active he's been since the trach went in. I think it also helps that both daughters have called to discuss life altering decisions they are in the process of making (he can talk with the inline Passy-Muir valve). Pete's post really drove home how important it is for our PALS to realize that they do contribute to our lives even if their bodies have betrayed them.   Oh back to the hospital stay. I know Im jumping around. It's interesting to watch the varying reactions by the staff to having a private duty nurse show up. Most are grateful for the help. One had a bad attitude all day and I finally had to chew her up a bit. That's always dangerous because I'm never sure that once I start I won't take out all my pain and anger and frustration on that person but I was able to restrict myself to her attitude. Happily she came around when she saw us cleaning Matt up after a BM. I guess she realized that we weren't just there to give her instructions... By the time we left everyone was very friendly which is the best outcome.   I've also added yet another item to the ""go list"". The portable Hoyer will now remain in the van. we simply could not get them to bring in the Hoyer to lift Matt for a BM. They didn't think their slings would work and their lifts only work with their paper slings. ARGH. He wouldn't go home without a BM and he can't have one on his back. In desperation we finally rolled him on his side. It worked but his O2 dropped to the 70s in just s few moments. We rolled him right over on his back and sat him up and told him that the rest if there was more would wait until we got home. I actually had visions fo him exploding all over the room as we picked him up to transfer to the chair (oh yeah my nurse pointed out to their nurse that his butt was showing through the sling and told her to never let anyone tell her again that it couldn't be done). Well we got home with no incidents.  Sue you were right. I now drive him by myself vent and all. I no longer care--I'll stop anywhere that I have to if he needs something. I just keep an eye on him through the mirror. The ambulance ride was way too rough on him!!

She seems to be tolerating the feeding tube well so far.   The biggest change I’ve noticed is since she started taking Nuedexta. She is bulbar onset and she has had noticeable improvement in her speech and saliva since she started taking it. We noticed a difference after only two days!

43866,2019-03-08 00:00:00,"""Important information"" template?",Hi all I was wondering if anyone has a document/binder to share where all the important information one should know about one's pALS is in one place (contact info for doctors nurses etc.; medication list; etc.)   I know we should probably have compiled such a thing already given that my husband was diagnosed more than two years ago and is quite advanced but since I am home we've never really had a need for it. However I am going away for the first time in a year...just an overnight for a college friend's milestone birthday. I know it will be good for me to get away and he should be fine but I'm a bit wary to leave and realize that having this information handy would be at least a starting point to put my mind at ease.   We have a live-in 24/7 PCA/caregiver who will be here. He is absolutely amazing and takes care of all of my husband's care however he has some limitations...like for example we kinda don't think he can read (I know I know but he makes up for it in so many other ways). My kids (15 and 18) will be around and friends will be visiting over the weekend so they would be able to help our PCA with any reading or needing to contact anyone should the need arise.  So if any of you more organized people have such a document already that I could use as a starting point it would be immensely appreciated.

44111,2019-04-28 00:00:00,Repeated denials for in home services,We had to get on hospice to basically have any coverage and the only aide that Medicare paid for was three times per week with the bath aide so total hours. They paid for brief hospice nurse visits and hospice made it pretty clear I needed to do everything but change out the catheter monthly because aides were not allowed to do much ch and nursing would be very limited time wise.  I paid for around 30 hours a week so I could smash that together with the six bath hours weekly and I did all morning and evening cares plus all weekend. Brian thanks to some heavy technology and a few extra gizmos and having a voice to command with could be alone a few hours though I hated that. I used both private staff and agency aides for the care hours.   I’m sorry this homecare situation stinks.

Got lights out at 10:30 that was good. Woke about 12:30 to a louder noise thru the monitor so off I went to check on him. Here his feeding pump was beeping and I was not hearing that thru the monitor. I asked him if it just started and he said no. I asked if it was beeping the whole time and he said yes. Not good. I don't know why the monitor didn't pick it up. So then I could not sleep right the rest of the night. I was restless and kept waking up. I had turned the monitor up a bit but that was defeating the purpose. I'm going to have to do some testing today and see if I can figure that out.

What kind of mattress is it?   Hospital beds allow for ""tilt"" and ""recline"" in a sense that non-hospital beds don't. Without seeing his setup it's hard to judge. Can he specify what makes him like the recliner more? For instance he might need more padding or postural support for certain joints (knees hips elbows...)  What I've gathered here is that most PALS sleep in a hospital bed but a few prefer the recliner. I would be most worried about pressure injury in the recliner due to heat/moisture buildup and less pressure relief so if you can check those off I wouldn't have as many reservations about that choice.",True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/sleeping-question.47092/

47092,2020-10-19 00:00:00,Sleeping question,"My PALS really loved his recliner for sleeping and then in the end he switched to the wheel chair. Every evening after moving him w. the hoyer he sat in the recliner he had this huge smile on his face. I still have the pictures    It gave him more support on the side(s) than a bed when his body would not hold him up any longer (also sideways) and the right side was weaker than the left. Friends had made him extra pillows for the recliner so it was kind of a custom fit.  BTW he did NOT want to use a hospital bed - never tried - and the day the hospice nurse would have put him in it for a procedure he decided he had had enough and left us.   I also want to say that towards the end we kept on looking for things that would make him more comfortable and that would give him relief - I particularly remember trying to find ways so that his head would be supported while he wanted to sit relatively upright... (bc of breathing and eye gaze) but in the last stretch there were increasingly less ""fixes"" no matter how hard we tried.

Driving alone is never the best situation but definitely doable and done by me many time. Not now however. Things change but use every single moment you can while you can.

Although my Dave is not on an invasive vent I drive him everywhere alone. We just got back from a trip to MD. It was our 37th wedding anniversary so we went to Baltimor Inner Harbor for 2 nights then on to Ocean City MD for 4 nights. It is a LOT of work .......... and involves  many  trips from the van to the hotel room (complete with stares while people watch me push the shower/toilet chair portable Hoyer etc. into the elevator. Pretty funny actually!). But we have always enjoyed traveling and will continue to do so as long as it is still feasible. It was 6 days of no grocery shopping no cooking cleaning etc. for me so a bit of a respite for me as well.  I'm glad your nurse pointed out to the hospital nurse that YES toileting can be done via transfer (or even hovering if need be) utilizing a ""U"" shaped swing! YEESH!! I'm sorry you had to deal with that lack of knowledge and now have to consider taking your own Hoyer due to ignorance!  I too can imagine you running an accessible Airbnb experience.

47424,2020-11-30 00:00:00,Advice needed,I can see this frustration happening between my caregivers and me also. It feels like burnout.

You need help now though don't delay starting this as any help won't give immediate changes for you but there is help available. I don't know what the answer is but it could be a mix of support/counselling medications moving to hospice more help in the home exercise meditation respite. Not necessarily all of them. What I mean is that there are many ways you could possibly be supported better so start now.  What you are doing is a huge thing and feeling overwhelmed is completely understandable and a natural response. You need more help either with looking after your husband or looking after yourself.

47424,2020-11-30 00:00:00,Advice needed,Dear Crystal I hear you. We just passed the 5 year mark. My PALS function is pretty limited now. It is overwhelming to take care of someone who can do so little for himself. Add in all of the other things that need attention (eyegaze system hoyer lift hospital bed bipap non verbal communication) and it can seem like there is no way to handle things.  I dont know exactly what your situation is but I have to break things down into small tasks. We CALS can only do one thing at a time. Are you getting enough sleep? Do you need more help? Does your PALS need hospice now?  I also have a caregiver who works days. I occasionally have meltdowns too. Over the weekend both sides of the split king hospital bed quit working the eyegaze system made my PALS frustrated and angry and the bipap mask ripped. It's frustrating and difficult every day. Covid19 makes it harder for us to do the things that keep us healthy. Just know that you are not alone. We are here and we understand.

47424,2020-11-30 00:00:00,Advice needed,Dang Crystal at 3 1/2 years into this ALS thing I'd be worried about you if your weren't irrational and emotional. I'm pretty sure I hit that milepost a bit earlier than you. Like Nona says the CALS support groups are a great thing...but that is more challenging now with Covid. Still worth seeing what your ALS Center has going on support-wise for sure. Tillie offered great ideas. Personally I found exercise and fresh air crucial. Continuing to get out for my run even if only once or twice a week was vitally important. Enjoying fresh air and nature was very therapeutic for both of us during our journey. That being said I recognize how hard that can be for many PALS/CALS. I was never able to find anyone to really consistently commiserate with but I didn't mind that much since I still had my wife and we were tight...even though it was never easy. I know the innate loneliness of this is really hard for all involved. I hope you can find a way to connect with people who can support you and reenergize you. Hang in there and try best you can to not let the perception of others get you down. You're clearly amazing and you can do it....Jon,True,jonico,2017-02-21 00:00:00,157,Lost a loved one,2014-12-01 00:00:00,US,NY,Central,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/advice-needed.47424/
47424,2020-12-01 00:00:00,Advice needed,Crystal - was he always this way or has he experienced behavioural changes making him so lacking in empathy and refusing equipment that would improve his quality of life? I'm afraid you may have to really make some hard decisions about how long your part in this can go on. Him expecting you to physically support him instead of equipment is dangerous. What if you both fall and you are injured? How will he be cared for then?  I went through many of the things you are describing. Please start getting some help so you can develop some strategies. I truly know that this situation is far from easy especially when he is not truly being rational yet accusing that you are not.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/advice-needed.47424/
47424,2020-12-01 00:00:00,Advice needed,Crystal your reluctance to physically support and transfer him sounds pretty darn rational to me. My guess is that he is bigger than you. As Tillie says what happens if you fall and are injured?  Are you being seen at an ALS clinic? I have found that if I suggest things my PALS doesn't listen as much as he does when they suggest things. They have also been helpful to me in dealing with my husband's denial which sounds like you may be dealing with as well. I find having a 3rd party with some perceived authority helps. They will tell him you need a hoyer lift and your local ALSA should be able to help with that.  Hope you can get some help here so it's a little less overwhelming.   V,True,vltsra,2015-11-12 00:00:00,580,CALS,2015-11-01 00:00:00,US,CA,San Diego,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/advice-needed.47424/
47424,2020-12-01 00:00:00,Advice needed,V and everyone has great points Crystal. The goal is either for you to break through with your husband in communication -- having an honest conversation about what could work and why this doesn't -- or for a third party to do so. If there is no one who can support you at the clinic try at the ALSA or at your own physician's clinic or someone s/he recommends. It's not that uncommon a situation but it's dangerous for you and him.  Anger and unwillingness to make equipment concessions to the disease can be fear and/or depression in disguise. If you think this is part of the issue some CALS have asked their PALS to try antidepressants (or clinical team members have suggested it) and if that is refused even to place them in food or formula unbidden. Others have asked friends family clergy counselors etc. that the PALS trusts to intervene. Having a plan ABCD in these scenarios can help you get unstuck.

As to washing his back tilting him forward is harder than pushing him on his side. You literally have to pick his back up off of the bed and that is worse ergonomically than pushing him over. I used to do it that way years ago but that became too hard on both of us. Everything has to be done in the bed   Tillie he gets fed 24/7 because he can't tolerate large amounts of food anymore.

You could even try cutting it down to there a little slower 18/24 if you are not going to get into that other room for a full 8 hours anyway. I think that whatever you can try is worth trying!

43198,2018-12-14 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,"Here are some of my suggestions:  First - while you definitely need to tell them don't feel rushed to do so.  We were in your shoes exactly 2 years ago and felt exactly the same way - we have to tell the kids but how can we possibly tell do so? We ended up waiting almost one month until MLK weekend (mid-January). The waiting was agonizing and I am not saying to wait that long (it made sense for us for a variety of personal and professional reasons based on the way we ""rolled out our communication plan"") but my point is although you and your husband know and you have this huge weight on you your kids and everyone else is blissfully unaware. So take the time...take it to figure things out and sort them through. Let your kids enjoy one more holiday season without this marking it.  Second - For what to say I cannot stress enough - speak to Paula Rauch/PACT.  (or if unable read through relevant sections her book). You will get a ton of answers about how to approach this. My mind is a sieve and I forget specific details but some of the main points you will want to make to your kids (and anyone else you tell) are:  We have difficult news to share... - as you may have noticed dad has been experiencing some (explain symptoms)  Give Diagnosis   (Also especially when telling others if the diagnosis is definitive BE SURE TO state that (cannot tell you how many people challenge that even medical personnel we have seen recently. ""I know someone who had X are you sure its not that?"" ""you know lyme disease...."". So nip it in the bud so you don't have to say YES WE ARE FREAKING SURE THANK YOU)​  Explain what this means - while the diagnosis is certain the prognosis /course of the disease is not and no two patients are the same - Be honest - life-ending; no cure  Provide hope (but avoid false promises) - will be getting best medical care - it is a progressive disease so nothing is happening immediately but should enjoy and appreciate our time together that much more  What can they do/How can they help - for our kids - told them we are going to try to enjoy life together to the fullest and not take things for granted - for friends with same-aged kids give them guidance on what to tell their kids (you can be honest and say you are trying to figure it all out yourself) and how to interact with yours (we said treat them as they always have and provide love and support). - if you are setting up some sort of support site (like lotsahelpinghands or meal train include that information); consider designating one friend/family member to manage this to take off your plate.  We used the same basic outline for all our communications just tailored it based on the audience.

We apologize for the impersonal email and hate to be delivering this news this way (or any way at all). However we felt this was the most effective way to do so. We will have inadvertently left people off this original email but please do not take it as any sign other than that we are not quite 100% at the moment.  As some of you may know. He has been experiencing a constellation of odd health symptoms over the past few months. It started with asthma-like symptoms for which he has been taking meds and to which those symptoms seem to be responding. However in addition to those symptoms over the past two months others have emerged including muscle weakness fatigue voice weakness and slurring. He/we have gone to a variety of different doctors/specialists to try to get to the bottom of what is going on. We consider ourselves lucky that we live in a place with world leading medical institutions and access the best specialists in the Boston hospital networks.  We didn’t tell you sooner since we wanted clear clinical confirmation time to gather as much information as possible and time to process it ourselves and share it with immediate family who we just told last week.  The diagnosis originally made at The Brigham and then confirmed at MGH is definitive; He has ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or “Lou Gehrig’s disease”).   While the diagnosis is certain the prognosis is not. One can go to the ALS website or google search and find all kinds of statistics. Science and statistics are averages so they can tell us about everyone but not about any one specific person. Nobody can tell us how fast or slow it will progress but we are hopeful that he has the slow-progressing variety.  ALS is not a good diagnosis. There are significant inroads being made in research and there is much better understanding of the disease than there once was. There are cases where the progression stops….or slows. But it does not reverse. At this time there is no cure and the treatments out there are marginally effective…extending life or quality of life by several months. He is receiving care at Mass General’s ALS clinic the largest and most comprehensive and inter-disciplinary ALS treatment center in the world.  His presentation of symptoms is somewhat less common… many patients exhibit initial symptoms in their lower extremities and the disease then progresses to involve upper extremities. His course is different with his vocal chords and speech being most noticeably affected. His legs / lower extremities have been spared so far but he has lost strength and some functionality of his arms / hands especially his left.   He is still working and intends to continue to do so.  One of the mottos/values from our girls’ summer camp that we certainly embrace is PACE (Positive Attitude Changes Everything). We are strong believers in this. Despite the gravity of this diagnosis we feel that a positive attitude to make the best of a bad situation is the best approach. Some of the things that we are hopeful or feel lucky about are that:   Research will slow / stop the progression of his disease  He is receiving the best care by world-class doctors and leading research here in Boston  We are surrounded by loving friends and family who provide us with unending support through this difficult time for us and especially for our children . There are sure to be times where we want to be surrounded by all of you but there will also be times where we may retreat and just need time by ourselves. Please understand this.  We still need time to process this as a family. For now we are trying to maintain as normal a routine as possible. For our girls especially a positive mindset will be extremely important so rather than sympathy we ask that you and/or your children treat them as they always have and to provide ongoing friendship support and encouragement.   And if you know anything about us you understand that he does not respond well to pity but he can certainly use your positive thoughts and love. Given his fatigue and difficulty speaking phone calls and visits are hard but we welcome your e-mails and texts….just be patient with us if we are slow to respond. At some point in the future we will need more help and when we reach those stages we’ll let you know.  ​  Also once you tell your kids (and friends and family) you probably want to let their schools know (guidance counselors maybe teachers so they are aware and can flag any changes in behavior),True,Turtals,2018-12-11 00:00:00,18,CALS,2016-12-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Newton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/just-found-out-please-help.43198/page-4
43198,2018-12-15 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,Turtals I really appreciate both posts thank you for sharing.  What stood out a lot to me because of experiences we had was -  the diagnosis is definitive .  Would you believe only 1 week ago I had a person stand and try to tell me that doctors don't have a clue and my husband in fact had a problem with electro-magnetic radiation exposure that is killing everyone. This was within 15 minutes of meeting this person he never met my husband and yeah ok he was a bit of a um I have lots of aussie slang words spring to mind ...  But it was just horrible - even 4.5 years after my husbands death to have someone start to second guess and tell me this! And I remembered all the crap of diets and vitamins and lyme and on it went.   So yes once you tell people be very definitive as it is just awful when you find yourself suddenly faced with so many scenarios.  Not likely to happen when you tell your children but you do need to protect them from people laying weird ideas on them too. So the clearer you can find the way to be with your kids the kinder you are being to them as kids actually like facts and clarity even when it's hard stuff.  I also like to remember that there is only one way out of this life. It is not like everyone else will live forever and that can be important to discuss with children.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/just-found-out-please-help.43198/page-4
43198,2018-12-15 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,Turtals - wow thank you so much. All of that is incredible and that email is so helpful.   I should have corrected the info that we don’t have to wait until January anymore. We are now going this Tuesday to MGH. We are relieved about that. And as it turns out Paula from the PACT program is going to be there showdowing the ALS clinic so we will be sitting with her for a bit. I also spoke with Jen about it earlier this week too.   I would like to say that I cannot believe that anyone would challenge or doubt an ALS diagnosis after you tell them. I’m sure we will face that too. Some people say *stupid* things out of kindness and some people are just stupid. This diagnosis sure clarified the fact that suffering fools is not worth the time and effort. Sorry you guys have/had to deal with that. Geesh.   My husband and I feel that we need to tell our kids soon for a variety of reasons.  1) it is getting hard to hide it and we need them to trust us going forward.  2) we understand that the holidays are a protected time for kids - they will be surrounded by close family and our closest friends most of whom know what’s going on. The period after the holidays is a let down for kids and not an emotionally protected time so while we thought about waiting it feels right to tell them before.... 3)thinking being that the traditions and the normalcy of our holidays should provide some comfort to them as it will reinforce that life is “normal” AAr least for right now and that we are living our lives together. Nothing is drastically changing right now. We hope that provides a level of comfort.  4) It’s difficult to have only the necessary people know to get the logistical help (rides etc) time off work for appointments etc and emotional support from a few close people without being dishonest and deceptive to the kids especially the 15 yo. He knows something it up even though he acts like he doesn’t. I’m also getting increasingly nervous that the kids are going to hear something accidentally and then that trust is damaged too.   This is the current plan: We are going to tell them we are going to Boston on Tues to meet with specialists about what has been going on with dad’s walking and after several months of tests etc. we should have news to share with them Wednesday. And then we will tell them separately in an age appropriate way. This advice was given to us by MGH because then the kids will feel like they got the diagnosis “with us” and we will start this path together as a family. I feel that I can deliver this news in a calm controlled way and so does my husband. My heart is breaking of course but my resolve to model how we will face this diagnosis is strong for my boys. I am determined to show them we are handling it and that they will be cared for and supported by us.   Then I can have some time (and lots of wine) when school is out to slowly let teachers coaches and our friends know. And we will live on and do what we need to do to emotionally support them while giving my husband the care he needs.   I know this is not the right way for others but it feels right to me and my husband today. I do worry about “ruining Christmas” but the thought that life (even Xmas) will go on as planned for at least a little while feels right. I don’t know it’s a tough call. None of us should ever be in this situation but we are. And we walk through the fear and sadness until we find a spark of joy. And then we and carry on.

44845,2019-07-29 00:00:00,Worried for My Mom,Hi everyone!   I’m new here and joined because I have some questions about my mom’s progression. I am a college student in the uk and am only back in the us during breaks. My mom has progressed very rapidly while I was at school and I am wondering how much time we realistically have left.   She can move her toes and her head a little though is rapidly losing the ability to keep her head up. Sometimes she can move an arm or a leg an inch or two but it takes a lot of effort. She is on something similar to a cpap machine every night. Her oxygen levels are in the mid-eighties during the day but lung assessments in her power chair say she is below half lung function. She recently started taking a calorie supplement through her feeding tube eats very little and chokes on most of her meals. I know she needs more professional care than she is currently receiving but my father refuses to pay for it so I fear she may be getting worse from lack of adequate help. My mom has been voicing her fear over leaving my sister and I alone with our abusive father much more frequently which makes me think she too is concerned about her time left.  I am worried we are nearing the end and was wondering if anyone with a similar progression (we are just over two years in) could offer advice.

I remember every detail of my husband's diagnosis a few months before he turned 45. It was days and nights of crying and feeling as if we were in a bad dream. I thought to myself ""look at all these people walking around going about their everyday life. How can this be possible when our world has been so turned upside down?"". But as someone with sage advice gave me (on this forum of course) ""This may be a strange and scary new world for you but it is a new world that you will for the most part get used to"". And he was right; while it sucks and there are so many tears still it has become our new norm and we have met many wonderful people as a result.   As for how we told people except for everyone outside our closest friends and immediate family which we told in person we did what Turtal did but posted our message on Facebook. Some people never talked to us again and others have become so close we now consider them family. We count ourselves to be very blessed with these new ""family""  members.

44845,2019-07-29 00:00:00,Worried for My Mom,Hi Grace  If your mom's O2 level is only in the mid-80s she is not doing well. I wonder if she is on the right kind of machine (it should be a BiPAP) and how well it is adjusted for her. How recently has someone evaluated this?  If she chokes while eating I cannot think why she would not be getting nutrition full-time using the tube instead? Choking puts her at risk for pneumonia or an obstruction either of which can be fatal.   If your father is abusive and he is in charge of your mom's care you your sister and your mom are best equipped to judge how and when to bring this up to your mom's clinic (even virtually) some other local authority or someone in her inner circle other than your dad if there is a way for something to change and for her to receive better care. I would like to believe better care is possible for her but do you?  Separately you and your sister may wish to consider planning now for what happens when your mom gets worse/can no longer communicate and after she dies if there are things you can do now to protect her and your wellbeing and any tangible assets. An attorney may have some thoughts.  If your mom is not getting enough breathing help and nutrition (as it sounds) then she is hanging on through determination and that could end at any time. If there is something she is still hoping to do experience or know try not to delay.

44845,2019-07-29 00:00:00,Worried for My Mom,Hi Grace welcome here. Nobody knows but if your mom eats very little and does not take in enough calories her ALS will speed up. My partner and I had many conversations about whether it was more desirable for him to reach end of life sooner rather than later. He opted for sooner and I told him that I would support him. I would have supported a different decision on his part too. He did not want to drag out the end phase too long.   If your mother's breathing is as you describe I believe she would qualify for hospice. And then you would not pay caregivers. You need to be a bit careful if hospice will allow the breathing equipment. Some will especially for ALS patients. Our intake nurse made sure we would get all the equipment needed before we signed on. This included trilogy cough assist and suction machine for us. They would have given us a hospital bed and a hoyer lift had we needed one and probably some toilet chair too.   Our palliative care physician knew our hospice service rather well and we kept that same physician through the hospice time. I thought that was helpful.   Much luck. I hope that your mother will get good care.,True,ReginaS,2018-11-20 00:00:00,211,Lost a loved one,2018-02-01 00:00:00,US,VA,--,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/worried-for-my-mom.44845/

My mom has been taking CBD oil and she has no pain and she lifts her neck and is able to function. CBD oil was not available at the time my dad had ALS. My mom takes 1 drop at a time and she can lift her neck and walk more than she was without it.   CBD oil is huge in the US. It helps with anyone with pain. It was recommended to my mom to get the THC (which is marijuina) which I am skeptical about but it calms the nerves which are in overdrive with ALS. I cannot condone this but if it helps with quality of living for my mom..it is up to her. Being that I went through this with my dad there has been NO PROGRESS with ALS. My dad passed in 2011.

43793,2019-03-02 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,"My husband was diagnosed two years before yours in December 2016 (and we also have teens). He kept working (and driving) until the summer but with gradually reduced hours. His was bulbar onset which was particularly hard for him given that most of what he did at work was meeting/talking with others. The speech therapist told us to think of having a jar/bank each day - it starts out full but as you go through the day it gets depleted.   So your observation that it seems he has to plan and ""save up"" his energy to do the things he wants to do is spot on.   For my pALS this meant that he made sure to schedule any calls/meetings in the am when he (and his voice) was at his best and then he came home in the afternoon for a nap to recover. That way he would be awake in the evening with the kids and went to sleep around 10pm so he could get a full night’s rest. Although it shortened his work day it lengthened the amount of time he was able to keep working and kept him on a regular schedule which really helps.   Similarly when the kids had sports events he would be sure to adjust his nap schedule and plan accordingly so that he could see them without being too taxed after.  Can’t remember when he started using the biPAP…think it was about 9 months after diagnosis but in retrospect he should have started it much sooner (recurrent theme for much of what we did/didn’t do). Definitely echo all said here about the benefit it gave him. He still only uses it at night and naps. He immediately feels energized when he puts it on (so much so that it sometimes takes him a little bit to go to sleep..but in a good way).",True,Turtals,2018-12-11 00:00:00,18,CALS,2016-12-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Newton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/sleeping-all-the-time-early-stages.43793/page-3
43793,2019-03-02 00:00:00,Sleeping all the time...early stages,Also wanted to share my and my husband’s two cents for the Spring Training trip: Highly recommend it.   Shortly after his diagnosis my husband took my older daughter to his alma mater (trip had been planned before diagnosis). It was a really important bonding time for them. Its too bad that no one is able to go with him (no high school or college friends?). But it sounds like he is still physically able to manage this and it sounds like you are an amazing planner and great at anticipating his needs. Here are some considerations if you have not already thought about them:  1. Driving - is he planning to drive while there? any other options for getting around? encourage him to limit driving later in the day. Are they staying somewhere with lots of restaurants nearby so that he can minimize driving at night?  2. Handicapped parking pass - does he already have one? if not I’d start the process now since you’ll need one anyway. If he can get it before the trip then he can bring along and will minimize the walking he has to do.  3. Assistive mobility device - MarieLaure made the great suggestion of a wheelchair*. But if he is stubborn with that insist that he brings along the walker at a minimum. As with so many things we started using the walker later than we should have. As soon as my husband started he immediately embraced it since he was able to move so much better and longer which enabled him to get past the ego thing. Added advantages of a walker is that its means he will never have to look for a chair if tired and avoids needing to carry a backpack since he can storage food and drink… which brings me to next point. (* maybe encourage him to get wheelchair or other assistance while in the airport at least…last thing he needs is to exhaust himself with a long walk to/from gates before the trip even begins)  4. Food and drink - So incredibly important that he eats frequently and stays hydrated which is especially hard when travelling. Consider sending them along with high calorie/easy to eat items - e.g. protein drinks (and straws!!! especially the wide ones). Or maybe give him a shopping list for things to get as soon as there. One “advantage” of this disease is that all the crappy foods my health conscious husband once avoided were now “good” for him. So on his trip with my daughter he enjoyed heaping plates of fried chicken biscuits and gravy grits etc.  5. Location tracking - my kids think its creepy but I have findmyphone (tells you where their phone is at that moment) and Life360 (tells you where they are as well as where they have been) on them and my husband. It gives me piece of mind to know where they are.  6. Packing/Dressing - Pack easy to put on clothes (e.g. no button-down shirts; avoid jeans; slip on shoes vs. shoelaces…though flip flops not good given risk of falling) any assistive tools like special utensils for eating or button-helper. Rollaway suitcases (remind your son to be sure he is the one to lift his and your husband’s suitcase to overhead).  7. Daily schedule - Encourage them to so stuff earlier in the day (when energy is highest) and to be sure to have naps built in with no exceptions. Should not push himself too far since he will pay for it later or the next day. And to be sure to eat regularly and BEFORE he gets hungry/tired.   8. Leverage your son - while you don’t want to you stress and overwhelm him empower him to help in his dad’s care/wellbeing. Teenagers are notoriously self-absorbed but gently encourage him to be more aware/proactive of things like being sure his dad is eating and drinking regularly; helping him to cut food and get dressed if needed; insisting on taking an afternoon nap; and understanding that he just cannot do everything that he once did so that they may mean they have to skip some things and call it a day earlier than either of them would like.,True,Turtals,2018-12-11 00:00:00,18,CALS,2016-12-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Newton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/sleeping-all-the-time-early-stages.43793/page-3
44808,2019-07-22 00:00:00,CALs Intro,I joined this forum awhile ago but am just seeing the CALs thread so thought I would reintroduce myself here. I'm another Nikki. I'm 37. Two kids - 9 and 11. My husband was diagnosed with ALS in March 2018. He is what I would call slow progressing but then again I have met people on an even slower trajectory so its hard to know how to define his path. He is still fully mobile and independent he is just very weak in his arms and hands so buttoning his pants starting the car and opening things is hard. He also has some slight slurring and weakening in his mouth and face. We have seen multiple people in our local ALS community who were diagnosed around the same time as him pass away so we feel blessed that we have had this chunk of time to do some traveling and living. Honestly I thought we would be where we are today a year ago - and thankful for the amazing support we get from our community.  All that being said its still an emotional roller coaster and I am dreading how he/we are going to cope with the loss of his independence. I feel like these forums give me a place to help prepare for our future (he's not a planner and is somewhat in denial) and know what types of things we might be up against.,False,nkrohan,2018-06-25 00:00:00,6,CALS,2017-12-01 00:00:00,US,OR,HOOD RIVER,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/cals-intro.44808/

44808,2019-07-24 00:00:00,CALs Intro,From personal experience and that of people on the forum one thing I found most disturbing is the discrepancy between the way some pals see the evolution and the way pals do. Both are right. Yes you need to plan ahead ( cals) and yes you need to ignore reality at times (pals). For instance yesterday I bought my dad one of those old fashioned bells for bikes for his wheelchair. He liked it very much. Yet he said let me do it. He can’t move any part of his body except his head. It is thanks to the forum and love that I still put it in his hand knowing he could not action it. My worry was : what would make him sadder : my telling him he couldn’t or his realizing he couldn’t ? As usual gather rosebuds he sang his way out of the problem.

44808,2019-07-24 00:00:00,CALs Intro,Welcome Nikki. My husband had a strong denial system which I think helped him cope with his losses . It definitely put more on me in terms of planning but I was willing to take that on for him. Something that helped me emotionally was to try to intellectually look at the future in order to plan. At the same time try to stay in the day/ moment emotionally try to focus on what he could do and how we could make it the best it could be.

44808,2019-07-29 00:00:00,CALs Intro,Hi Nikki welcome. My PALS is also a slow progressor. He is often in denial and says things like he wants to go surfing again. I do think it helps him to cope with what must be terrifying from the PALS point of view. It frightens me terribly to see what's happening to him from the outside so I can only imagine how he must feel.   My PALS did have a bit of progression starting in March; before that he was on a plateau and then suddenly it seemed to speed up. I had to very quickly get things that he needed. I had a parade of people coming through our house telling me what I needed to do and it was overwhelming. So I had to prioritize things and determine what he needed most in order of urgency. I think it's hard to determine what those things are going to be for your PALS but you know the sorts of support he will need and I've gotten a lot of help from other forum members. Right now I can say that the things I am doing for him (range of motion bipap cough assist help with bathing and dressing) are not as difficult as I had feared. Laurie's advice is lovely. We all dread the future if we think about it too much so be prepared but try not to spend too much time looking ahead.

41796,2018-07-22 00:00:00,NinaP's Mother,Nina I have to second what everyone is saying about telling your Mom what is going on. Let’s put it this way if it was you lying there would you be happy if your family would not tell you what was wrong? Wouldn’t you want to know? As other have said this is about no one but your Mom  If she wants to continue you need a feeding tube sooner rather than later. Laurie has already mentioned choking or pneumonia. Neither are a joke. My Brian has had pneumonia a few times mostly from insisting on still eating when he should not have been. He’s gone septic too and we nearly lost him then. That was the last food straw. From then on it was tube only.  Not only will the tube be used for food but also for meds. At some point she may need something for comfort and you won’t be able to give it by mouth. If she is on meds for any other conditions those too will need a way to be given and liquid is not the answer.  I don’t want to seem mean here but someone has to take the bull by the horns and tell mom and stand up to the rest. Do you think your sibs will feel any better if she chokes to death or gets pneumonia because she was denied the option to select a feeding tube?  Please Nina don’t deny your Mom the right to know.

41796,2018-07-22 00:00:00,NinaP's Mother,As a nurse; I see this everyday.... different cultures do different things.. I can’t tell you how many times the surgical consent has been signed by family members because the family didn’t want the patient to know they’re going for major surgery to remove a tumor for example. And trust me the patients don’t want to know either. I have witnessed first hand surgeons telling the patients what’s wrong with them and the patients look to their family members almost saying ‘you decide’. It’s not uncommon here and very common for other cultures.. so the question is who will make the decision for your mom when the time comes for maybe a feeding tube at best; and at worst a ventilator? Will you be okay with that decision or is this a conversation with the family and your mom or just the family? That’s the question.......Because if she truly has ALS it can progress so fast ( or sometimes very very slowly) you always feel that the disease is one step ahead. We’re here for you and your mom no matter what.,True,Sasha58,2018-06-17 00:00:00,43,Lost a loved one,2016-06-01 00:00:00,US,Florida,Broward,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/ninaps-mother.41796/page-4
41796,2018-07-22 00:00:00,NinaP's Mother,"Sasha  While I appreciate your professional perspective I think it's a slippery slope esp. in this day and age to generalize what patients do and do not want to know especially in the context of a specific person like Nina's mom whom we do not know. Nina has never stated that her mom does not wish to know her diagnosis; her account has in fact explicitly said otherwise.  Having been on the front lines in the hospital setting myself and published research in that area I think you'd agree that often the patients you think don't want to know actually don't know that right exists or that many people can and do exercise it. While their culture is their baseline context more are transcending it every day. In the past everyone from women to prisoners to ethnic minorities were considered less than autonomous agents. We recoil from those ideas today.  In the scenario you mention where the surgeon fully informs the patient and the patient defers decision-making to other family members there is still the ethical benefit in which the patient has been informed and thus her rights to a decision have been upheld even if she chooses not to exercise them. Never would we say that because some patients defer to their families we should not inform other patients of the truth.   Those of us who encourage Nina to inform her mom and preserve her autonomy are aware that both Nina and her mom are suffering the consequences of the ""don't ask don't tell"" approach to health information.

If you need support we are happy to provide it; more specifics about whatever issues/questions are in front of you right now would help.  On the ground I know there are in-person and virtual caregiver support groups focusing on sons and daughters and one of those might be helpful for you as well.

41449,2018-05-20 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,"Lenore yes you can get a rx and ""titrate away."" Not so simple with some hospices but you don't have to have hospice 1) at all or 2) around all the time. They work for you if at all.   For some here hospice has been a great help with a self-determined death. For others it's been a hindrance.   Note also that a PCP or neuro not affiliated with your clinic can write morphine.   If you choose hospice that is why I advise interviewing them as to their philosophy of things. Since you worked in hospice I'm sure you know as well as anyone about ""don't ask don't tell"" when it comes to the end of life.   For the record it is not required that hospice be around for any variant of VSED either. I think that is a myth propagated by the 60-to-0 notion (in terms of nutritional status) which is not generally going to be the variant used by PALS.  This is where communication in advance if not in real-time between the PALS &amp; CALS is so important. There is a point where you measure food drink morphine and another point where you don't.

41796,2018-07-27 00:00:00,NinaP's Mother,Oh Nina I am sorry things are hard  I am glad you told your mother though. Good for you!  Oxygen is almost always bad for PALS. What is the reason for her getting it? If her breathing muscles are weak the major issue would be co2 retention because she can’t push it out. Oxygen can make it worse. It is like people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and oxygen makes a PaLS breathe less and the co2 builds up more which can make them forget to breathe! If your doctor doesn’t know ALS tell him it is like COPD.   Bipap is a machine similar to cpap the sleep apnea treatment but it helps breathe in and out the out part ( which makes it bipap is necessary for PALS.

It is fear that you won't be here that often kept me away these past couple of years. Selfish I know. Chally--I am so very very glad that we all met in person. Beth is an amazing woman. Please kiss her for me. As for you keep clowning around. Sue you are much stronger that me. I can't imagine doing what you've done for so long by yourself. You humble me. Azgirl--wow. Just wow. You have taught more people about ALS about embracing life and about creating a movement (you are a rock STAR) than I'm sure you ever expected.   Laurie thank you. Relaxing makes sense. You always make sense!   PresentMoment you are so right about the grieving. I am probably strong right now because I've been grieving for so long. I pray that I have compassion and patience today for this who have stayed away and now want to show their tears. Again I do this for him.  Yesterday I settled on this Sunday to set my sweetie free. The family will all have been and/or be here. Yesterday in the midst of his crazy and during the few moments he was awake he said very clearly ""I don't want to know don't tell me"". Nope honey I won't. What I told him is that everyone is coming to visit him and we will have a party. He does not want them all in the room at once--he can't handle that--so we will rotate them through. Eldest daughter has door guard duty and will stop anyone who starts crying or talking about loss. Love--only love  He does know on some level of course. He's been waiting for his dad to visit. I'm still not sure that he won't upstage us and make his exit on his own schedule.   Something else I learned this week: once the decision is made for a loved one who cannot make it he or her self waiting makes no sense. It seems to at first for all sorts of scheduling reasons but planning death is unnatural and waiting for a planned death unbearable.  Something else I find myself thinking about is removing the vent. The nurse manager for our wonderful agency will be here prepared to do it but right now I think that task is mine. Mine should be the last hands tending him. I think. Now. On the other hand...  In the meantime I find myself impatient with people who want to cry--Even those who have been here with us through this mess. I can't do it yet and I don't need them doing it. I try to remind myself that they feel helpless and only my need to carry through with Matt's wishes is giving me strength--a crutch they don't have--so I try to be tolerant.

41449,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,My points were that hospice or not you will Need some medical involvement with Morphine and some prescribers are going to do some pretty close dose watching. To maintain comfort you are also going to need some medical involvement with VSED. It is most likely to be available from hospice.  Don’t ask don’t tell us essentially the prescriber not getting overly involved in how Morphine is used with a terminally ill person. In cancer for example that is often the only thing between the patient and unbearable pain.

41449,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,"This now takes the first place award for Best Thread in the world. Very real. Very kind.  My own little bit for your consideration: My PALS (an MD) opted for nothing. No tubes no feeding not even a drip for hydration. She allowed only a catheter to make it easier to clean up after her. Her orders were consistent ""When I have air hunger give me morphine not oxygen."" She did not want to live locked in.  Death by Dehydration gets mixed reviews. (Starvation doesn't count really because it takes 3-4 weeks to starve out.) A survey of hospice nurses in Oregon rated it 8 out of 10 for the gentlest way to go. But a doctor who helped his dad go through it for a week said his dad seemed quite agitated the whole time.  The info in this thread is soooo important and soooo right-on -point. Hospice works for YOU. If you get the sense they are not on your same page then consider giving them the boot.   Big Idea One: Advanced Directives. But I note that a few PALS simply refuse to discuss the matter. IN THIS CASE my advice is to draw up the papers completely then have the PALS simply sign them when they're able.  Big Idea Two: ALS is destroying a life. DON'T let it destroy two. The survivor must prepare for surviving including having the paperwork right and maximizing the insurance money etc.  Big Idea Three: ""Being of sound mind..."" is the time to make decisions. If your PALS has totally lost all rational thought and the hospice team is not helpful then the CALS might have to make some decisions that the others would disagree with.  I'll end with a Johnny Cash song:   You ask me if I'll get along / I guess I will someway / I don't like it but I guess things happen that way God gave me that girl to lean on / Then he put me on my own  Heaven help me be a man / And have the strength to stand alone / I don't like it but I guess things happen that way You ask me if I'll miss her kisses / I guess I will everyday / I don't like it but I guess things happen that way You ask me if I'll find another / I don't know.

Talking about these matters with my PALS I too find this thread very important. He's at a point where he'd be okay to just not wake up. Which is something else altogether than being proactive about end-of-life decisions. Making decisions takes energy.   Laurie if you would be so kind to delve into the importance of Bipap in making decisions I'd be very interested.  The backup rate if the machine is crucial to help him conserve energy I think.

41449,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,"I'm going to divide this into 2 posts this one on morphine the next on BiPAP since there's a lot to cover.   The medical involvement we had with morphine (remember we did not have hospice) was a PCP contacted via computer who wrote it who had seen Larry in the last year as is required and had been writing codeine (that we used prn) for his cough although that would not be a prerequisite.  I had the option of picking up the script or having it mailed. Then I had it filled and brought it home. Titration was totally up to us. And to clarify that had nothing to do with our state's dignified death law but was just a routine medical transaction.   I am aware that fewer docs write opoids these days because of hassles but no  laws or regulations  of which I am aware prohibit the transactions I just described. The link in the preceding sentence allows you to click on each state's regulations.   I double-checked Minnesota's. The only caveat I see is that a doc will need to feel comfortable with characterizing air hunger if the primary source of discomfort as ""intractable pain."" If you have a doc who doesn't see that relationship I would find another.   Again I agree life is a little different in hospice and processes/outcomes will vary. So I will repeat my suggestion that if you want/need hospice understand up front what the prevailing wind will be perhaps with a eye-to-eye question like ""Toward the end [I/name] do&lt;es&gt; not want to suffer past what we consider to be the end of life; how does your agency handle that?"" or whatever wording makes sense to you.  So my last point on VSED was that by the time someone is properly titrated in other respects VSED is moot.   If no one is pushing food/liquid in the pre-death phase (why I noted there is a point when we stop pushing) and the PALS can see that the CALS/family is at peace the PALS is already going to be naturally decreasing these to the point that morphine and BiPAP titration layered on top allow the death that reflects the P/CALS' preferences and values. I have seen a fair number of these ""nature's way"" deaths and they are not painful or prolonged.   I invite anyone uncomfortable discussing individual cases on the forums to PM me or leave me a visitor message and I will message you (you do not need to provide your email).

44871,2019-08-04 00:00:00,Als copd asthma...,If she did not have obstructive lung disease it would not be advised since ALS restricts the air flow rather than blocking it on the whole. But since she does her pulmonologist will have to trade those two things off and use the lowest oxygen concentration and flow rate possible. And since COPD and ALS both change over time so her oxygen and BiPAP settings should be re-evaluated frequently.

43860,2019-03-07 00:00:00,How are you?,"How I hate that question now.   It's become almost a default greeting. I know most people are trying to be kind by asking but I honestly don't know how to answer anymore. I usually just say ""We're OK"" or ""We're hanging in there"". But honestly we're not OK. And I'm sometimes just hanging on by a thread. So what should I say? ""Yeah life pretty much sucks right now?""  We've hit a rough patch lately. No big changes physically just the steady decline. It's this slow downhill roll that is getting the best of us. DH is frustrated and angry. He wants it ""to be over with"" in his words. I don't think he's ready to take any steps to hasten it but he is miserable. I feel for those who have fast progression and are gone so soon but honestly this long-term existence can be horrible too. And I do mean existence I can't say we have much of a life right now.  DH can't do much of anything for himself. I've tried to automate as much as possible with Alexa and other stuff to keep him as independent as possible. But what does one do to fill the hours when they have no use of their arms and legs and are constantly sore and fatigued? He's desperately bored. He spends hours upon hours watching TV. At night in bed he uses his iPad to watch videos or read. And winter has been tough. He's cold all the time so he doesn't want to go out. So he goes from the bedroom to the bathroom then to the sunroom where he sits with the heat up an electric blanket and the TV on until it's time to go to bed again. He eats in there and even has me bring the urinal so he doesn't have to drive his chair to the bathroom. And he wants me to sit there to be at his beck and call all day.  Sleep has been bad this week. Sunday night he had what I can only describe as a panic attack. He said he was hot and wanted the covers off. Then he said his heart was beating too fast. He was crying and telling me he wanted to go and how much he loved me. I checked him for a fever or anything else that I could think of and nothing was physically wrong. So I tried to calm him down but it took a long time. I gave him an additional Ativan (he takes a number of meds at night for sleep and anxiety). Finally he calmed down enough and did get some sleep but then I couldn't fall back asleep. The scene repeated itself to a somewhat lesser degree Monday night. Tuesday he seemed to sleep a little better but then yesterday all hell broke loose again.  He woke up around noon and wanted coffee. So I got him coffee and helped him with it in bed. He's gotten in the habit of staying in bed until he has to go to the bathroom (BM). So I watched the news with him until he said he had to go. Got the sling under him and hooked up and he says ""You didn't stretch me yet."" I usually stretch him and do his ROM before he ""goes"". He said he wanted me to put him back in bed after and stretch him. OK. Hoyered him to the commode where he has an awkward way that he ""has"" to be positioned to go. First he said he was too far to the left. Lifted him again put him back down. OK now? ""Sure"" was the answer I got. So I left to give him some privacy and stood on the other side of the door. He called for me and I see a giant puddle of urine on the floor. And I think somewhat of a smirk on his face. I didn't say anything just cleaned it up. He commented on how I wasn't doing that correctly either. Got him back in bed and went back to clean the commode and throw out the mess. Go back and start to stretch him - admittedly I'm a bit annoyed. Again he says I'm not doing it right and starts yelling that I don't care about him. Long story short we ended up yelling at each other for probably a half hour. I feel horrible. I don't know how everyone else seems to keep it together going through all this.  We're back to OK for now but I know this probably won't be the last time things go awry. The whole dynamic of our relationship has changed so much due to the situation. We both were independent but our strengths and weaknesses complemented each others so we worked well together. I love him and I know he does love me but we're struggling.  Sorry this has gone on so long but I've been holding a lot in and this weeks events I guess have been my tipping point. I needed to vent. I'm just so sad.",False,Jrzygrl,2017-02-14 00:00:00,720,Lost a loved one,2014-08-01 00:00:00,US,NJ,X,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/how-are-you.43860/
41449,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Laurie I want to know if there would be any issues with titration of Morphine if not on hospice from any kind of legal standpoint. (Sorry to semi-hijack your thread Lenore.)  For example in Oregon we have “death with dignity” law. But my understanding of this is that if it is used when patient is not on hospice the situation is treated as a coroner’s case (with potential prosecution of the surviving spouse). However if the patient is on hospice at the time everything is considered above board legally (no coroner’s case etc.).  I’m assuming the same might be true with morphine titration by a caregiver if not on hospice? I’m not sure about VSED.

41449,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Thanks everyone first for the reminder re staying in control of the hospice situation. Considering that hospice gave us morphine with 5 refills and no claim of intractable pain I think we are in the right place so far.   Thanks for the beautiful words from Johnny Cash Mike. A soft spot in my heart for him for sure.  I will say I did my hospice work in the 1990’s. At that point we were still as a nation wresting with the notion of Brain Death. For Americans who may recall the Nancy Cruzan case in which a brian dead woman’s family had to go through years of legal hells to get her tube feedings discontinued had not yet happened. No state had a right to die law.  So regardless of if legal realities were different in my state or not (they were not by much) I don’t feel that self determination in this matter had the popular legitimacy it does today. That’s good news because it might well help to explain the 5X refill. Those were once routinely dated for next available pick up time at least around here.  Thanks Tillie for the notes on doseage- interesting.  I must say it’s been rough. I kind of hate that we are dealing with hospice now. I hate talking about Morphine. I hate that Medicare does not pay for Riluzole for people in hospice because it is a life prolonging treatment.

41449,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,"As promised here is part 2 [BiPAP titration] as relates to the concept of morphine titration.  If someone is on BiPAP for all or most of the time and has a backup rate set death while wearing the mask in sleep is somewhat unlikely though not impossible.   The reason for this is that less energy is expended in sleep and the backup rate combined with the ""target volume"" that is most often part of the settings then provides of course a minimum level of air volume each minute.   So as long as the PALS has enough musculature to process the air that the machine provides and settings are optimal s/he will likely not experience fatal respiratory insufficiency in sleep. However CO2 is probably building up over time.  CALS can combine titration of the BiPAP with that of morphine (the latter discussed in my previous post).   Of course before either is undertaken for someone who is already dying final words should be exchanged so that all can be at peace. When you read about prolonged death typically someone is ""fighting."" What is described here is when the PALS has finished the fight.  As morphine is increased the corresponding titration for BiPAP would be to gradually reduce the target volume still with a backup rate though the backup rate may never have been triggered up to this point in the disease. At some point the person will fall and stay asleep.   Sometimes CALS do not change the BiPAP settings which could prolong life.   Either way when breaths are very shallow and all are being triggered by the BiPAP (as can be seen on the data screen or just by looking) that would signify that only the machine via the backup rate is sustaining life.  Then if the mask is removed and the machine turned off it is time to let his/her hand go.",True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hold-on-tight.41449/page-5
41449,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Karen good question I answered in another thread but not in this one.  I had Larry's advance directive in the bedroom. When I called 911 to report his death we got paramedics (who pronounced and then wanted to see the directive; it was quite visually obvious that Larry had been dosed with morphine recently) followed by cops who had obviously chatted with the paramedics off camera followed by the coroner's designate (who never came up to the apt. but was dealt with by the cops also off camera).   NOTE: if we had been in a state or country less tolerant of self-directed death I would have cleaned up a little more and simply stated [truthfully] that he died while sleeping. If you want this kind of death and are not sure how to do it message me.   As soon as the lead paramedic glanced at the directive he said he was sorry for our loss and that was that. That's why I say keep it handy if you're not using hospice. It would have been stickier if I did not have it guaranteed.  As for my interaction with the cops it wasn't much -- a matter of form-filling. There was no judgment or interrogation. They did ask our son for his ID which I found interesting since no one asked for mine but he was wearing his habitual black hoody...they were very nice and offered to stay with us until the hearse arrived but there was no need so I sent them on their way.  The coroner's designate off camera released the body and the cops then called the cremation facility using the number I gave them to tell them they could pick up the body. Meanwhile I set in motion the brain and other donations that Larry gave for research; a pathologist was sent to the facility to do the harvesting prior to the cremation.  All this took &lt; an hour.  So yes while the coroner's designate was called out because it was a home death sans hospice I never saw him or her.  The doc who wrote the morphine Larry's PCP was on vacation so her PA signed the death cert based on his chart which of course had the morphine in it and the correspondence about getting it only a week before when I had first thought death was near.  --Laurie,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hold-on-tight.41449/page-5

You are not alone -- you have your kids your friends other family and us! When the darkness closes in don't hesitate to start typing whenever you need us.   As for lack of hope no doubt that the hundreds of solutions P/CALS buy kludge and borrow every day and news of incremental research breakthroughs have to stand in for near-term expectations of a greatly-changed prognosis.   Maybe whatever happiness and peace we find under the hanging sword are all the more precious for our having made them ourselves under the most difficult of circumstances.

Also After one month on Hospice they have started hinting that my husband isn't dying fast enough for them (they didn't use those words but that's what they mean). Unbelievable. They don't do a whole lot but the knowledge they are there to make him more comfortable as he progresses is very important to him. When I called his regular doctor about his anxiety before we started hospice he said just increase his trilogy time which did nothing to help. I feel like everything is just a business and there seems to be no real concern for the patient.   There are a myriad of other things as you all know. My other daughter went to the doctor and the nurse read the wrong chart and told her she had something she doesn't and scared her to death before they finally straightened it out.   My younger daughter said when she runs and gets to the final bill she wants to stop but thinks Just one more hill I can do it.

44879,2019-08-06 00:00:00,New CALS...next steps?,So sorry to hear that.  If she and her husband are interested you could consider researching the options to get a speech device. Maybe the ALS society in her area has one in the 'closet' as when they apply for it through the normal channels it will take a while to get it. The Gleason Foundation is also a good source for these kind of things.   It will be a tremendous help for her and the caregivers when they still can communicate at least to some degree after speech is too hard to understand. She will need a bit of time to practice so that it is not too hard to learn as she gets weaker.   My partner lived for about 16 months after diagnosis. His progression was on the faster side. He did not want a feeding tube and after a few clinic visits we chose palliative care. They were very helpful to us. We did exactly what others have recommended here: we stayed on palliative care until we had the equipment we needed. We could always contact a social worker from the ALS society who helped when we needed it. Maybe they have one too and would welcome you to get in touch with that person?   Not having a feeding tube shortened the time with ALS as it progresses faster if a pALS cannot take in enough calories.,True,ReginaS,2018-11-20 00:00:00,211,Lost a loved one,2018-02-01 00:00:00,US,VA,--,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/new-cals-next-steps.44879/

44889,2019-08-08 00:00:00,Adjustable Bed Advice?,I really didn’t want a hospital bed. But I was having trouble getting out of my bed so I knew I needed something with adjustable height. And I started having difficulty turning in bed so I knew I needed something with bars I could grab while I could still grab. And I knew I needed a twin width so a caregiver could access me from either side without hurting her back So when all was said and done I ended up with a hospital bed.  It’s ugly and noisy but it does the job. And having those bars to grab onto has been a huge help. I have the bars in the “down” position but I can still grab the tops of them to help me turn. Raising the head of the bed has made it easier to sit up so I can position myself to get out of the bed. The twin width has also made it easier for me to do ROM exercises. I like having the foot board to push my floppy feet into. And there is plenty of room to maneuver a Hoyer underneath when I get to that stage.  There are other options as you will find among these threads. Just like with wheelchairs and vans you have to get one that suits not only your present needs but also your anticipated needs.

His speech is very poor and only I can understand him although that is getting harder for me too.   His neck is completely flexed and tilted to the right and is in pain but refuses my attempts to give him any pain meds other than Tylenol which is pretty useless. He complains about his neck all day.

I had a talk with my husband about patience I framed it that we both need to be patient with each other but he is very sensitive to any suggestion that he is not patient... so I told him even if it was just my feeling that he was short or snapping at me it was a valid feeling. We also were very independent people and he is used to me handling a lot of stuff on my own and I don’t think quite realizes that I am still handling all those things plus taking care of him 24/7.  The sadness is so overwhelming. I love him and miss him at the same time.

How I wish I could get my PALS and his wife to read these. I'm sister of PALS. Does that make me a caretaker? Am I allowed the honor of this title?  PALS was only diagnosed 3 months ago. They took two trips at the advise of all though he was apprehensive about doing this. Two serious backward falls after the travel and resulting hospital stays (now in acute rehab for a couple of weeks) has them looking at the safety issues of their own house. We sibs are politely asked not to get involved. The realities of the beast are very very hard to accept of course. But one has no choice but to accept those realities.  Here's my question for you or anyone else out there who knows: does travel speed the progression of the disease? All best to you and your PALS and to all others here.  P.S. Hooray that NC finally is going to give teachers a raise!

47214,2020-11-26 00:00:00,Life post-trach: mental health?,Hi Jon I am sorry I didn’t see this until now - no notification or anything. My wife has the support of the assisted communication technology people in the NHS here. They came out for a visit and have adapted settings and left a picture card and an alphabet sheet thing. To be honest I wasn’t sure that they were different kinds of Tobii devices. Why would the I-series be better? I’m curious to see if we can get away from frustration and back to some sort of communication. It’s been some time now since my wife was able to blink properly. We had to move away from that to rolling her eyes up for yes and down for no. The typing seems almost compulsive at times but it’s not producing words or phrases that make sense. I mean it’s not unicorns and spaceships or anything but just unsettling comments which feel like they conceivably could be true but happen not to be (eg telling me I’d gone for a walk with a friend I haven’t seen for 18 months).  Anyway thanks for checking back in. I saw your posts elsewhere and am very sorry for your loss.

44826,2019-07-26 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,Today is our anniversary...16 years ago we were married. Most people just say these words as part of their vows; we CALS live it every day. We have now spent 25% of our married life with this unwanted third party.   I was having a good month this month; I have gotten the contractors on board to start the elevator project; got the non-operational sports car moved out of the garage so the contractors can actually do their work; shopped for bought and had the bidet toilet installed; got an AFO for my PALS. In addition to managing what is left of his business and working part time at mine. He is still progressing but slowly; though I am a little concerned about the amount of time he now needs the Bipap after starting on it just 4 months ago.  Then I scrolled through my Facebook feed and noticed a post from some people we were friends with. They had a lovely get together at their house with many of our other friends. We would have been there in the past but now we were not invited. Despite the fact that they have been pretty darn scarce since diagnosis it still made me feel really sad.  On a more positive note a good friend got good news about her cancer; she went through chemo for 3 months and looks to be clear. And I have planned a trip to Yellowstone for the end of August. I was actually able to get ADA rooms at the lodges within the park! Thought that would be impossible but there were some vacancies. I know my PALS is often fatigued and short on energy I know he isn't always in the best mood and feels frustrated but I so wanted him to have this experience. I told him if he really is struggling we can turn around and come home. He is still able to get up and out and now is the time for us to do these things. So I'm hoping we will have this experience together.

44973,2019-08-31 00:00:00,Something a little lighter - perhaps,Hi all! In 2019 we’ve been on a crazy journey from mild shoulder pain to no limb movement and full 24/7 Trilogy use. With a diagnosis on 4 January and several months of rapid progression it’s fair to say this year has mainly been too much to handle. Both my PALS and I have birthdays coming up: in fact we have them on consecutive days. It’s the first one post diagnosis so I’m struggling to think what could still be meaningful/fun/useful etc. Nice toiletries are sorted though for bed bath rather than the shower. Tasty food to eat at home though the mask makes that a little trickier. Perhaps an audiobook or something? How do you adapt to the lack of mobility but choose something entertaining? Any suggestions from other CALS whose PALS have enjoyed something from either the bed or recliner? Thanks very much in advance.,False,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/something-a-little-lighter-perhaps.44973/
44889,2019-08-09 00:00:00,Adjustable Bed Advice?,"I continue to recommend considering a hospital bed that you can place adjacent to yours a couple of inches apart. In addition to adjusting the height and head/feet angles you can swap out mattresses and overlays as needed and have room on every side of the bed [assuming you don't use a headboard or footboard] for his care changing linens and transfers.   With a split king you lose at least one side of the bed and maneuvering room for the Hoyer and pivots. I understand the lure of the adjustable bed I just don't want anyone who can't afford it to have to pay twice if it doesn't work out. Medicare does contribute to the hospital bed.  With linens on a boardless frame a hospital bed really doesn't look like one and the adjacent bed shouldn't be that much these days (I am currently sleeping well on a $50 frame $150 mattress $200 overlay).  For context Larry got out of bed every day until his last week so I am not saying this from the perspective of being ""confined to bed"" but rather for the considerable care that must be given there.",True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/adjustable-bed-advice.44889/
44889,2019-08-09 00:00:00,Adjustable Bed Advice?,I second what Laurie said. We bought a split king adjustable bed but eventually needed a hospital bed for the height adjustment. Unfortunately the first hospital bed did not have the Trendelenburg feature. Bed #3 did. We ended up with a hospital bed for hubby with all the bells and whistles and you want them trust me and next to it my half of the split king on wheels. In the morning I rolled it away so we could tend him and at night I rolled it next to his bed. Because I'm planning a mobility accessible Air BnB next year I kept the bed. I took the headboard footboard and side rails off and put a regular mattress on it and aside from the foot pedals you can not tell the difference. It looks like I have a regular king.   If money is a consideration get a twin bed and a hospital bed and put them together. If you want adjustable features for yourself get a twin adjustable bed for yourself.

On our spring trip to Yellowstone we ran into a wonderful woman who lost her husband to ALS some time ago. She offered to donate their hospital bed to us.

Even now I am trying to be patient while listening to him complain about what he would be doing if he weren't ill giving injections of methylcobalamin in the faint hope that it will slow things down taking calls from doctors and nurses regarding Radicava (he doesn't want to do it if he has to go to an infusion center) helping him dress tying his shoes putting bengay on his back nightly giving massages doing 100% of the housework and household management. Going shopping for a lightweight wheelchair this weekend just to help him conserve energy. OK I am not yet toileting or bathing as you are.

It was only water but I guess I had not put enough in the flush side and sleeping still was not great   Yesterday I again got the food in in 16 and made sure I loaded up the bags well with water even though it's running very slow just enough to keep him hydrated over night. I am going to slowly D.C. It but he lodes the always do well with cohange and I'm not sure he noticed the change in food because I didn't tell him but he does here the pump run.  I slept last night in our room in my bed. Comfort wise that was good. The noise seemed even louder after being away from it for a few nights. Sleep was about the same but maybe slightly better at least early on. Then I had to get up to use the bathroom and that's when the noise became more of an issue as I wasn't as tired.   On another note since DS was here yesterday while DD and I went to a family wedding shower Brian wanted to get out for a walk. So DS and I (after I got home) got him up. I had DSs dog our little dog rode on Brian's lap and DS controlled the WC. It was an interesting walk and a real workout for DS however Brian was happy.   DD was struggling again late yesterday. She is having trouble sleeping all part of what's going on with her. I just wish it would not take 4-6 weeks for the Zoloft to fully kick in. Today will be day 5 so I'm praying for some slight improvement for her. That is what is killing me most right now.   Other devastation on the rest of the family or collateral damage however you choose to put it is one of the worst parts ever. So many times when I wish I could go back and change the decision to vent. If we could only see the future sometimes but we do the best we can with the knowledge we have and just keep plugging away.

39014,2017-07-09 00:00:00,Struggling,While I wish things could change in bigger ways and more rapidly there are a few small steps forward there. It must feel like as many backwards as forwards steps though.  Interesting that you slept back in your room and really noticed the noise more. Did DS move your bed over to the other room so you can try sleeping in your own bed away from the noise?

39014,2017-07-09 00:00:00,Struggling,Things will slowly improve just have to figure out the right combination.   My bed is still in our room. I did not ask to have it moved because after the walk DS needed to get back home. His i laws are in town and he had obligations there as well. And in order to put my bed in the other room I have to move other things out. Since stairs are involved I really need DD's BF here too. I'm thinking of it doesn't happen before DD heads off to school it can happen then as I'll have two strong men here to do the lifting.   I still may try the office as well and I'd that's the case I still need my strong guys because there are two desks to move out to put the bed in. Thinking of trying the floor in there tonight just to see what the sound level is like. Better to try all options before moving things hither and yawn and back again.

39014,2017-07-09 00:00:00,Struggling,Does your daughter exrrcise regularly? It might help. When I workout it helps a lot.   When the mil comes by  I would escape for a bit. Even a quick walk outside or a cup of coffee outside.   I apologize for not knowing but have you looked into food delivery or ordering online and picking it up? Sometimes there is a charge but walmart doesnt charge for the order if you pick it up.  I use a company that shops at costco. I get cooked ribs enchiladas etc so it is only a warming up situation. Several online sites can ship you meals. I am trying to thimk of reductions in time and energy.  I generally stock fruitveggiesand salad.

39014,2017-07-10 00:00:00,Struggling,Gooseberry - thank you for thinking of DD. She is a personal trainer and probably get more exercise than all of us combined : ). I agree that exercise is huge. I've actually missed some of mine lately trying to get DD relaxing in some fashion. I will get it back though.   I looked into the groceries not long ago and while there is a place or two that would deliver they upcharged everything to an unreasonable level. I don't have a problem with paying a bit more for delivery but 4 and 5 times the price is a bit extreme. I'm hoping that now that Amazon has purchased Whole Foods maybe we will get Amazon fresh here. The walmart near me doesn't have fresh foods as it's not a super Walmart and they don't have grocery pick up unfortunately. Everytime i hear about a new grocery delivery company I check it out. If I can find something reasonable I will definitely give it a go.   Ok so last night I slept in the office on the floor. I was more relaxed being closer to the bedroom and the sound level was perfect. I can't say I slept well but that was due to the hard floor not anything else. I am going to look harder as where I can move the desks. My personal one for sure can move fairly easily and possibly into our bedroom where the bed I use currently is. The more difficult one is my office desk. I really don't want business stuff in there esp for when I do have help so that is going to take some thought.   If I use the office I need a blind for the window to block light and a shear for the door (it is glass French style only 1 door). I can definitely make the space work just have to figure out the other. However having the baby monitor now opens up possibilities for the desk that I didn't have before. Much thinking to be done but we are on the right path.   Thank you everyone for your continued thoughts and suggestions. I could not do this without you.

40910,2018-05-18 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Hi Fayj and welcome to the ALS forums. I'm sorry you find yourself here and I am sorry you are feeling like an outlier as far as being a sibling and not a spouse. I would like to emphatically voice my opinion that travel does NOT speed up progression per-se. However stress falls physical insults to ones body or psyche could at least make things seem somewhat worse at least at the time. Travel or pursuit of whatever the PALS enjoys is worthwhile and makes the present time/life of the PALS more enjoyable and less routine. However if the PALS (in your case your brother) really does NOT want to travel &amp; his anxiety level is heightened by the very thought of it then travel (more than just day trips etc.) may not be for him. If your brother/PALS used to enjoy travel then it can easily be done safely - BUT he (brother/PALS) and his wife need to accept the fact that safety preparedness &amp; anticipation of present and future safety equipment needs are paramount to lessen the risk for injuries. Unfortunately ALS is a progressive disease and your PALS &amp; his spouse need a reality check that things will get worse instability will get worse dependency upon others and safety equipment will increase and they need to anticipate these needs and meet these challenges. Travel when undertaken responsibly and with all equipment needs anticipated can be very enjoyable and give a PALS much needed escape and things to look forward to.  And YES - you definitely can and do deserve to call yourself a CALS! You are interested and trying to be involved in your brother's care and I admire that so much! Do all that you can (if you want to which it sounds like you do!) to try to convince your SIL to allow you to be involved. Try not to tell her what to do. Offer to be there help out etc. but ultimately your SIL needs to come to the realization that ALS is an extremely challenging disease and that she will be blessed to have you as an ally / now or later.  Blessings to you Fayj and I am sure you will get more responses but you may be encouraged to start your own thread or your post may be moved. Wishing you the best!,True,Buckhorn,2016-01-03 00:00:00,725,Lost a loved one,2015-12-01 00:00:00,US,PA,Small town,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/venting-tomorrow-which-will-surely-cause-more-venting.40910/page-6
40910,2018-05-18 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Fay welcome to our little family! Of course you are a Cals if you are interested enough to read here and ask questions in an effort to help your brother and sister-in-law.  The very thought of this disease is overwhelming and sometimes having too many voices in the conversation can make things even harder. I do hope that your brother and sister-in-law find a way to be comfortable with your help sooner than later because they will need it.   I agree with Buckhorn that travel does not need to speed progression but the effort expended while traveling can. My husband traveled drove from NC to Colorado each year for the first 4 years after diagnosis. The first year he drove himself (against my wishes and with some hair raising experiences) and the last two years other family members made the trips with us to help out. He started in the truck with a the chair on a lift on the back and we now have a very very large van and an enclosed trailer for hauling all of his equipment.  I told him after last Fall that we are done traveling across country. He needs a hospital bed. I can get them put into hotels at our destinations but arranging that all the way across country for one night at a time is too much. Unfortunately I think that not having the trips to look forward to has done a lot of harm. People trapped in bodies that don't work still need to feel alive and if travel is what does it for them then they need it in some form.   Having said all of that I'm sure that the last trip at least did speed things up for Matt. It was exhausting but I would not change a thing.   One more tip no need to quote the original post. Many of our PALS use eye gaze equipment and have trouble getting past them.   I do hope that you will start a thread and let us get to know you. Hopefully you can share this site with your PALS and his wife. Most of us have learned more here than anyplace else (including from Docs and clinics).

40910,2018-05-21 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,I'm almost afraid to say it but things seem to be much better. This is day 10 of the antibiotics and other measures and my guy's finally putting out something that looks like soft serve ice cream instead of liquid. He also had some actually move while he was lying in the bed (finished when we lifted him in the sling) so it looks like things might be working properly again.   We ended up taking him off muscle relaxers to help the bowels and we stopped several things that can irritate the stomach. Now if he stays on milk based formula we will go through this again but now we've established care with the GI clinic at Duke and can call for an appointment and antibiotics when he starts to bloat up--hopefully in time to prevent another hospital stay for Ileus. I can't remember if I explained this here but apparently his Diabetes inactivity and milk based formulas caused an overgrowth of bacteria in his lower intestine---which caused way way too much gas. Nothing was moving so his stomach and intestines were all full of air.  Oh the GI folks think his problem now is inactivity. Even turning him every two hours as we do for the butt will help the stomach and intestines. Laying in one position in bed for 24 hours is terrible for the body.   I got him out yesterday for a short walk and he slept well and woke up refreshed. I had gone most of last week without a nurse because she was on vacation and then she was out yesterday because she sprained her finger very badly (the doc wanted her out three days but she's here today). Today I have taken three naps.

Thank you on the education/reinforcement of the fact that any movement (even simply rolling side to side) helps to improve motility of the bowels. While my PALS bowel program is far from perfect I think his bowel mobility improved when we began using a probiotic formula from Amazon. If anyone is interested go to Amazon and search ""Hyperbiotics PRO-Bifido Probiotic Support for Ages 50 60 Time-Release Tablets"". I only give Dave one per day. When I stop giving them to him he is much less likely to have a bowel movement regardless of 2 daily Colace a daily Senokot and a fiber (psyllium) tablet..

I have thought of our marriage vows often too. The reality of those words.  I get the Facebook thing too. I'm conflicted about social media. I'm glad I can connect with friends since I don't even get out of the house much lately but am sad about all the things in which we can no longer participate. Even when we were invited to friends houses for things we often had to decline due to accessibility issues.  I agree get out and do things. I wish we had done more while DH was more mobile. He has decided that he is most comfortable staying home now and any trip outside the house causes him a great deal of anxiety.  Fingers crossed that all goes well on the Yellowstone trip. We stayed in a cabin on the rim of the Grand Canyon one year. It was awesome and I'm so glad we did it when we could.

Brian had the beast for 14 years we made almost 34 years (2 months shy) so nearly 1/2 of our married life was with the beast.  I totally get it about the friends and family. I actually asked my SIL at one point to not let me know about the parties as it got way to hard to always decline. I’m actually on FB more now than I was for several years.

44826,2019-07-29 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,V I hope you have a wonderful trip!! It's a lot of work but our travels are some of my best memories.   As for the better or worse--this was in some ways a gift to me. That sounds terrible but stick with me. Matt always took fabulous care of me. He was more creative than me and constantly surprised me with wonderful romantic adventures. For almost 20 years he was better at showing his love to me than I was to him. I loved and adored him but just didn't have his capacity for grand gestures or the energy to accomplish everything he did.  Then came ALS and we all know what that means. While I would trade it in a microsecond to have him back I finally had the opportunity to show him how much I loved him. To be the one doing for him. He let me know that he learned even more about doing the right thing for people based on how I cared for him. In many ways ALS made a wonderful marriage into an epic adventure.   When people asked how I managed I explained that he was my husband and our life was together. Aside from not being able to spend as much time with our children and grandchildren I didn't miss the life we didn't have--I felt privileged to live the life we had together.   Those people who don't invite you. Is it possible that the think they'll make you feel worse about your situation if you have to decline? Many people just don't know how to handle this situation. I'm struggling now with someone I thought was one of Matt's best friends. He lives just down the street and would not come despite being asked to see Matt once he was bed bound. He couldn't handle seeing another friend deteriorate and die. He is now struggling and apparently visitors are wanted. This will be my biggest test of forgiveness. I need to go see him.   Social media was a huge help to us. I wasn't sure it would be because pre-ALS Matt was very private about his health and medical conditions. Thankfully once he came to grips with the beast he went very public in his own effort to spread awareness. Because Matt loved to get out and to share his adventures all of his friends and acquaintances knew what he was up for. We had wonderful friends who organized get togethers at our house with specific groups and people were excited to come.   Accessibility is an issue in visiting other people's homes but it sure would be nice to at least hear from friends that they miss you and wish you could join them. Maybe they could be taught by reading posts thanking other people for reaching out. Sometimes I think that what we have to share with the world includes lessons on how to interact with someone who is dying. Often the simplest answer (treat the like you always did as they are the same person) is the hardest to find.   Back to that trip. I am so glad that you were able to get the accessible room! Enjoy!!

44826,2019-07-29 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,Thanks Becky...glad to hear your love story with Matt. My PALS never spent much time at anything but his business except perhaps his mom. I have always wanted him to have some wonderful experiences with me but I've had to work on him to do anything even when he was well. I feel fortunate that his progression was slow for the first few years and we were able to take a trip to Greece last year which I planned completely on my own. I was hoping to do some things this year but had to cancel everything when his condition worsened. He's much better after we introduced the bipap and has told me he will go.  I hear you about Matt's friend. I like to think I will be able to understand illness better than before and be more giving but who knows how I'll feel as time goes on. People do disappear. It is hard enough for me to see my PALS this way and I've been here through every loss. I think it is even harder when people haven't seen him in a while and then see how much weight he has lost and how much difficulty he has walking using his hands and breathing. I am also noticing speech difficulties of late.  Anyway mixed feelings too about FB Sue and Jrzygrl! I will say that I am thankful for it because I had lost touch with some really good friends along the way and was able to reconnect. They've actually been in touch more than some of my local friends. Also get to keep in better contact with my family who live far away.   So will keep you all posted on Yellowstone. Hopefully we will be there in a month.

44826,2019-07-31 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,So as if the caregiving stress was not enough yesterday I was broadsided by a woman who had decided she had gotten off on the wrong exit and needed to get back on the freeway without stopping at the stop sign. My 2010 Prius which I was going to keep until I need a handicap van was likely totaled and I was taken to the ER. I'm in a lot of pain and am pretty banged and bruised up but hopefully nothing serious.   So the car I was going to drive to Yellowstone is no more and I will need to decide what to do for a vehicle. Also am concerned about taking care of my PALS with a sore back shoulder sternum and probably other aches and pains that I haven't felt yet. I do have a caregiver but she is off Thurs to Mon this week. Luckily my PALS' friend has offered to come over tomorrow and other friends are bringing dinner.   I can't recall which of us CALS said we think nothing else bad should happen to us because the worst already has! Life isn't like that though. Yikes.

44994,2019-09-06 00:00:00,Back from Yellowstone,We arrived home yesterday late afternoon after a wonderful but exhausting trip to Yellowstone. It is certainly HARD traveling with a PALS even one who can transfer easily and walk a little with a walker! I learned a lot from this experience...it is much easier if I can book several days in one place to avoid having to lug all of the equipment in and out of rooms; ADA rooms are highly variable (Yellowstone was great but Grand Teton had a bathtub with a grab bar - not helpful!). I sure wish my PALS was a little less in denial and would have let me get a handicapped placard and a power chair or scooter. As it was I pushed him in a transport chair throughout the park even dragging him on dirt surfaces to get him to a picnic table or to various sights. I also spent much of my time assisting him with toilets (also variable - a toilet marked with a handicap sign required transiting up a curb...seriously?) and in and out of the car. I was able to do a few small paintings while we were there while my PALS sat patiently having a picnic but had to rush him to the car at one site when it started to hail. I also had a stupid fall at Grand Teton - missed a step and fell flat out onto the asphalt in a parking lot injuring my hand. That made it much more challenging with the push chair but luckily I did that on the last day.  At any rate I'm so thankful that we were able to do this trip together. My PALS had never been to Yellowstone and had a wonderful experience despite my couple of meltdowns. The delight in his face as we watched Old Faithful together was priceless. We saw literally hundreds of bison but only a few elk in Yellowstone. In Grand Teton we saw a moose and her calf along with quite a few more elk. He was on the bipap a lot of the time; he seems to need more breathing support these days and I'm not sure what to make of that.   I will share photos on Stories of Hope when I get a chance to go through them. For now catching up...and thankful that his caregiver is here today. I have to admit I was thrilled to see her!

Its so hard being caregiver and wife know that you are doing the best you possibly can in an impossible situation and after that fall I began telling my husband I was going to make an ‘executive’ decision when he resisted care that I knew was in his (our) best interest.

44991,2019-09-06 00:00:00,In Praise of Wheelchair Van Rentals,"This may be a ""preaching to the choir"" post here but today my partner/PALS had her ALS clinic visit today (always a stressful day for both of us) and for the first time we rented a wheelchair accessible van for transport. It was the BEST thing and we are both over the moon about it!  Over the last year and a half we have had to take an accessible taxi to and from the clinic. They are very affordable but the trade off is that they are usually old creaky smelly tiny vans with steep ramps that cause my partner physical pain to ride in because her wheelchair has to be sitting fully upright to get the door closed. The other medical transport services are either extremely expensive (thousands of dollars) or do not accommodate power chairs (too heavy) or are only available for emergencies and not appointments.  My partner looked up a few rental options and our clinic social worker offered some suggestions too. We found a company that--for a fee--would deliver and pick-up and the van is practically brand-new so much room inside for the wheelchair to recline and store all the gear we have to take the ramp is not steep at all it smells fresh and is clean and we can use it on our own time while we have it. It took away SO MUCH stress. The cost was still a little prohibitive but you get what you pay for. On our way there and back home every time I checked the rear view mirror she looked totally blissed out. She loved riding in it and I enjoyed driving it. I felt like a frickin' boss!  The rental requires we have it for a minimum of two days so I'm taking another day off work and we are going for a joy ride! Something we used to enjoy together before DX and that we haven't done at all since her tracheotomy last summer. No destination planned--just gonna enjoy the drive!",False,gardenvessel,2019-08-22 00:00:00,12,CALS,2018-03-01 00:00:00,US,WA,,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/in-praise-of-wheelchair-van-rentals.44991/

My sister's husband has rapidly-advancing ALS He was diagnosed in Summer 2017. Two years ago this fall he only had a barely perceptible limp. Today he is completely disabled. My sister (&amp; best friend) is his only caretaker....his choice. We are stuck on two issues that need to be somehow resolved and are looking for viable suggestions. First (and please excuse me for this) butt wiping. He WILL NOT let her see him naked although they've been married for 35 years. So that being said does anyone know of a device that would work ergonomically (his hands barely function) and for the obvious (Charmin style). Second his gag reflex is at a point now where almost anything (it changes minute to minute) causes him to gag violently when ingested. He's lost and continues to lose a lot of weight. He drinks a lot of Boost and protein shakes sometimes gagging on even those. We my husband I and my sister are working together to help them (him) in any way possible.

45111,2019-10-01 00:00:00,When am I worrying too much?,"Hi everyone! My brother was diagnosed back in April. We've been told he's slowly progressing and can still walk but with balance issues and has lost quite a bit of strength. He's single and basically doesn't have anyone else in the family to lean on for what are sure to be tough times down the road.   I'm the overly protective big sister. When he was first diagnosed I was so overwhelmed but quickly came to realize that not every single thing needed to be tackled immediately. I don't want to push him with conversations he's not ready to have even though I know we need to have them (estate planning trusts will home modifications etc.). So I worry. I want him to be safe (he sometimes pushes himself past his limits) but don't want to nag. So I worry.   I want him to enjoy his quality of life while he still has it and I worry even more (like when his friend bought him a Nascar driving experience...OMG). I worry that we will run out of time to do the planning that he will put himself in a bad situation and hurt himself and that I (or anyone else) won't be there to help. I've tried to talk to him about it and he tells me ""I'm fine"" and that I worry too much. I've told him that it's my job as the big sister to look out for him. How much is too much? How do I know when to push/nag and when to back off?

39014,2017-07-11 00:00:00,Struggling,update:  The cushioning I added to the office floor did the trick. Now don't jump too high but i did sleep better and have noted that if I can make all the needed changes putting my bed there will be a good thing and obviously much more conducive to sleep. : )  The deck is now complete. The minute my nephew finished cleaned up and left it started pouring rain again. It rained over night too so no sitting out this morning. However it is drying up nicely so maybe later. All depends if some of the humidity goes with it. Last time I was out with the dog it was so thick. Checked my app and it said 80% humidity. That is not relaxing.    So it's all measured out and I can definitely put my bed in that room. I can move my personal desk into my bedroom where my bed it now. I currently have my sewing machine on it so sewing in the room with Brian will be a good thing. Now to figure out the work desk. It could stay in the office room but I really don't want to sleep at my job. I want a serene space for sleeping. So I have to figure out where to put the desk to work. I will get that figured out but I do need to make sure my work computer is capable of wifi which I believe it is. I currently have it tied directly to the modem. Its slowly coming together. oh and I need my muscle men for help : )  On another good note DD is starting to feel a lot better. I noticed a little change on Sunday. Then I asked her today and she said yesterday and today she's noticed a change. That is a huge praise for sure and takes something off of my stress plate.  And we got an antibiotic ordered for Brian. I think his foley issues w/sediment were partially due to a UTI. He's had two doses so far and says he's feeling better. The nurse will be here soon to insert a new foley.  Today is also our DS's 30th Birthday. He is such a joy to us and has grown into a wonderful caring man.  Gooseberry - body weight exercises are always good. The kind I do when i find a minute or two. The reason i struggle with yoga now is I get into a really good head space when doing a good practice and it's what I'm used to. When I have to get interrupted it really throws me off. It's something I have to get over and deal with. I have a topper currently on my bed but the space I have to trial this in the office right now isn't even twin size.

We started using apple sauce to help swallow the probiotics and it worked within hours.  About two weeks ago she stopped being regular again even with the probiotics. One of our care givers suggested warming prune juice and sending it through the tube. Worked. Had a bowel movement within hours.  We now keep the little cans of prune juice and use about one half a can periodically. Keep the other half in the fridge in a small glass. We throw this away if not used within a few days.

40910,2018-05-22 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Becky I’m happy to hear you are getting into a good rhythm in more ways than one. Once you can spend a good amount of time at home you’ll get into some good routines with the vent and care.  As to the bowel I have found that every so often we have to switch things up to keep Brian even somewhat normal. As Buckhorn mentioned all the “medicines” don’t seem to do it. His body laughed at prune juice and an probiotics. Currently “Natural Calm” which is Mag citrate in powdered form is working. For how long I have no idea. I give him 1-2 tsp in water through the tube each night.  Becky I think you’re doing awesome! And I know you needed those naps after a week without help. I’m happy you could get them in.

40910,2018-05-23 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Tillie you are so right about the rhythm of life. Fighting it only complicates things further. It's far better to recognize and adapt.  As Lkaibel says those naps ARE a gift from God.  Sue I think of you almost every time I sneak in a nap. I wish I could give some of them to you. The mag citrate is an interesting thing. I asked my DIL a nurse why they just refuse to use it in the hospital. She told me it often causes cramping and extreme discomfort. LOL---I can give Matt an entire bottle and have a normal movement an hour of two later.   Ernie and Buckhorn I was giving probiotics but then someone--I think it was Laurie--mentioned possible bad side effects for PALS who may have some infection brewing. That the probiotics would encourage growth of all kind including the infection. So I now have a box of probiotics. Our arsenal continues to grow and I have also found the mixing things up helps enormously.   I thought we were headed back to the hospital last night and I must say I had a terrible response. I am very very tired of that trip. We brought more blood up with the cough assist and suction and he had a slight fever that was rising and he complained of his ears throat and head hurting. Crap crap crap crap crap. So I consulted with Dr. Google who confirmed what the Docs at the VA had said--if it stops on its own there is nothing else to do. Bleeding can be an early sign of pneumonia and one article said that early deaths from pneumonia are often from bleeding rather than inflammation. Other than that unless he's gushing we wait it out. This morning there is no fever and no blood. Lots of secretions even with the scopolamine patch but I'd also stopped the Alka Seltzer (which reduced secretions but can irritate the stomach and cause bleeding--another recent problem) so we're just using the cough assist more and keeping an eye on things.  His lungs have been prayed and ct scanned and all they see is the normal gunk that comes from repeated pneumonias. Other things that an cause bleeding--well I don't think he could tolerate the treatments anyway. He is bright eyed and wanting to get up so maybe we'll be home for a bit longer    I finally got the borders on the quilt I pieced for my niece's wedding which was last May and got it dropped off to be quilted. That will take another two months but it will be beautiful. Another reason he got sick yesterday. I seems like every time I go upstairs to sew something goes wrong.

40910,2018-05-23 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Becky small tip. I always give a fever unless extremely high 24 hours. If it doesn’t resolve I call the Dr. I do use tylenol for comfort with a fever. Also repeating suctioning and/or cough assist can irritate the lung lining and you can see some blood on suctioning. In those cases I tell Brian we are going to slow down with both as he’s just making things worse. As you may have been told suctioning irritates and causes mucous so you can get into a nasty circle.  The best thing in that case is to try and have them wait a little and spread the suctioning out as best you can. I’m sure you’ve been told some of this already but it’s always nice to know that another person has gone through this.  Hopefully he is still awake and you can get his time switched.

40910,2018-05-23 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"Hi Becky Like Sue when there was bleeding I would immediately back off the cough assist and suctioning as much as I could safely until there wasn't any active bleeding. My husband was on plavix and aspirin for multiple heart conditions so he bled easily and as a result we had numerous bleeding events in the airway. I categorized them as ""above the cuff"" and ""below the cuff"". Above the cuff I would first make sure the cuff was up tight to help keep blood out of the lungs  typically they were caused by trach changes ( when he had the Shiley ) or his vent circuit tubing pulling on his stoma. The below the cuff events were usually caused by someone doing too rough or too frequent deep suctioning the hospitals were the worst. After many of these events I came to the point that the law of the land was cough assist to get secretions out followed by suctioning only the trach tube and 1/4 inch beyond its end. Yes I actually measured a trach tube added a quarter inch and figured out what number on the inline suction catheter it equated to. Also insuring his airway was well humidified helped. Wow that was probably way more information than you needed as you probably know most of it. Hopefully this was a one off event for you. One device that I can't recommend enough to anyone home on a vent as it saved us from so many hospital trips  is this sterile secretions collector. We were able to get a sterile sample  run it to the lab get a ""sensitivity analysis "" so the doctor could prescribe the best antibiotic for the given bacteria  all without leaving home. We also had sterile urine cups for the same purpose as my husband was prone to UTIs.",True,KateEmerson,2016-04-23 00:00:00,514,Lost a loved one,2013-09-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Boston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/venting-tomorrow-which-will-surely-cause-more-venting.40910/page-6
40910,2018-05-24 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"I agree that mixing things up (re: the poop-patrol arsenal) is quite useful and helpful. We have used the magnesium citrate as a last ditch effort a few times now when nothing else worked for 6-8 days. I nicknamed it ""the bomb""! Regarding probiotics/prebiotics and intestinal flora I have never read an association with consumption of these and increase infection in the bowel; quite to the contrary I believe. I am obviously not a GI specialist  butt  (HaHa) - what I have been told in the past from MD's is that if you have diarrhea/cramping AND a fever you do not want to take something like Imodium that will keep you from expelling the nasties from your insides. You never want to block your body's efforts to expel infectious ""material"" (ahem) from your body esp. when there is a fever present.  I'm sorry you are conitnuing to have these repeated scares regarding pneumonia/lung infections. It sounds like you are quite informed about how to best deal with it and are doing as well as can be expected. I can appreciate how tired you must be of the repeated trips to the hospital.

43198,2019-01-09 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,"I am by no means an ""expert"" but here are some things I suggest based on the month I just had after my husband was diagnosed in Dec.:   Find a few friends who you can call when you are feeling overwhelmed. Talk to others so you can be strong for your daughter. Let your husband vent to you but also be honest with him about how you are feeling. Use your support system to hold you up as much as possible. Mornings were/are a bad time for me so I set up a daily call with my friend for the first few weeks.   Talk to your doctor (primary care) to get help with sleeping. If you need to take medication to help DO IT. If you need to have a physical have one. If you need help finding a therapist get one. Just like on a plane when they say that if you have children you need to administer your oxygen mask before you can help your child you need to.  If you can take time off from work (if you work) DO IT. Let yourself plan learn sleep read and spend time with your husband and daughter. It will make you feel better to be with your family.   Take car rides to just cry and process (makes it easier to cope at home).  Call your local ALS Chapter (Upstate New York) and ask for help.  Contact Us - The ALS Association Upstate New York Chapter   Talk to your husband's doctors if you think it will help -- Find hope and encouragement where you can. Ignore the people and the things that stress you out and seek out the people and things that make you feel calm.   Decide that you are going to do what your husband needs and give yourself over to it completely when you are ready. It will make you feel in control and that you have a plan.   Hang in there -- I know I sound all big and bad in this post (and bossy - sorry!) but I am still in shock some days. I am so sad and angry that my family is going through this but most of the time I am okay. For now. I did not feel that way a month ago (he was diagnosed on 12/5).

43198,2019-01-10 00:00:00,Just found out - please help.,Thomas It sounds like we are in about the same boat as far as timing We found out at the end of November.  We had the Social worker from the ALS Association over the week before Christmas to meet with us and talk about what they can help us with and give us an introduction. I think the scariest part is you need to plan but you have no way of knowing what to plan for.  My husband has no use of his left arm at all and his right is becoming weak so it is harder and harder for him to do the everyday tasks that we all take for granted. It is heart wrenching to watch the one you love deteriorate in front of you and there is not a thing you can do. My husband worked with his hands his entire life so he is having a very difficult time with it. Luckily it has not affected his lower body as of yet so he is still able to get around. You just have no idea where you will be in one month or one year from now.   I agree with you 100% about taking care of yourself first but sometimes that is easier said than done. My teen age daughter is having the hardest time of all i have reached out to a few people to see if i can find a therapist or someone for her to talk to.  Being a teen age girl is difficult on its own and this adds an element i would not wish on my worst enemy. I have found the shower to be my cry time. I put up the music and take unusually long showers at times but it is needed...  I do work which has been a life saver for us because i carry the health insurance but my husband is home by himself for most of the day which is not easy for him. I am trying to find things for him to do but with his limitations that is not easy. He is also very depressed which does not give him much motivation to do things also. I can not even imagine what he is going through. I am sorry for you also and anyone who has to go through this.

We moved to a new part of the country while my PALS was about 18 months after diagnosis. I left the ALS support group that was so helpful.

47424,2020-12-07 00:00:00,Advice needed,There's nothing irrational or over emotional when one has to care for a loved one and care for themselves. Nothing. Take care of yourself first as if you don't you can't care for your husband. Honest direct conversations are always the best. You might ask your daughter if she can spend more time with her father if she is so concerned. You need time out away from your home situtation. Join some reading group or whatever. Something for yourself so when the time comes you are on your own life still has some meaning. You must keep up your friendships as they can slip away so quickly when we keep to ourselves. I worked in home care for 25 years with MS ALS Cancer and so one. Then my husband got non-hodgen lymphoma and was ill for 5 years before he died. I worked cared for my husband and had 2 teenagers to look after. I now have ALS. So I pretty much know all the angles. If I hadn't had the support of friends I could never have manage. There is always so much more we want to do but we can only do what we can.  I'm in Canada where we have free home care regardless of your situtation so I get almost all the time I need. We also have hospice groups that can offer some hours the ALS Ass. that offers some help and other agencies connected to home-care that can help. Some church groups will also offer support to your self. We also get whatever equippment we need through home-care including beds mattresses lifts and so forth so I do have a hard time understanding why people in the States seem to have such trouble. Take whatever help you can get and if it's not offered do some digging.  I know it's a battle at the best of times but when you get settled into a routine it will be easier on you. As a home-care worked I often had to sit down with the family and tell them what they needed and where to go to get it. So often caregivers get ill themselves and they just can't do it. I know right now no one wants to look at long-term care but sometimes that is what is needed. I'm sure you love your husband greatly but sometimes these decisions must be made. With placement comes all those hours that your not able to do. You can still be there throughout the day helping with baths and so forth. I've sworn up and down to my sons that I will not be going into long-term care but we can't control the future and who knows I just might end up there.

45047,2019-09-20 00:00:00,Barbarassister's thread- new member,"Just a thought: It's important to understand why he objects. It may be something that he and his wife getting to the heart of his concerns may ease his mind. If he has a religious objection perhaps their spiritual leader could help.  Doctors and nurses would see him naked. An employed caretaker bathing him would see him naked. If he doesn't object to strangers perhaps viewing his wife in a nursing role would help. Her wearing nursing scrubs or white jacket during times when caring for his needs may ""depersonalize"" the situation. His wearing ""something"" pajama top or shirt and socks during care taking is not seeing him ""completely"" naked. That may be a workable compromise.  A loving wife of 35 years is not ""looking at him naked"" but tenderly caring for him as she is called to do. Marriage vows often include ""in sickness and in health"". It's difficult for some men to come to terms with needing help. They're supposed to be the strong one.  In any case I hope they can find a amicable resolution. May blessings abound.

45047,2019-09-21 00:00:00,Barbarassister's thread- new member,One of the most difficult things for me living with ALS is loosing control over my body. It’s really really scary. Fortunately I still have control over my mind. But I’ve had to relinquish body duties to others. As the disease progresses this includes transportation bathing dressing grooming toileting speaking (to an extent) talking on the phone writing checks moving my limbs taking care of my dog etc. etc. It sucks! But there’s very little alternative as long as I am alive with this disease.  I’m sure every PALS wrestles with this loss of independence to some degree. Acceptance can be very difficult because it means acknowledging the loss of control and entrusting to others what we would normally do for ourselves.

This disease can rob all dignity but I think that if she can show him that she will help him in a way that truly respects his feelings then he can realise that his dignity is kept after all.  As a past CALS I can only try to imagine what it is like to lose all that control but no matter all the things I did I know that I never fully sat in the shoes of my husband.

Explain your greatest fear. Acknowledge that he does not owe you peace of mind but might prefer it for himself.   There are often several months of denial perhaps more with slow progression so he still has some to burn.

My husband is not on a ventilator but has a trach and BIPAP. He was diagnosed in 2011 and I have been his only caregiver all this time. The last 5 years he has required a high level of care. He was limb onset but now has only some slight leg movement. His speech is no longer understandable but the eyegaze does not work for him.   My husband is also in fairly good spirits and I find myself struggling at this point to try to be even a tiny bit the same for him. He has no plan on ""checking out early"" because some how he still feels his life is worth living. I really can't believe he still feels this way and I do not feel the same way but I am trying to honor his wishes.   The problem is I believe that my husband has developed a degree of apathy and does not see (or care) the toll that this is taking on me. We were both in the medical field and he does not believe that any one other than me can take care of him the right way. I was as totally housebound as he was for many years and started wishing that I would die just so that this could be over.  I started taking an antidepressant which really helped me out of the darkness. I told him I absolutely had to get out of the house for a few hours a week and the ALS Assoc. arranged for skilled nursing for 3 hours one day a week. He still insists that I take him to the bathroom give him his meds and suction him before I leave so the nurse is really just sitting with him and talking to him the whole time but this has helped me a lot. I look forward to it every week.  The other thing I did was join this site which was a tremendous help.

45047,2019-09-22 00:00:00,Barbarassister's thread- new member,I think she will join eventually. I was literally lust telling her how wonderful uplifting and encouraging you all are. My BIL has been a law enforcement officer all his adult life. He retired about 5 years ago. Barbara retired last December after 35 years as a research technician in our local med school. She loved her job but the immediate need to care for her husband forced the retirement. It was not a minute too soon. Timing is everything.   She has said and told her husband that she considers it her PRIVILEGE not her obligation to take care of him. It's with leaking eyes that I can honestly say that she is by far a better person than I.   She has been there for me in all my life challenges from the SIDS death of my daughter in 1977 (lots more in-between stuff) to my husband dying after 73 days from being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia 11 years ago. She was my witness when I married again to a friend from church whose wife passed three months before my husband. She and I together aided our parents 6 years ago as their health failed and they passed 6 months apart. They moved here from Michigan just 2 months before my husband was diagnosed.   So.....sorry to ramble but she and I are a team and so very blessed to have each other. I am going to send all of this to her....or TRY to (lol). I look forward to my continued communication with all of you. You truly are a blessing in our lives.,True,barbarassister,2019-09-19 00:00:00,7,Loved one DX,2017-06-01 00:00:00,US,NC,Winterville,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/barbarassisters-thread-new-member.45047/
45047,2019-09-26 00:00:00,Barbarassister's thread- new member,Again thank you all for your wonderful support. I have shared this forum with Barbara and it has helped her and her husband move forward with discussion and possible decisions as to how to progress with his care and in which direction. She has contacted the folks at our local ALS clinic and run all of your suggestions by them (ie bidet feeding tube hospital bed etc.)   He is now on a total liquid diet. No more solids....too risky. She fixes him protein shakes with milk and ice cream to increase the caloric content. She'll soon be trying different flavor combinations for him such as our seasonal favorite pumpkin spice.   She is looking at the logistics of moving out the queen size bed which they still share and moving in a hospital bed for him and a twin size bed for her. They have to be in the same room or she may not hear him at night when he needs her...even with a baby monitor. If the engineering can be worked out for furniture arrangement (the room is kind of small) he may finally be able to sleep on either side of his body. As it is now he can only sleep on his right side because his breathing (Trilogy) machine can only be on that side. But his right shoulder is beginning to get painful.   They are constantly adapting as each day (sometimes hour) brings changes in his condition. As for the bidet they are strongly considering that and will be consulting a plumber as they consider it further. It does appear to be a viable option. Without all of y'all's help and suggestions they would probably not have either considered these options at all or maybe not be moving forward with those they had already discussed. Thank you again.,True,barbarassister,2019-09-19 00:00:00,7,Loved one DX,2017-06-01 00:00:00,US,NC,Winterville,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/barbarassisters-thread-new-member.45047/
45064,2019-09-23 00:00:00,How are others faring with respirator care?,Thank you Sharon. I feel embarrassed to admit that I have a lot of caregiver help when I see that you are working solo what must be 98% of the time. I am 76 and truly believe I could not do that. Your second and third paragraphs are also true for us. Because of my age I am avoiding drugs and seeing a therapist every third week. The lack of communication and my perceived view of my PALS not understanding my position is very difficult. He also is not sympathizing with the financial worries I have about my own future. The urge for life is so strong that it blinds him to other concerns I believe. I understand and I don't understand. I know that not all PALS take that point of view.  My PALS has set limits on his further treatment which are very strict and he wishes for a natural death. However with his breathing problem solved and with the medication he takes for other purposes a natural death is pretty out of reach. This is a very difficult issue for him and understandably so. It is heartbreaking to see this.  Thank you again for sharing. I respect so much what you are doing and wish you strength.

45064,2019-09-23 00:00:00,How are others faring with respirator care?,"This is a gut wrenching thread. I applaud and admire you all for your honesty and willingness to ""put it out there"".   By coincidence a week or so ago I was thinking of starting a thread about what would happen if a therapy came along that stopped the progression in its tracks; not reversed it but just stopped as is. For early progression people this would be great news; but what about mid and later progression PALS (and CALS)? Could we live with the ""as is"" indefinitely? This appears to be Pinky's situation and as we can see there are no easy answers.  For my own situation my PALS is totally physically immobile. She still talks though softly has started to have difficulty swallowing and breathing appears to be only slightly diminished but still functional. Until recently she read voraciously did word games solitaire etc on her iPad and (via voice-to-text) communicated with her friends. Now she has little interest in those activities and just binge watches Netflix. She says it drains her energy to do those other things. On the rare occasions I can get her to go out of the house 2 hours is the max before she tires and wants to return home to her ""chair"".   Even between us conversations tend to be quite short - she has little interest in sustaining a conversation be it about family her disease or other topics. Since she is C9 some of this may be FTD related - I'm not sure. We are only 2 years from diagnosis far less time than many here but the impact on our lives has been painfully dramatic. Thus it is quite easy for this CALS to empathize with Pinky.

Sharon and Pinky my husband went from being very empathetic to almost none. He did not have FTD. I joined a CALS video support group ( the only way I could "" attend"") and found this seemed to be a not uncommon experience. I initially was very hurt by it but in learning it was not unusual in ALS I added it to the symptoms of this disease and didn't take it so personally which helped emotionally. On the other hand knowing this I felt more comfortable ( less guilty) for doing what I needed or not doing what he wanted to maintain my energy in order to continue to care for him. I knew I had to do this for both of our sakes.  Ken I saw the same changes in my husband but it was for a couple of years before his respiratory failure/ ALS . Previously his mind never stopped reading chess  puzzles etc. Then it changed to only reading books he had already read even only watching programs he had already seen and not wanting to do much of anything. He was not someone to express how he was feeling so my best guess is he did not have the cognitive or physical energy for anything new or demanding. In his case his breathing did not provide the oxygen he needed to do these things and his CO2 was building making him sleepy and lethargic. Because we came into this backwards I don't know if what your wife is expierencing is respiritory based or common in a more typical progression.

45064,2019-10-04 00:00:00,How are others faring with respirator care?,Dear Pinky thanks for this thread. My PALS is not on a respirator but is a slow progressor. There are times when truth be told I envy the CALS of fast progressors. He was diagnosed 4 years ago and I'm told I have a decade or decades of caregiving ahead. Thankfully for now he is very kind and understanding of my needs. We are paying out of pocket for a caregiver and while sometimes he complains she doesn't do much (like Sharon's nurse) but I have repeatedly told him that if she is not here I cannot go out on a bike ride. He is on bipap lately most of the time and I don't know if he will choose to be vented or not. He has been refusing to discuss this or to do an advanced directive as he just cannot face it. Sometimes though he tells the caregiver things that he doesn't tell me so I suppose it is good to have a third party who is neutral.  I don't know if the PALS are experiencing some FTD which affects their ability to empathize or if it is just a matter of being trapped within their own bodies and turning inward. I try to be thankful for every day but really this is so hard and so unfair. As far as finances can you talk to an attorney or financial planner about options? This was on my to do list for this year as well. I guess there is a Medicaid spousal impoverishment provision but honestly it is peanuts in comparison with the cost of ALS.   Wish I could reach out and give you a hug.

He saw himself almost motionless speaking on the screen. It made him sad. It made me sad. He hadn’t realized his physical aspect. I hadn’t realize either I suppose I got used to the changes as they came. I think he still saw himself as he was before he was stranded in his bed. He is in denial. He asks the physio when he ll be able to walk again. It s ok. That is the way he copes. But tonight I can’t help being scared because it s what happened to his wife who died a year and a half ago. I loved her. She held on as long as she believed she would once walk again. When she understood she stopped eating and drinking. At the time I thought that was a clever move. I love her. But now I am afraid he ll do the same. Not logical I know.  I thought I had come to terms with his dying but I am not ready with his suffering or being sad.

He is having a hard time accepting the machines and treatments necessary. Anyway I need to have an idea of when I should start using the suction machine for him?

I am his caregiver and I have real fears about what to expect for the future.

45316,2019-11-04 00:00:00,It's been four years,"Four years now since my husband was diagnosed. He was doing well for the first three years but this has been a difficult year. His left hand is gone his right hand is very weak and he can do little with it. He is also having trouble walking and is on bipap much of the day now. It's hard to see him deteriorate this way. He alternates between sorrow and denial. The sorrow manifests itself in his mourning the things he can no longer do. The denial requires me to make him special foods that he swears will make him well. I've moved him into the bedroom and bought a TV so he doesn't have to navigate the two steps into the family room any longer. It's hard to believe that just about a year ago he did a 2 mile hike in Zion on his own.   My caregiving duties have increased exponentially. I do have a caregiver but when she is not here I spend much of the day helping him. He needs help with a lot of things but so far he can still feed himself although I can see where this is headed too. I assist with all personal hygiene physical therapy and respiratory care while the caregiver is out. We're in the process of getting approval for a power chair building an elevator in the house and I'm looking now at sliding shower transfer chairs after he nearly fell trying to get in to the shower yesterday. I told him no more showers until we can make it safe so sponge baths instead. I'll need to remodel my bathroom after the elevator is done; between our current construction project which I am managing and the power chair and home health visits and respiratory and personal care it's hard to keep up with everything. Seems every time someone comes over to evaluate him they ask me if I've done something else yet (Have you gotten a handicap van? Don't you have ramps? What are you going to do about the shower? When is the elevator going in?) and it makes me feel like I'm not doing enough. Guess I'm not the best caregiver but I'm trying. There are times when I lose my spirit or become frustrated and I'm not good at hiding it from him.   I'm told he has a decade or decades yet. My neighbor said ""I hope it's decades!"" I don't want to lose him but honestly I don't know how I'm going to do this for 10-20+ years. We had looked forward to retiring together and traveling and having fun. Now I'm watching friends do just that while I'm emptying his urinal and trying to make sure he is comfortable.   Honestly most of the time I am exhausted.

45342,2019-11-10 00:00:00,Random Thoughts for New CALS,Hi All  Some will know that my husband passed in March this year a few months short of three years from Dx. I’ve had about eight months to chew on how things went for us and what worked and what did not. We are all individual our situations unique but in the interests of maybe helping someone else I thought I’d post my thoughts.  1. Starting with the emotional side all of your feelings are okay. Mad sad frustrated heck even resentful as long as you don’t take it out on your PALS. If you happen to take it out on your PALS for a minute to lose it a little apologize and move on. You are human s/he’s human and there are no demons or saints here only humans trying to muddle through.  2. A bit more on the emotional side grab your moments. You and s/he live with ALS for often a long while before your PALS leaves this world. Enjoy the football game enjoy holding hands or family or that great day on the deck. The moment is all any of us ever had.  3. On the financial side if your PALS is game do the estate planning early and be done with it. If real estate is involved make sure you get a real estate attorney involved not just an estate attorney. Be very careful of the idea that you don’t need to worry about any of this because you don’t have much or you’re married or whatever. Often times a good estate attorney can help you keep things completely out of probate a gift indeed and a lot better than protracted unexpected legal messes. Also check out no questions asked life insurance. If a PALS lives two years from the time of purchase it could pay out. ALS is financially distressing to devastating. Never be ashamed to think of your financial situation during your time as a CALS. My perspective is coming from the United States I think in some European countries laws Are more clearly for the spouse or kids than in U. S. States but do check it out regardless.  4. Don’t be afraid of exploring Hospice. We made good use of home hospice in our final year. We had many services covered that would not have been otherwise. At the point we agreed no more Rilutek we were ready.  5. This one may be a little controversial but I say accept your PALS choices even if you don’t agree with all of them. If FTD is involved it gets more complicated but In the end it really is your PALS one and only life just my opinion.  6.Be ready to advocate for your PALS with medical professionals. You can end up in the weird experience of looking at Doctors and Nurses who are telling you incorrect things about ALS. You may find yourself in an ER full of medical staff who know less about ALS than you do. I looked at a Dr at one point and told him he needed to consult with Dr. Walk our ALS specialist and that what he was saying was wrong.  7. Accept that very likely many maybe even most of your friends and even relatives will fade away. People will pop up to help who surprise you. Some of the leavers will likely try to fade back in after your PALS passes Kleenex in hand and talking about how it was hard for them. It’s hard not to be resentful but don’t waste your soul on it.  8. The ALS society can be a precious source of loaner equipment. we got so much from them including a smart home setup 100% free of charge. They don’t means test it’s all whats available in your area.  9. Love yourself. For many of us this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to us. For all of us it will be a tremendous challenge. If you are still working at a job never put work ahead of yourself. I worked until a week before my husband passed for people who in the end treated me badly. Don’t do it. Caregiver giving you trouble don’t hesitate to give them the shove off. Family in your face with how you are not doing it right? Shut them down no apologies. Yes they are hurting too but YOU and your PALS are hurting AND working with it so prioritize yourselves and each other.  10. Know you are never alone. Every CALS is with you. That’s not just words. I went to an ALS fundraiser a few weeks ago and here in reserved Minnesota had other ALS widows and current caregivers arms around me in no time.  This may all be worth just what you paid for it. Take what works leaves what does not. ❤,False,Lkaibel,2016-05-09 00:00:00,1467,Lost a loved one,2016-06-01 00:00:00,US,MN,Minneapolis,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/random-thoughts-for-new-cals.45342/

Since she is now less active along with taking in less the time frame is hard to say but it does sound at least like the beginning of the end. Peace of mind and comfort are paramount so whatever provides that from music to softer light scents if she likes and tolerates them to holding her hand gentle massage it's all good. And of course reassuring her that you both are at peace love her and she doesn't need to worry about anything.  As far as your husband just generally anything else you can take off his plate so he can be present for his mom is helpful and later reassurance that he has done his best by her as I am sure you both have.

45212,2019-10-17 00:00:00,Tough bitter sweet day,I'm sorry MarieLaure. I can see that would be hard and frightening.   We can't postpone suffering and sadness forever even if someone is in denial like your dad. Likely at some point as happened with his wife he will want to leave those behind and so now may be a time where you reiterate to him that you support him in how he wishes to respond to his changing situation. You can acknowledge his feelings and the sadness you can remind him that you are there if he is fearful which he well be beneath his stated denial.   As we often say here the greatest gift we may be in a position to give is the physical support for the decision when enough is enough. That is the point at which we must stop being us for a time and be the instrument through which our PALS achieve their final wishes. There is never really enough time to come to terms with that in advance but if you know that you may need to find that resolve you will find it if/when you need it.

45212,2019-10-18 00:00:00,Tough bitter sweet day,I so get it. My Chris was in denial too as well as having FTD. So he would say things like - don't worry xxx won't happen. We both knew xxx would but he would cling to those things.  When he reached the last week of his life after an awful pneumonia and hard partial recovery he said to me calmly - I can see death. I think we both knew at that point though it was a few more days for me to consciously admit this. I then found a huge pool of calm peace. I hope this can happen for you also. It helped me to really give good palliative care and he did not suffer at all those last days. He suffered a lot in the year before that.  You are facing your feelings now this is a good thing as you know this is not easy on anyone.

45227,2019-10-19 00:00:00,When to suction?,Welcome Cass and sorry that you find yourself here. We will help you however we can. It is definitely a moving target to keep up with and it is even harder for PALS to adapt to dependence on machines and other people.   If he is not coughing choking or changing color and feels he got the bulk of the saliva out he probably did. Not everyone needs or tolerates a suction machine so I would not press it now if he's not in distress. Does he have a feeding tube and/or BiPAP?

45227,2019-10-21 00:00:00,When to suction?,Thanks for the welcome everyone and the advice is appreciated. Things are progressing very rapidly. My PALS has almost completely lost his ability to suck up anything. He is choking and coughing a lot! Up until about 10 days ago he could walk. Now he can’t stand. He has using a Bi-Pap at night now if I take it off for any length of time his oxygen level goes to the high 70-80. So I’m not sure how long he can last like this. And everything is declining so rapidly. Is this normal in ALS? I’m wondering is it days or weeks? I need to prepare myself but I’m feeling overwhelmed.,True,cassboyette74,2019-10-19 00:00:00,3,CALS,2017-01-01 00:00:00,US,AR,Mayflower,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/when-to-suction.45227/
45227,2019-10-21 00:00:00,When to suction?,I hear you - my husband was rapid progression and I was just running to keep up! He was gone only 11 months after diagnosis. What about a feeding tube - it sounds like he doesn't have one? This would take away the choking when swallowing for him.  It really is overwhelming when so much is deteriorating at the pointy end. Unfortunately pretty much anything is normal with ALS from beyond-belief-rapid to snail-pace.  We can't tell if he has days or weeks I'm so sorry. This disease is so unpredictable and there are so many things that can affect it all. A pneumonia from aspiration or serious injury from a fall are definite things to now try and avoid as they will of course speed things up more.  We learn to take each day at a time somehow and find a place of realising we can't save them but we can be with them and love them.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/when-to-suction.45227/
45227,2019-10-21 00:00:00,When to suction?,It sounds like he needs the BiPAP full time as many PALS end up. With a nasal mask that is comfortable (I always recommending trying the Circadiance nylon options) that should not be a problem for whatever eating drinking coughing or talking he can still do. Is he pursuing a feeding tube?  To go from walking normally to being unable to stand in 10 days would be pretty fast but I am not sure if that's what you mean.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/when-to-suction.45227/
45237,2019-10-22 00:00:00,How long?,I am so sorry at most 14 days but likely considerably less as he is debilitated. Sometimes just a few days.

45208,2019-10-17 00:00:00,Husband has ALS with dementia,Welcome Debbi sorry you find yourself here. There are definitely others here whose PALS is/was affected by ALS + dementia (we usually shorten to FTD because that is the most common kind with ALS). I am sure they will chime in.   I would certainly pursue BiPAP because it could improve his wellbeing in several ways and probably the sooner you introduce it the more likely that he can deal with it mentally and emotionally.   Just to double-check does he have a Will power of attorney and advance directive in place? And have you two discussed his wishes in regards to the end of life?

45208,2019-10-18 00:00:00,Husband has ALS with dementia,Thank you Laurie. The answer to your questions is yes he does have a will I have power of attorney and we do have an advance directive in place. We discussed end of life with his neurologist about 6 months ago. Due to the level of dementia he does not want any invasive procedures. No ventilation and no feeding tube. I will start the BiPap after our clinic day next Monday. He doesn’t do well with anything “new” and it seems to increase his confusion. Even the walker which we’ve had for 6 months still confuses him. I am just so thankful that he has maintained his normal kind &amp; loving disposition (so far). It certainly helps me to know there are others out there experiencing all this. I’ve felt very much alone.,True,DebbiN,2019-10-17 00:00:00,2,CALS,2017-08-01 00:00:00,US,MI,Benton Harbor,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/husband-has-als-with-dementia.45208/
45208,2019-10-22 00:00:00,Husband has ALS with dementia,Debbi This sounds so much like my husband Dave who also had ALS/FTD. The ALS seemed to move from the head down. It moved from his head to his arms and breathing then swallowing and hands. He could walk a little even at the end but lost the ability to understand language at all. His disposition remained sweet until the end although he was apathetic and lost empathy. But for him it may have been a blessing because he lost the ability to worry and understand what was happening to him. In his normal state he would have agonized over every little change.  I also worried about the BiPAP because pre-ALS he suffered from insomnia and I thought it would keep him from sleeping. But he slept all the way through the first night he had it and never complained about it. The full face mask would give him a sore on the bridge of his nose. We found the nasal pillows worked best for him.  By the time we suspected the ALS he also had the FTD to the point that we never really got to discuss whether or not he wanted invasive procedures. Our family decided to go ahead with the feeding tube but no ventilator. He definitely took an immediate downturn with the dementia after the anesthesia for the tube placement. I'm not sure it was the correct decision but it did allow him to meet his first grandchildren twin girls. By that point he was emotionless and could not understand but I know it meant a lot to our daughter.  Dave lived two years almost to the day of when the neurologist first mentioned ALS as a possibility. Generally the ALS and FTD progress quicker together then if separate.  I went to the ALS Caregiver Support group ever month. I still go. But I know what you mean about feeling alone in it. The other CALS are wonderful caring people. But there was no one there in this situation.  I agree the FTD hurt far worse than the ALS.

45293,2019-10-31 00:00:00,Questions to ask a prospective caregiver,Hi in addition to my family I've been receiving care over the last year from a few nursing students and a local woman ( totals about 40 paid hours split across various days and shifts) . A friend helped me interview and do a demonstration to see how they reacted to the actuality of the work which was actually the most important part of the screening.   Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses but I would try to get a sense of their timeliness and dependability ( have they ever lost a job due to absence or tardiness or for any other reason?). I would also ask what makes them squeamish whether they would object to light housework if they've ever fed or bathed an adult if they like to walk and what they do to keep fit ( it's tiring work) how far they would have to travel and if they have reliable transportation... How well they take direction and receive suggestions   I would ask for relevant work references.,True,nona,2018-10-01 00:00:00,555,PALS,2015-02-01 00:00:00,US,NH,New London,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-caregiver.45293/

45293,2019-10-31 00:00:00,Questions to ask a prospective caregiver,I interviewed people to take care of Fred's mom for end-stage renal failure. Some of the ones who looked good on paper were disasters in the interview. I asked them why they wanted to work in this particular environment. I asked how they would handle X or Y (concerns that could be emergencies) and asked if they had any physical limitations that would prevent them from lifting bathing bending or operating equipment (she was on home dialysis and the setup had to be sterile and took about 10 minutes. I made it clear that when they weren't directly attending to Nellie they would be expected to prepare food do light cleaning and feed the dogs.   I asked each person about their last job and why it didn't work out. I also asked a lot of open-ended questions to find out if they had kids and what they did outside of work.   We ended up with four good ones but one quit after a few months. The other three stayed on and rotated when Fred his niece or I couldn't be there. We had one who was a talker but she liked to cook and clean while she was talking so she was very productive and it didn't bother Nellie.

45293,2019-10-31 00:00:00,Questions to ask a prospective caregiver,I think it's really important to meet the PALS and be watchful as the CALS or friend helping interview as to how they treat the person and how well they listen.  Try to find out (as well as the terrific suggestions above) how they will cope if verbal communication ceases.   Since anyone can be taught all that is needed I think that finding out how they deal with things as a person is the real key. We had one person that really did treat Chris like a child she lasted maybe 3 shifts because we really tried to give her the benefit of the doubt ...  Also try to get a feeling for how well they will respect the fact they are in your HOME. They are not coming to a hospital or just a 'workplace' but into the intimate setting where people actually live.  Chris also did not want people who were going to talk on and on at him all day. He was so frustrated with his lack of ability to speak and limited movement he did not want to be trapped listening and not able to contribute.  Job description is a great thing to have ready as it lays the foundation and gives you both practical points to discuss in an interview.  You definitely want someone who is willing to do anything. As a CALS it was really difficult for me to have people come in and do what 'I should do' so if I had had to deal with people balking at doing anything it would have been crushing for me.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-caregiver.45293/

45293,2019-11-01 00:00:00,Questions to ask a prospective caregiver,Great advice here already. If you are hiring direct do the background checks. I would also ask for references. Can you call their last three employers and see how things went? Also observe how they are with your PALS. I turned down a couple of possibles who actually walked into the house and then into my husband's room while texting.   Strength is important not only for the caregiver but also for you PALS. We had to pass on a couple of people (including one nurse in the hospital) who just didn't have the physical strength so they had to jerk my husband to move him. That was painful for him. I loved having big strong male nurses!!  Have cameras up in his room and in public spaces in the house--including where the meds are. If that's a problem pass. I seldom checked mine--just the fact that I could mattered.   Have a written schedule and list of tasks for them to read. That's the best way to make sure you are on the same sheet of music. Your idea of caregiving and theirs might be different and you need someone who will do things your way. Observe them as they read and ask a few questions about their experience or understanding of the tasks.I f they can't read and follow instructions you may have a problem. Yes invite suggestions but they don't get implemented without your (or your PALS) approval.   Don't get discouraged. We had a nursing agency for 9 months and they were never able to staff us with 5 people at the same time. I rejected more nurses than I approved (with my lead nurse's concurrence). Once you do find good people treat them very very well. They are going to be in your home performing very intimate tasks--if they don't feel like family it will never be comfortable.

Your exhaustion is real and we do understand.   Please never allow yourself to doubt your caregiving. Pushing a PALS to fast to make accommodations and get equipment is hard and some PALS simply won't allow it. I look back and wish that I'd taken things a bit easier. Of course it's easy to say that from this side. Those people who mention things that need doing they are not judging you (or at least they should not be). They are trying to help you since you never know how fast things will move once they speed up. I'm sorry you are managing it all yourself--it can be so very overwhelming.

Stay within yourself do what you can and above all do NOT second-guess yourself.  There is only so much time in the day and you have only so much (mental &amp; physical) energy. Concentrate on the high priority things and don't sweat the small stuff.  Have you looked into hospice care? If your husband qualifies and is on Medicare there is no time limit (just must re-qualify every 6 months and can do so as many times as is necessary). We recently put my PALS under hospice home care and it has had a very positive effect on both of us - much needed help for me and additional professionally-delivered services for my PALS. Plus my PALS gets to socialize/interact with a variety of other people (I'm pretty boring to be around 24/7  ).

When things took a steep slide downward back in March we had to sit down and decide what to do about the house. Our house is constructed on many levels and the main floor is essentially up a flight of stairs from the street entrance. We are on a hillside so the back garden is levels. We thought about moving going back to his condo where he could live on the ground floor buying a new place or staying put. He even told me one day that I could just put him in the garage as if I would even consider it. We ran the numbers and looked at other options and the elevator ends up being less than the selling and paying taxes moving expenses etc.   He is actually excited about getting a power chair so I guess I should be happy about it too. I know it will make things easier but seems like it is one more step toward the inevitable.   Anyone have any advice on sliding shower transfer chairs? He found one he likes but my caregiver reminded me that eventually he won't be able to stand up and we'll need a hole in the bottom. Things you never thought you would have to think about.

V I found that the visiting "" healthcare professionals ""  with a few exceptions  added more to my burden than they helped me or my PALS.

We ended up with a nurse that I asked for specifically as she was very helpful and supportive and an aide.

45342,2019-11-10 00:00:00,Random Thoughts for New CALS,Excellent advice! As always so much knowledge on this forum. It was my lifeline while caring for my PALS my husband.  I am now 2 months out from his passing and still sorting through the practical and emotional fallout. I'm working on finding myself again.  One more suggestion - make sure all accounts are either jointly held or in the CALS name if at all possible. I found out the hard way last week what happens when you don't.   We both used the same major credit card for 25+ years for almost everything. Cards were always issued in our individual names to both of us. I called the cc company to have his name taken off the account. Turns out it was opened in his name not jointly. They shut it down on the spot. Would not transfer it to me. I was told I had to apply online with the generic form. The problem is that I have not worked in 3 years. I left to take care of my DH and do not for one moment regret that decision. We were living on his LTD and SSDI payments. So technically I now have ZERO income. We have money saved but even some of the jointly held accounts are suspended until all the paperwork is done. So what is the chance of me qualifying via an online form?   Luckily our bank was able to get me a card because of our record with them. The agent at our local branch was excellent getting matters there straightened out.  Check and double check ALL your accounts.,True,Jrzygrl,2017-02-14 00:00:00,720,Lost a loved one,2014-08-01 00:00:00,US,NJ,X,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/random-thoughts-for-new-cals.45342/

45342,2019-11-11 00:00:00,Random Thoughts for New CALS,Tillie  We need to consider PALS who don't have CALS when the document is prepared. We have an entirely different situation. Some of us have few if any relatives so we will have to rely on outside care. The finances are different than a PALS who has a significant other or children to whom they want to leave their possessions. Everyone should have a valid Will and also specific directives. Every PALS should find someone they trust to be their general POA and someone else to be their medical POA. These two should be different people for a reason in some cases.   I've been a medical advocate (pro bono) for two people and they really need to trust you. Just bringing up a topic that gets overlooked. I've met a dozen PALS without CALS in my travels and interviews. Some had family members in and out of their orbit and others had to rely on paid caregivers or live in nursing homes.,True,KimT,2014-11-18 00:00:00,4148,PALS,2015-08-01 00:00:00,US,South,The Beach,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/random-thoughts-for-new-cals.45342/

45293,2019-11-06 00:00:00,Questions to ask a prospective caregiver,A followup to this thread...  Everyone gave helpful suggestions. I had put this in the CALS forum at the request of my partner who urged me to “ask (my) forum buddies”. I thought mostly CALS would respond but we had a mixture of PALS and CALS respond.  We interviewed two prospective caregivers this week. One was a gal in her 40’s who had actually worked with a PALS in the past (the PALS was slow progressing and eventually moved out of the area). She checked all our boxes and seemed like a great fit in terms of personality work ethic and experience. We’re having her return next week for a trial run/ training session. She also has a rescue dog and knows a couple other caregivers with ALS experience. Bingo!  The other was a woman in her 60’s whose main caregiving experience has been working with elderly demented patients. She seemed nice (and also has a rescue dog) but.... I’m noticing that this is the skill set of many people who do caregiving including the woman I already have working for me for the last several months. Providing companionship and mental stimulation for an elderly person is very different than the more hands-on procedure-oriented care that ALS requires.  Thanks everyone for your help. Hopefully caregiver #1 will work out for the long haul.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-caregiver.45293/

They came over ready to take blood samples...for a power chair???? I also bought him a frame for around the toilet that will allow him to lift himself up more easily.

We lived on the high side if the street the garage was a level below the main living area. We opted for a stair chair. He actually used it quite a while. When he could no longer use it due to core strength he would ride his power chair down the hill from the back yard. Soon after we moved to one level. That was 2 years after he was trached and vented. We could not have fit an elevator I believe a stair chair is less expensive overall. I hope you’ve investigated that. Depending if he plans to vent he may or may not use that elevator very long.

I'm already starting to remember the strong man I married rather than what ALS did to him. I've found that being around people he knew before is helping with that.

My question is: His personality has changed a lot. He seems to have no consideration at all for my feelings or needs and is frequently grumpy &amp; unkind so much that he is now very hard to live with - is this quite typical?

43607,2019-01-29 00:00:00,Shifting Sands...,"Our journey began at a Joe Bonamassa concert in November of 2012. With no advance warning Darcey was suddenly having difficulty walking. Later that same night she'd be unable to rise from a seated position. It was the beginning of a life phase that neither of us anticipated.   For all of 2013 and leading into 2014 we put life on hold and chased a diagnosis that didn't echo the symptoms that Darcey was experiencing. In the spring of 2014 Johns Hopkins welcomed us into their fold. Concurrent with that Darcey's recoverable CIDP diagnosis was morphed into one of terminal ALS.   Fast forward to March of 2015 and Darcey was given notice that she was likely within 6 months of her life's end. I remember her smiling at the doctor and saying ""Thanks for that heads up... but I've still got things that need doing and simply don't have time for things like dying.""   So much has happened in the intervening years. We battled cancer in my girl puppy (Elsie) and rejoiced in her survival/recovery... only to lose her later to congestive heart failure. Elsie was a ""Daddy's girl"" and was to be my much needed companion upon Darcey's eventual passing. It was extremely difficult to have to make the decision to put Elsie down.   We dealt with Darcey's perpetual and steady decline in function... and I was always the Champion... remarkably able to find new ways to compensate for that which would be forever lost. We took pleasure in watching our son (Jim) find success in Brooklyn NY while we held firm to our home roots in VA. Neither of us anticipated our other child (Connie) moving from a handful of miles away to thousands of miles away.   Darcey had always been vocal about how determined she was to stick around provided her ""quality of life"" (QOL) was good. For a good many years now it has been my greatest achievement to make each next morning worth waking up to for Darcey. And I have taken great pride in my success.   Much of Darcey's day to day centers around her ability to use the computer and to engage in social networking. She has successfully used voice dictation software to control and interface with the computer... long after she lost ability to use keyboard or mouse. Of late however ALS has finally reached its touch to include that safe haven above her shoulders.     Swallowing has become difficult and her voice weakens with each passing day. Recognizing that she might soon be unable to continue her daily use of the computer via voice dictation we sought other avenues. And we were fortunate to have been granted the use of a computer with eyegaze technology so as to continue beyond the loss of her voice.   On this last Thursday the eyegaze computer was delivered and some basic training was enjoined. On Friday Darcey attempted to acquaint herself with it even more. But it wasn't yet set up with her email so she pushed it away and showed signs of depression.   Saturday I spent time getting the new computer set with her Exchange Mail and able to log into Facebook. We'd get past those two primary needs before moving onto Netflix and Amazon Prime. So on Sunday evening I suggested we spend some time on the new computer.   About every 15 minutes I'd go in to check on her. She was writing our daughter an email. I could see that it was going slow... but at least she was moving forward with it. About an hour an a half later I noticed that she was no longer working with it. Instead she was just staring at a blank screen. She asked me to take it away. She then asked me to take of her mask.   Darcey has needed the Trilogy to breathe full-time for several years. The longest she tends to be able to go without her mask is two or three minutes. So when she asked me to take off her mask I told her I couldn't do that. She began a litany of repeated ""take off my mask... take off my mask... take off my mask"". I told her I couldn't do that. She asked why. I told her that it just didn't feel right to do so.   Darcey did not talk much the remainder of the night. When she did talk it was to ask that I take off her mask. On this one particular night I was glad to be going to bed and at least momentarily ending what for me seemed a nightmare.   Monday started with Darcey seeming to be in better spirits. Surprisingly she didn't want to use either computer. She also did not eat anything for breakfast... for lunch... or for dinner. Today Tuesday she repeated that same thing... not eating throughout the day (though she did spend some amount of time on the original computer). Tonight I asked ""is it your plan to stop eating?"" She replied ""I don't know yet.""   Darcey had always said that when she could no longer communicate... or when she could no longer use the computer and interface with her friends... or no longer be able to chew taste and swallow food... she'd be ready to call it quits. It appears that she thinks that she's now there.   I'm probably having more difficulty with this than she is. I feel as if I've begun to fail at making tomorrow another day worth waking up to. On some level I've always known that such a day would come... but I wasn't ready to concede that we were anywhere close to that day... at least not yet.   And so for the moment I wait minute by minute to see where the next moment takes us. Even with this there are still things to feel excitement for. We've had a new baby puppy born to us last Wednesday. Her name is Elise and she is a black &amp; white Coton de Tulear (same breed as was Elsie). Elise won't be ready to come home to us until sometime in April. I remain hopeful that Darcey will want to be around to welcome Elise into her new forever home. Time will tell.   In any case I felt the need to share the shifting sands that are upon us. I've encouraged Darcey to participate with some of the fine folks I've met within the walls of these forums. If you are one of those folks please consider keeping my thoughts private. This has been my ""haven and safe place"". I would appreciate your consideration. Who knows. This may all be just ""one of those moments"" and we'll quickly return to our previous ""normalcy"".    As always My best goes with each of you...

I received this request today and am hoping someone has insight to share. Thank you in advance! ""A few days ago one of her aides identified a possible emerging pressure sore on her sacrum area (like where the base of her spine meets the top of her bottom). Since she’s having more trouble breathing/swallowing she’s sleeping with her head more elevated at night - I think that may be contributing to this pressure point. Regardless she’s starting to call me down to her room multiple times a night complaining of pain and pressure (and in other areas as well - her elbows back all over) and I don’t really know how to help her especially since I can’t identify anything obvious (sheets and nightgown are smooth skin looks fine etc.).

44528,2019-05-31 00:00:00,Moving to Long Term Care?,Hello--this is my first time posting on this forum. My dad was originally diagnosed with PLS about 15 years ago; 2 years ago the diagnosis was changed to ALS. He is wheelchair bound and needs assistance with all aspects of daily living. He has a catheter and needs food pureed. It's very hard to understand him when he speaks. He also seems to be having memory issues and has become very belligerent (which he was before he was sick as well).  He has multiple aides who currently come to the house; someone is there through the whole day except between 11pm-7am. However after all these years my mother is exhausted and we are looking at moving my dad out of the house.  We were told to look at skilled nursing but it's really expensive and we feel that much of the rehabilitative services they offer wouldn't be relevant to my dad as we'd like him to be treated more like a hospice patient at this point (he keeps saying he just wants to die). He also does not want any assistive devices (i.e. a feeding tube) should he need one. So we've also looked at assisted living and memory care but I'm worried that his physical limitations are more than what most people in those facilities have.  Has anyone moved a loved one out of the home? If so where have they moved them and do you have any advice about choosing a facility?

45444,2019-11-27 00:00:00,Longtime CALS first-time poster,Hello everyone  I want to hug ALL of you. I have felt so incredibly alone in my situation but JUST hearing that I am not the only one having this experience has already made me feel better.   My husband is the PALS and has VERY slow progression. Diagnosed in August 2011 and just lost the ability to stand a few months ago (~August 2019). His deterioration started in his arms then REALLY slowly progressed to legs. I express the slowness because it is EXCRUCIATING.   We have 2 boys ages 9 and 11 and my Mother lives with us. Thank God else there would be NO way I'd survive this without her.  I am in weekly therapy monthly psychiatrist visits on various meds to manage my anxiety depression and stress. I've had anxiety for years but it was managed until the past 18 months ish. The intensity of home life along with terrible work stress pushed me to need to adjust meds add new things cut back on other things etc which means I've been struggling for mental stability for almost the entire past year.  I think I'm finally getting straightened out and I firmly believe my husband has changed mentally. He will profess his love and appreciation for me regularly but flat refuses to talk to me about his condition or the future. I have been trying for 8 years to try to anticipate changes and plan for the future but I can barely get him to talk about anything realistically. He also will not do anything proactive. Every major change that has happened we've had to run around frantically at the last minute to get the right machine help adaptation on and on.  He flat refuses to take any antidepressants but he's a grumpy angry jerk to both me and my kids regularly. EVERY time I try to have a conversation about something important or difficult he gets angry defensive and snappy. Then I blow up bc I'm so frustrated and everything deteriorates and we fight and the kids hear and it's just horrible.  Anyway I had never heard of FTD so i'm super grateful to the contributions on this thread. I'll be researching that right away.  I also appreciate having somewhere to say unjudged out loud that I wish it was progressing faster. If he goes at the same pace as his past he will linger around for another two damn years. Our entire household is miserable. We muddle through every day most times it's ok. Sometimes we do have 'good' days. But the layers of complexity stress pressure lack of personal freedom combined with his hair trigger have made the future seem incredibly bleak.  I look forward to getting active in these threads because it's absolutely impossible for anyone to understand how incredibly difficult this is. I am going to need LOTS of support. &lt;3,False,erinhazey,2019-11-26 00:00:00,4,CALS,2011-08-01 00:00:00,US,GA,Alpharetta,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/longtime-cals-first-time-poster.45444/

44805,2019-07-22 00:00:00,My husband,"Welcome kiwi. I'm sorry you find yourself here.  What you describe is pretty common and if you read the Current Caregivers section you will see examples. There are several reasons. ALS affects metabolism so energy that is used even in speaking and sitting (not to mention balancing in the hoist) is a scarce commodity. Processing information and stimuli takes energy too.   Studies suggest that it can be harder to make decisions (loss of ""executive function"") in ALS even if there is no dementia. And of course there are fewer decisions to make since PALS cannot just wake up and decide to do something so the ones that are left can seem larger than they are.   I think that the loss of empathy and personality changes that many of us have seen goes to energy deficit and often some blend of depression anger and fear. Some P/CALS use antidepressants. Others do not.   If your husband has a feeding tube and uses a commercial formula he may be malnourished or in pre-diabetes so blending real food or using a less processed formula such as Kate Farm is something to consider trying.   If the changes are recent or even not and he is not on BiPAP that might be a consideration as lack of respiratory support can cause changes as well.   In a previous thread I described it as when you have a bad headache you want to lie down and rest because you are fighting the pain and it's exhausting. Your husband is living that exhaustion full-time his slow progression notwithstanding.   You ask how others cope. Apart from trying to rule out some of the specific causes as above it can be a matter of waiting out the bad and trying to present choices where there is good on both sides.

44805,2019-07-22 00:00:00,My husband,Hi Kiwi  My husband also had very slow progression. His first diagnosis was in 2011 and it seems like he is in the same physical condition as your husband. I also noticed a change in his personality over the past couple of years-- mostly a loss of empathy for me. I discussed this with him and told him that ALS can do this but he got very angry and denied that he had less empathy for me.   At the last clinic visit we had in Dec. of last year his neurologist told us that more recent studies have found that as many as 80% of ALS patients have cognitive changes. This was much higher than had previously been thought. I told the neurologist that I did see some changes in my PALS but again Frank got angry and emphatically denied that he had cognitive changes The doctor told him that if he had changes that he would not be aware of them and we moved on to something else.  I have felt that my husband has become very depressed and he refused to take any medication for this when I would often suggest this. I emailed his hospice nurse about this and luckily she was able to convince him to try an antidepressant. He has been on it for 2 weeks now and I think I see a slight improvement.  I just want you to know that I understand what you are going through. It is very hurtful when you are basically dedicating your life (for many years) to caring for your spouse and they seem to lack any appreciation for this at all. I try to tell myself that he was never like this before ALS and that it is this horrible disease causing this.  I have come to realize that very slow progression is very very difficult for both the PALS and CALS and not always something to be hoped and prayed for.

44805,2019-07-22 00:00:00,My husband,Hi Kiwi  I can so relate to what you are feeling. I have a thread that is still on the forum but closed. Called “ struggling ”. You can look for it if you dare. My DH was DX in 2007 after 2.5 years of trying to figure out why he was limping. He passed Nov 30. We were in it a long time. Although his last 8 years were on a ventilator.  He too was grumpy and very direct and lacked empathy to a point for me. We did get him on an antidepressant and that did help. Fortunately for me he was already using a feeding tube so at first I snuck it in him. Maybe not the best plan but it did help.  One thing to remember is with any antidepressant it generally takes them 6 weeks to get fully on board so if you go that route and haven’t already don’t expect over night miracles.  I have to agree with Sharon on the slow progression. Not always a blessing or at least a good portion of it is not.  Please know I’ll keep you in my thoughts  Hugs,True,Narrowminded,2016-04-30 00:00:00,2740,Lost a loved one,2007-07-01 00:00:00,US,PA,Pittsburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/
44805,2019-07-23 00:00:00,My husband,&lt;quoted text removed&gt;  Hi Sharon Thank you. I have felt that the slow progression is very difficult too - I had set up a local support group 4 years ago and my husband was the earliest diagnosed in the group and is the only one that is still surviving (even though we have had new members in between). The other spouses experienced a short sharp period of stress and challenges then the grief of the loss but have come to terms with it and are now moving on with their lives.   I have been living with increasing stress and emotional pain (and I am not in any way minimising what my husband is coping with; it is just that I feel at the moment that I am hanging on by my fingertips so am trying to find a way to get through this) and there is no end in sight.   He is frequently angry and unkind to me; yesterday I took a much needed day off work so I could treat myself to a massage lunch with a friend and do some relaxed shopping and when I got home he was in a rage with me for not having spent my day off work with him.   I reminded him that I had a day off a couple of weeks ago which I spent with him all day taking him out for lunch but he seems to think he has the right to control my whole life. This is the type of incident that happens quite a lot.   Some time ago he tried to ram me with his power wheelchair and I barely got out of the way before he would have smashed my legs against the door. I feel scared of doing things that might upset him yet I can't give in to all his demands otherwise he is controlling my whole life.  He is no longer under Hospice care - they discharged him because he isn't dying quick enough to meet their criteria so they offer no support whatsoever. He won't take any drugs other than antibiotics when required and would not even consider anti-depressants. He frequently tells people that he has never had a 'down' day since he was diagnosed but he sure has had a lot of angry ones.,True,patientkiwi,2019-07-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2013-07-01 00:00:00,NZ,SI,Invercargill,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/

44805,2019-07-23 00:00:00,My husband,Kiwi - Tillie aka affected has a link in her profile to a very good article about FTD. I’m not good at linking things like Laurie is so maybe she will come back and do that too. I really believe you would benefit from reading that article.  Another suggestion and I see you are in NZ so not sure how things work there but could you call his Dr when you are away from home and explain what’s going on. Then have him make a suggestion even calling the drug something other than what it might be. He may be able to get your husband to take something. Maybe anti depressant isn’t even the right med but he might have something for aggression he could suggest. Does your husband have any trouble sleeping? Maybe the Dr could say it’s to help with sleep or something like that. I hate to go around our PALs backs but some times desperate times call for desperate measures at least at first.

My greatest fear at this point is that this will continue for many more years and I don't think I have anything left in me to be able to keep caring for him. I have been caring for him by myself for all these years and it is taking a toll on my physical and emotional health.  My husband has never been physically aggressive toward me but then again he really has no ability to do so. I face the anger and loss of empathy for me. I think the anger has been better since he started the antidepressant. He does seem to reserve the anger for me and the hospice nurses think he is a great guy who is handling his disease so well.

FTD is associated with the personality and behavioral changes you mentioned kiwi. It can also be associated with changes in or loss of speech that isn't related to muscles but rather to the brain itself. FTD may occur in about a third of the people with ALS but there are other changes in thinking and behavior that are milder and more common as well.   Unfortunately there isn't a cure for the FTD any more than for ALS but some CALS here have seen positive changes in their PALS when using antidepressants.

So I asked her if she would prefer that I not ask until she was ready to begin eating again. She then let me know that she was ""done"" and had no intention of ever eating again. I offered to call in hospice so she could take off her mask and not have to worry about ""air hunger"". She said that she didn't want hospice... and that she hoped that she'd be gone... or near gone... in about a month.     She went on to say that her decision was because I didn't have the time to take to sit down with her and to help with the new eyegaze computer. Wow... I don't know when I've ever had my legs swept out from under me quite like that remark did. I thought about defending my current lack of time... but some part of me believes that she needs an excuse to support her decision. And if that is so the last thing I'd want to do is to take that away from her. It still hurts like hell though.   Between us I have been busy. I still run my own company. Some time ago I moved the business home and am now the only employee... but that just means I no one else to share work load with. Although I'm not taking on new clients my existing client base loves me and keeps me quite busy. I somehow ALWAYS manage to get the client work done. But I'm two months behind on invoicing... and i simply can't let it get any further behind. My clients while appreciating what I do for them (and do in a most timely manner) are not apt to make payment until they've been invoiced. Imagine that! It is also tax time. I've a number of things that need doing before the month of January is done (in fact I just tonight completed those).   Time is my most precious commodity. I don't complain about it (the lack of it) to Darcey as I haven't wanted her to feel that she was a burden. She takes Lorazepam at night to help her go to sleep and to stay asleep. That has worked well for me. I get her all tucked in and then I crawl into bed. Thirty minutes later she's in dream land and I get back up. I'll walk downstairs and get another two or three hours of work in. I try to call it quits by 3AM so I can get a few hours of sleep in before it is time to start that next new day.   Tonight I'd just like to call it an early night and put us both to bed. But I have an onsite visit tomorrow and still a few hours of prep work to be ready for it.

She could still change her mind -- or she could again ask you to take off the mask yourself after a dose or more of lorazepam. Or she might want you to ask the question yourself for fear of burdening you.  Only you know what you are prepared to do but it might be as well to think on that.

B you may want to have a look at some of our  recent threads  on positioning support in bed. ALS changes the anatomy and we weren't designed for immobility so the body needs more help as ALS progresses.

44549,2019-06-03 00:00:00,Pain relief for pressure points,Nona it’s true that an NSAID such as Ibuprofen can be used in combination with Acetaminophen. They have different mechanics of action so the combination can be quite effective.  We used to view Acetaminophen as being without stomach irritation but have since come to realize it can sometimes bother the stomach. So when it is combined with an NSAID there is a bit more risk for gastric bleeding. Just something to be aware of.

44528,2019-06-01 00:00:00,Moving to Long Term Care?,I am sorry you are facing this decision. Are you in the US? It is helpful to you and us to fill in the geographic information as these things vary by location. Someone may even know your area!  Assuming US it sounds as if he is way beyond assisted living in his needs. The nursing homes here ( Massachusetts) usually have an acute rehab floor and another skilled floor for people with chronic high medical needs. They also usually have a unit for people with high care needs and less skilled needs. The latter is somewhat less expensive  I know someone who moved to a nursing home after her needs became more than her family could handle. She had no behavioral issues to complicate things and no feeding tube at the time but it was a nursing home not assisted living  It is expensive and a hard decision but people do it.

45444,2019-11-28 00:00:00,Longtime CALS first-time poster,Hi Erin and welcome. I am so happy you have joined us because my husband was also diagnosed in 2011 and was very slow in his progression.   I have posted before about how slow progression isn't always a blessing. I also fear that this may go on for several more years and I really don't have the physical or emotional reserves to continue this for many more years.  My husband also would never talk to me about his disease or funeral plans. I have had to make all decisions without any input from him.  I could see that he was depressed starting this year although he always denied it and refused medication. He is on hospice now and I asked the hospice nurse to talk to him.

45420,2019-11-24 00:00:00,CALS Concern/help,I'm so sorry about your dad's diagnosis.  His sadness is pretty understandable as he is rapidly progressing. He may have some emotional lability and this is really distressing when the person can't control their emotions.  Becoming very isolated with bulbar issues is also really common. Does it help him feel a little better for a while when you bring food movies and organise gatherings? One thing to remember is that ALS causes enormous fatigue so try not to overload him or do too much in one day or he may take several days to get over it. I think that being with him is a really good start. How does he communicate - you say he has lost his voice.  I am sure you will get lots of support here as well as practical tips.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/cals-concern-help.45420/
45420,2019-11-24 00:00:00,CALS Concern/help,If the crying is due to emotional lability (sudden mood changes) rather than depression Nuedexta would be worth a try -- it addresses this aspect of ALS. You/he can discuss this with a physician who can write a prescription if indicated.   But whether you are together at home or elsewhere as Tillie says just being with him is worth a great deal to both of you.

45420,2019-11-24 00:00:00,CALS Concern/help,The very first thing I would do is find out if his crying is from emotional lability or depression. It could be a combination. There is nothing wrong with a PALS taking an antidepressant. I take Remeron and it helps me sleep stimulates my appetite and prevents me from becoming depressed.

In general we spent time where he was most comfortable. If he did not feel OK in a place we would not go or we would leave. We went for many walks in the sunshine listening to birds w. him in the electric wheelchair. Towards the end of the walk he would drive it full speed in our cul-de-sac and leave me behind   his hair would fly and there was a big smile on his face. Later on he lost his neck strength and that all became more difficult to impossible.  When he cried I encouraged him and said for example ""There's a lot to cry about. So many losses. Just cry and you might feel better afterwards."" This would happen at home... not in restaurants though. And it was not emotional lability. If anything he laughed more easily and readily. It was contagious.  People are different ....- for me cheering up did not work - it cost too much energy and I felt fake. I knew I could not fix ALS and not the sadness or maybe even dread that comes with all the losses. I hoped it would be OK to be sad with each other too. I found out it was totally OK.

44805,2019-07-23 00:00:00,My husband,Welcome Kiwi...my PALS is also a slow progressor. At the beginning of March this year his condition deteriorated quickly and his neurologist thought he showed signs of FTD. He was uncommunicative and sullen. The neurologist prescribed a high dose of antidepressant which frankly seemed to make him frantic. I cut the dose by half and that seems to be OK for him. His mental state improved greatly when we started bipap. In my opinion he definitely was affected by CO2 buildup - many of the other threads here confirmed some of the other symptoms he was having.   I agree that slow progression is not always a blessing and don't know how I'll get through 10+ years of this. Several of the CALS who I started with on this forum with have lost their PALS and have moved on but I'm still here. Trying to be thankful that for now he appears to have stabilized again somewhat - we had a lovely 3 1/2 years before things reached this point. He can walk with a walker (though his left foot is going) can still feed himself and can speak clearly unless he has had something very cold to drink.   I dread the thought that he will no longer be himself at some point. Increasing stress and emotional pain...yes I agree...but your PALS' anger toward you is really hard on you. Can you get any kind of caregiving support? I found that having a third party here (friend or caregiver) helps me a lot because it puts a third person in the mix. He will do things for others that he might not do for me. Hope you can get some help.

44805,2019-07-23 00:00:00,My husband,I totally hear you patientkiwi. Anyone who has not been through the extra hell that is FTD will say all kinds of things that we know shows they have no idea of what it is to live with. If these rages were not part of your husbands previous character then I would suggest there are behavioural changes indeed caused by fronto temporal degeneration. This is a very deeply distressing thing to go through and I still find it difficult to read clinical things written about it as they don't even begin to address the reality of living with it. I am not allowed to link to the information I provide on this inside a thread. However if you go to my profile you can find your way to it I hope as I have written extensively on FTD and living with it on my site. If you build up enough posts to private message here too I would happily talk to you as often it is very confronting to say in public things that are going on.

As to your last post I am very sorry that you are dealing with rage and aggression. Is there anyone that he trusts that might speak with him?

He is so totally opposed to any form of medication (other than antibiotics when he needs them) and I don't know if that is the issue so don't want to raise what would be an ill received topic unless I feel that is what may be the answer.

40910,2018-06-02 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"So much has gone on that I think I'm way behind in catching everyone up. Last weekend one son his wife three grands and two dogs visited. Friday night I had a nurse so all but Matt went out for a boat ride. 10 minutes out my DIL started having an anaphylactic reaction to something she drank and we had to rush back to the house and ended up calling an ambulance for her (after almost tossing her into my bed and stringing the nebulizer across Matt to her to start treatments on her). I picked her and my son up a couple of hours later.  On Saturday while we were all out on the water and Matt was with the nurse he had a nasty mucous plug. I found out when I got back to the dock and saw an ambulance in the driveway again. His nurse bagged him for 3 and a half hours (ambulance crew was out of their depth and the RT at the nearest hospital had to ""think"" about it before taking over). He cleared but Xrays showed what looked like a large pneumonia so we transferred to Duke (local hospital had no pulmonologist and Duke has the best transport around).  At Duke we started int he mICU because there were no beds in the pulmonary unit. After one doctor refused we got another to do a bronchoscopy. They sucked a bunch of muck out and took fluids for culture then moved us to the pulmonary floor. The next day the VA (right across the street) had a bed and they transferred us there for continuity of care since Matt gets his long term care there.  We are now in the MICU at the Durham VA. Sometime last night he was switched from oral (tube) antibiotics to IV because the cultures done at Duke show a couple of nasty bugs. Now we wait a couple more days for the sensitivity tests to determine that we have the right antibiotic. They are talking about a pic line as he will need a longer course.  The has been exhausting but the nursing agency that the VA pays for has sucked up the expense of sending nurses to relieve me in the hospital so that I can rest. I am SOOOOO fortunate.  Other progress that we've made: After three rounds of Ileus treated in hospitals since going on tube feeds I bought Liquid Hope myself and it's fantastic. No more bloat no more pain in his gut no more diarrhea and his bowels are moving on their own while laying down (we've had to suspend him in the sling for three months to even get liquid to squirt out of his backside). Yesterday he had 5 normal movements. His brother told him he was full of sh*$ and apparently he was right. The nutritionists are no on board and are working on getting insurance to cover it. The VA requires that we try another whole food version first so we're pursuing both avenues.   The pulmonary folks are working on getting Matt a vest.   Endocrine is moving him back to the U500 insulin since he takes so very much (yeah!).  We are getting a prescription for Mucimist which is working very well in his nebulizer to thing the gunk.  And here's the coolest even if short lived thing:  Last night he had trouble breathing so was bagged again for a few moments before he settled down. They did an EKG and his heart is fine and there was no muck in his chest so they think maybe he had an anxiety attack. Shortly after something shot down his right arm. He said it felt like a pressure cuff had been inflated. Right away he was able to squeeze his left hand again. If we pick up the arm he can wave the hand up and down. He can also move his left arm again. This is beyond weird and I have no expectation that it will last long but he was able to squeeze my hand again last night.   We are also able to leave his cuff down longer and he talks up a storm. Maybe having his lungs cleaned out is helping with that.  I've had a couple of breakdowns this past week but they are very very short lived. It's like I just don't have the energy to cry so after a moment it all drys up. I feel like a ping pong ball but thee are so many blessings in all of this that I can only be grateful (when I'm not numb).  I've been told by several people that the first six months or so after being vented can be rough but that if things settle down we may have more time. I still believe that that more time is coming and the smile that lights up Matt's face more and more often now seems to validate that feeling.  Now if only I could find an accessible motorhome to rent. One that has a lift and and a hospital bed in it. Wouldn't that be great? We could travel again. It's not going to happen but a girl can dream.

It probably had a lot to do with being in the other room but also that DD is feeling better. It's a good thing too because today my Dad is having his thyroid removed due to cancer.  I am fortunate that due to the ALSA grant I had already scheduled a nurse for today. She is coming at 12 and staying until 8. Surgery is set for about 4 and we need to be there at 2. It should take 2 hours. If need be DS can come relieve the nurse until DD gets home from work. My brother and SIL will be there too so my Mom will have lots of support today and hopefully my Dad's mind will be eased as well.  Always something to keep us on our toes.  Since I have some help coming this morning DD's BF's Mom who comes for about 2 hours on a Wed here and there and the nurse coming at noon. I will leave his bath for the nurse Jami can sit with him this morning and I want to work on cleaning out the desk of what i can to prep it to use more efficiently for sewing. It needs decluttered anyway so what a good excuse. Plus that will make it ready to move.

So if one has the finances and the will/strength/perserverance to make something happen AND in the case of PALS/CALS if both want to do something and have the finances to make it happen - go for it!

I know I can't do this on my own for the simple reason of w/chair to airplane seat transfers. If I can some how enlist some friends to do the trip with us then I am sure we could do it. I am just not sure of the emotional impact of going as Kauai was our special place ......... we have been there many times and have done exhaustive hikes throughout the islands. IDK what I would feel like myself (if I put myself in Dave's shoes) to go there just to sit out on balconies and look at life from the shoreline ........ that was never our thing! That said we have some  young  friends that may be up for the challenge if Dave wants to go. From the onset Dave and I decided that we would not pursue miracle cures etc. but rather we would pursue travel exploits as much as we can. We are both of the opinion that ""you can die anywhere"" so with ALS there is kind of a weird freedom in not caring where this happens. I hope this doesn't come across wrong or too crass but - we know ALS is ultimately a no-win situation so our stategy has been a ""full-steam ahead and damn the torpedos"" mentality!

We've done trips to CA and then stayed overnight and gone on the next day. I'm sure that is what we would have to do in our case as the trip is just too long to accomplish in one day now.

40910,2018-06-12 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"Hello again. Believe it or not we are still at home!!  We ran out of Liquid Hope so I did some blending and tried DiabeteSource on Matt again. The formula immediately made his stomach started to bloat. Last night we started getting pushback through the tube so all the milk based formulas are in a stack by the door waiting to be picked up and donated to someone who can use them (our nursing agency does than and it's so easy...). The Liquid Hope arrived and the VA is sending another whole food formula for us to try.  I think the antibiotics have finally turned the tide with Matt's infections. His blood sugar has dropped from the high 300's (and that's with the U500 insulin) back to great levels (actually had a 78 and it scared the hell out of me). The drop was immediate not gradual. Wow.  Buckhorn we think alike. I could have lost him years ago and I know that I will lose him so if he goes out doing something he enjoys I'm ok with that.  Matt's great fear now is suffocating. A couple rounds of air hunger and one mucous plug has convinced him that that is NOT how he wants to go.   All about the motorhome idea. I wish we had considered that before buying the van we have now. It's a Dodge Ram ProMaster 2500 that has a VERY nice conversion. A large lift leather interior Tv in the back etc. After paying for that one I'm just not going to do the motorhome. I'd LOVE to rent one and I see some for rent but I'd need a hospital bed in it and a ceiling lift/track. Sigh. The lack of available travel/lodging that is appropriate for our advanced PALS has me considering turning our home into an accessible B&amp;B at some point in the future. If I can resist the urge to have everything even remotely connected to ALS removed immediately I just may move myself upstairs and make the first floor available to people who really need the ceiling lift hospital bed space for family and access to the lake. Some days I think I'd like to do that and other days I want to never think about ALS again when this is over. I think maybe I'll need a wee bit of a break....  Note to PALS---while you might want to go to a bar where everybody knows your name (Cheers reference for the young ones among us) it's not a good sign when you are greeted by name all the way up the hall when you are being wheeled through the hospital...   Oh I contacted our local EMS yesterday. It seems that our county has professional crews covering most of the county but we are in an area covered only by volunteers. Our county contracts with another county to provide ...(at this point my head was spinning). Long story short the Chief in the area that dispatches to us agreed to put a sign in the dispatch area and a note in the computer to take Matt to our choice of local hospitals instead of the one they are normally required to take us to in an emergency. There was some hesitation until I told him that the RT at the hospital ""needed to think about the situation"" for 15 minutes before taking over bagging Matt from our home nurse who did it in the ambulance because the ambulance crew was out of their depth.  I couldn't get him to acknowledge that one ambulance crew might be better than another but I do now know to ask that a paramedic be dispatched in addition to the EMT.   Off to print new signs to hang in the bedroom....  Oh and my go bag is finally complete. Two pairs of yoga pants 5 long sleeved knit tops because hospitals are cold a weeks worth of undies and socks toiletries and a week's worth of my meds. I feel like I'm back in the Air Force on mobility. I even have a care plan for my dependent (our dog).   I love you all.

39014,2017-07-13 00:00:00,Struggling,Well never made it to the desk and yesterday was rough. Dads surg got started over an hour late. Finally saw him at 10 PM and he had lots of pain. We left so the pain meds could kick in and he could rest. Finally got in bed about 11:30. Mom called at 12:30 moving him to ICU with difficulty breathing going to intubate. Brother taking her. He texted me about 40 min later off to surg again to fix a bleeder and clot. So at 1:30 AM i was back at the hospital. Once they got that done he was intubated and sedated. Both good things he's shown increasing dementia and needed the time for swelling to go down and to heal a bit. He's 82. Back home and back to bed about 4:30 AM. Back up at 7 to give Brian his meds food etc. Mom came home with me this time as my brother was being a real crab and we sent him home.   When mom got up got her breakfast and called to check on Dad. He was doing ok and had rested due to the sedation. Bro and SIL picked mom up about 1 or so and went over to the hospital. I'm headed there when DD gets home and she wants to come back here for tonight again.   Depending on how long they keep him I told my mom is she feels she cannot handle him while he heals a few more days that they should come here. She's definitely concerned and my bro doesn't think it will be an issue. He's not seeing reality. However I told her it's her choice whatever she decides. I also told her though don't let anyone push you into a decision. She said that my dad will want to go home. I told her I don't care if he won't let you buy a certain kind of cheese(yes this happens) that's fine but when it comes to safety of both of you you need to put your foot down. My mom has never stood up to him he's not mean or anything but what he says goes. I told her now that he can't remember 5 seconds ago she needs to take control. Not sure she will at 80 and nearly 60 years of marriage she needs to step up but it will be hard for her.

39014,2017-07-14 00:00:00,Struggling,Well my dads confusion really went overboard last night. They put his bed up against the wall and had a slide board blocking the space between the rails. They had mittens in him because he kept taking his gown off. The nurse sat in the room with him most of the night. Well just before morning she got up and headed out of the room looked at the monitor as soon as she got out and he had climbed over everything and was now on the floor. They did a head CT and he is fine. I suggested a posey (vest that ties him in bed). He has a sitter in there all day. He was not trying any of this when we left yesterday. They tried Ativan since he was agitated but no luck with that.   My brother and mom are there now I'll be headeding over when DD gets home. I just hope all the anesthesia and sedatives can clear his system soon. He is having trouble as noted above but the anesthesia made it worse as it's known to do.   The good news is due to the clot he had they will be keeping him for a while. The issue now is feeding him more than dextrose. They were unsuccessful at inserting a PICC line and they don't want NG due to the swelling from the surgery and his want to keep clearing his throat. I told my brother the PEG isn't a bad option as it doesn't have to be used if he gets back to eating however the thought of another invasive procedure right now isn't thrilling either. Maybe there will be some kind of decision when I get there.

44826,2019-08-03 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,Thanks for all the kind words. OK I'm going to vent now. I am dealing with a number of injuries...multiple bruises on my arms legs shoulder and chest (shoulder strap) tweaked back stiff neck and likely small fracture in my sternum. Dealing with multiple calls from various insurance agencies including my own adjuster who wanted me to tell him what the other car was or get the information from the police (it was white as I recall...then I was taken away in an ambulance). Is that not your job? Oh and the cat scan on my neck in the emergency room also showed a growth in my thyroid so let's add another worry to my ever-growing list. Going in next week for an ultrasound on that.  Yesterday I spent the day taking my bike to the bike shop (needed help loading and unloading it) in my PALS' truck that he never let me drive before and then picking up a rental car among the other CALS duties. The bike is damaged and all of the carbon components will need to be replaced but I'm hoping the frame is OK. I won't be able to ride it for a while anyway. Then the sprinklers broke and I had to call someone to come and look at them. Of course the minute he came over they started working again.  I was thinking if I wasn't a CALS that my husband would probably be taking care of me. The rental car clerk asked my why I wasn't at home resting. Should I explain it to you? Last night there were only 2 wakeups so I guess that's better than most nights. This morning I got up made coffee and breakfast for my PALS served him breakfast (he can still hold a fork and eat for now) got his vitamins moved the bipap into the TV room and set it up cleaned the hoses made the bed cleaned up after breakfast did the nasal spray and the cough assist and gave him a bath. After bath lunch. Then I paid his bills and did his deposit slip; I'm off to the post office and bank next. Then it's ROM and then dinner. He also has been somewhat more critical of late as well guess I'm not doing everything correctly. Thankful for pain pills.  I guess I should stay off Facebook right? I looked this morning and got a notice that I had been mentioned in a post. The post was from a woman who hasn't been in touch in 9 months at all but she and her husband came over on Thursday to visit my PALS (not knowing I had been in an accident) and brought dinner. I appreciate it but honestly let's now get on Facebook and talk about how my husband needs help now and congratulate ourselves for being so giving???? I suppose dinner once in 9 months is helpful but I am the one who is doing everything.   OK done ranting. The accident injuries will heal. Hope the thyroid is nothing.

44826,2019-08-03 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,"V  Completely empathize with your predicament. This type of situation is ever present in back of every CALS mind: who will take care of my PALS if I am out of commission myself?  During our (now) 21 month battle with this disease I myself became a patient at the Mayo Clinic not once but twice. In 2018 I was referred there for a possible sarcoma in the rear of my abdomen; fortunately the biopsy was negative. And then at the beginning of this year I was again referred to the Mayo for possible multiple myeloma; after extensive testing it was determined to be MGUS an asymptomatic form.  The anxiety level and thought processes go into overdrive as one contemplates all the scenarios and possible outcomes of being laid up and unable to care for our PALS. In football this would be called ""piling on"" and subject to a 15 yard penalty - unfortunately the only penalty assessed here is on the victim not the perpetrator.  At a recent local monthly ALS caregivers luncheon a CALS mentioned that she had signed a ""retainer"" with a local home health care company; in the event of her becoming incapacitated the company would step in and perform a specified set of CALS duties for her PALS. I imagine there are different levels of support you can ""retain"". I meant to look into it but haven't.  I hope you find the strength and perseverance and get the support you need to get through this. For sure all the CALS here are with you in spirit.

And yes it helped many this week and will help many in the future should they find your thread.  I’m praying your bike is a somewhat easy fix at this point.  And yes the grandstanding is something I don’t want to get into either.  Ken - that healthcare retainer is unfortunately only as good as the agency is at retaining staff that is trained. If the nurses have not been out to be trained to the particular PALs it’s not worth a lot. Add on the fact of nurse call offs and not having anyone available.... I could make the list go on and on.

44826,2019-08-04 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,V I pray for a speedy recovery from your injuries and that your thyroid lump will be benign.  We CALS get no break from our caregiving responsibilities when we are not feeling well. I badly injured my foot last Thursday and am having a lot of pain when walking.

44826,2019-08-15 00:00:00,In sickness and in health,Update...I went to have the thyroid ultrasound and biopsy. The endocrinologist told me that 40% of people have thyroid nodules and she didn't see anything she was really concerned about. I'll have to wait 2 weeks to find out for sure but I suspect it is benign.  I'm still suffering from pain in my fractured sternum from the accident. Thought it was subsiding until I had to cough this morning. Coughing and sneezing are agony.  Went to pick up my new car from the dealership last night and there is a ding in the rear passenger door. My PALS told me not to take the car. So once again I am driving his truck around until they resolve it.  The contractor was here yesterday and started the process of clearing out space for the elevator. My neighbors who are selling their multi-level house told me they wish they had thought of an elevator instead. So I suppose it will be fine in the long run as well as for now.  Meanwhile time unfortunately marches on. My PALS' right hand is ever weaker his gait is becoming more compromised as his left foot drops. He has an AFO but does not want to wear shoes around the house. He also doesn't like it for the few steps we have to reach the bedroom. He complains of being tired all the time and needs his bipap more and more. I'm still planning to do the Yellowstone trip with him...he said not to expect much and I don't. If he just wants to sit and watch Old Faithful that is fine with me. I am bringing his portable DVD player and his collection of guy movies in case he just wants to laze around and watch Rambo for the 108th time. Anyway I am having to come to terms with the fact that I'm going to lose my husband and it hurts far more than anything.

43860,2019-03-11 00:00:00,How are you?,Tillie  Yes and no. DD2 often will sit and talk with DH for hours. She'll help him with moving around getting things for him and eating/drinking. She also helps with things around the house and errands. But DH will only allow me or his aide to help with any dressing personal hygiene or stretching/ROM exercises. I also handle all morning and night time routines.   I'm OK with that. She and I are going to go get her car worked on and have lunch out while his aide is here tomorrow afternoon. I miss having solo time with my kids so I'm looking forward to it.  Night time is still our biggest problem. Last night he was somewhat crooked in the sling when I put him in bed - my fault. This led to him not being completely centered in the bed - always a sore spot with him. So I got out the slide sheets and with considerable effort got him centered. But not without his criticism when things didn't go perfectly. Once centered we then continued with the rest of the nightly ritual of taking meds stretching getting the iPad positioned so he can read headphones for music and sound blocking heated corn bags on his feet trilogy and bed adjustments. I was a sweaty mess by the end of it last night. I said something about needing to simplify the bedtime routine and he scoffed saying that then he wouldn't get what he needs.   So I will take what I can get for now and just keep putting one foot in front of the other.

It's frustrating when that routine doesn't work. I so get it.  I remember when I had the broken toe one night it took over an hour to get Chris just basically set up in bed. My foot was throbbing and so I begged that I just needed to go sit down 5 mins then I would come back and finish the rest of the routine. You can imagine how well that went down.

43860,2019-03-16 00:00:00,How are you?,"The ups and downs continue.  The day out with DD on Tuesday went well until I got home. DH wanted to know all the details of the car repair. I had dropped DD off at the shop in order to get home on time for his aide to leave. It didn't go over well when I didn't know everything she had done. Our kids have started ""adulting"" and handling things on their own as much as possible (they're in their 20s - 2 in college 1 graduated and working). Car repairs would have been one of the areas DH usually handled. I know the loss of control gets to him. He calmed down a bit later when DD got home and talked to him.  Meanwhile DS called and said he had a last minute invite to go away on his Spring Break so he will not be home this week. Again I'm OK with that. I'll miss him but have encouraged them to live their lives and try not to be weighed down by our situation.   MIL made plans to come for lunch on Wednesday. That went OK but DH said he was exhausted afterward so he was a bit cranky.  Thursday was absolutely beautiful here so I decided rather than run errands I'd spend some time outside while his aide was here. I took the dog for a walk in the park refilled the bird feeders and cleaned up the yard some. Loved the feel of sunshine and fresh air again! DH came out for a bit and directed a bit more yard cleanup then decided it was too cold and went in again. End of my day outside since it was time for his aide to leave. He  can  be alone for a while but doesn't like it so I have decided it's not worth the aftermath.  Yesterday I convinced him to get outside again and it was good. DD left to go back to school.  Bedtime continues to be my biggest problem. I'm up earlier than he is because I a little bit of time to myself during the day. Once he gets up I'm on-call. So by the end of the day I'm falling asleep sitting up and he's not ready for bed yet. Once he's ready we go through the night time routine. It takes between 45 mins and an hour to get him settled - usually with some sort of issue to be solved. Once he's in bed now I'm wide awake. Sometimes I can unwind and fall asleep. Other nights like last night I toss and turn all night.

I would be so exhausted and yet so wound up I wouldn't get to sleep til late and then wake tired.

43860,2019-03-17 00:00:00,How are you?,Jrzygrl - yes that nighttime routine can be a killer. Not sure this will work for you but what I started doing was have my phone go off about 45 min before I hoped to go to bed. I would start his ROM exercises empty the urinal fix the food pump those kinds of things and save his actual settling to last. I also would give his meds then and it would help him start to tire. By the time I was done he would usually be ready. If he questions just stay you wanted to get some of the stuff out of the way but you are NOT putting him to be yet.  I need that warm sunshine too.

41449,2018-05-25 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,That's pretty much what we have in Germany too. ALS here is not equal to financial ruin just lots of burocracy. I find the emotional side hard enough to deal with and have the highest of respect for CALS in other countries who have so much more to deal with.   Last fall I wouldn't have dreamed about stopping to work to care for my boyfriend. I thought we'd have it covered with nursing services. Well turns out that's not really how life works. At the beginning of the year I got out of work to care for him reading social benefits but no salary for six month. Now I have quit my job and will be unemployed. I'm not too scared because there is a safety net here and I tend to be lucky. I feel like someone will create a job for me once I need one. Bit of naivety never hurt.

44646,2019-06-20 00:00:00,"20 Months into ""It""",Twenty-months into “It”. “It” being a metaphor for the ALS experience. Twenty months seems like a fairly long time but for this CALS it has gone by relatively quickly. I think the pace of change has something to do with it.  The shock of the initial diagnosis traveling for 2nd (and 3rd) opinions getting financial and medical affairs in order communicating with and managing family expectations digesting all of the information incessant research on the web (looking for that one piece of information to give hope) going to clinic participating in research studies and a clinical trial understanding and anticipating the progression . . . living the progression!  Living the progression – that has been surreal. The almost instant change in how we live our lives and look at life itself; how priorities change relationships change and life plans change. One day we’re both on a typical retirement glide path and the next we are plunged into the ALS abyss. Of course this is not unique to us; it is a characteristic for all who are members of “Club ALS”.  Living the progression – things are never static for long. First the loss of hand strength then arms and legs/feet; an AFO for drop foot. Mobility - first a cane then a walker then a transport wheelchair then a power wheelchair. In the bathroom – grab bars a raised toilet seat with handles a static shower chair – she can toilet and bathe herself – but then she can’t; so in comes a commode and shower chair on wheels with cut outs for the caretaker to clean her private parts. At this point in the journey the inability to dress bathe toilet brush teeth feed oneself and simply move from point A to B. All of this coupled with bouts of fatigue on a daily basis.  These “inabilities” eat at the moral fiber of the PALS and cascade over the CALS like a never-ending rain. But we persist because we must. Our minds are intact; we have wonderful children and grandchildren great neighbors and friends. We cherish the relatively brief episodes of mental and emotional joy and use them as motivation to “carry on”.  The “It” journey is not over. We’re twenty months in and breathing speaking and swallowing are functional. There will be more “progression”. You might think that by now we’ve mastered the “progression experience”. Not so. It’s sorta like compound interest – each successive loss of functionality builds upon all the prior losses exacerbating the impact. So we will steel ourselves for the road ahead and do the best we can to make a go of it. We’ve definitely been blessed with excellent medical and emotional support – we don’t feel alone in all of this.  Thanks for listening. Writing this has been somewhat therapeutic for me; I’m not sure it will be of value to anyone else.

44646,2019-06-25 00:00:00,"20 Months into ""It""",Ken I love the metaphor of compounded interest. It's so very very true.  Our journey lasted 5 years and change happened at varying rates. It seemed like the first two years sped by just as you described--research participate prepare the house get affairs in order. I often wished we could just get it all in place so that we could LIVE some of the time we had left. Eventually we did.   My savior once my husband was freed from the monster has been our dog. I hesitated when Matt said he wanted a dog--more responsibility I thought. I cautioned him to avoid Beagles if he wanted a dog to snuggle with him all day but he fell in love with her at first sight.

It is considered ""curative"" rather than ""palliative"" and they don't get enough money to cover the costs or deal with the workload. There is a pilot program in Medicare hospice for curative + palliative treatment but PALS aren't eligible and few hospices are participating anyway.  Treatments have placebo effects so if someone is comfortable using Radicava and is not ready to stop they are not ready for the hospice mindset. If/when a PALS enters hospice a different set of goals is in play. Some hospices and health systems offer ""palliative care"" as a bridge between ""normal care"" and hospice.

He did not need or use trilogy/BiPAP very much until he was rather close to the end. He never wanted a feeding tube. He never experienced a plateau.  Usually he could predict which abilities he would lose next. His lungs / breathing was the one area that was not affected too much.  Once his ability to swallow was too compromised the decline became more rapid. He would feel too much discomfort swallowing something like ensure plus as it caused too much mucus in his throat. Then he only ate what he liked and could swallow which was very smooth soups but they don't have many calories (dairy / cream did not go well either.) He could not keep is weight up he lost more abilities faster. Eventually he could not swallow at all.  The decline was breathtaking in the end.

44714,2019-07-06 00:00:00,Is there a rhyme or reason?,Karen my PALS is a slow progressor and was in pretty good shape for 3 1/2 years. Suddenly in March he progressed very quickly. He was walking independently before and even playing pickleball. Now walks with a walker tires easily and for a while would not eat much. He had the same issue with bile said food did not taste good. We put him on Prilosec and that has helped a lot he gained some weight back (because we were feeding him high calorie foods 6 times a day). His appetite is better. Bipap has helped him immensely and I think he has hit another plateau. Everyone is different though. And you are right there is no answer.

44714,2019-07-07 00:00:00,Is there a rhyme or reason?,I am always concerned when anyone says 'progression tends to be xxxx' because the only predictable thing I have ever found about ALS is how unpredictable it is. Yep there are often a group who can say it was this or that way and they seem similar. But to take any set of similarities and try to predict what will be for anyone is impossible. We only find similarities when looking back.  This is why trying to organise as much in advance as possible is wise then just living each day as it presents gives the best way to find joy in each day. I'm truly sorry we can't give something more concrete but we can walk along with you.  FWIW my husband probably progressed really slowly for a couple of years with symptoms we barely noticed. Then things got a bit faster as the bulbar issues started. Then it went wild and he was gone within 11 months of diagnosis. We never had a plateau I just ran like the clappers trying to keep up.

44714,2019-07-07 00:00:00,Is there a rhyme or reason?,We were probably further on the other end of the spectrum than Tillie. Looking back I think there were small insidious symptoms we never realized were symptoms at all. Then he started limping and that started the progress. I guess for a while you could classify it as slow because it took us 2.5 years for a DX. Mostly due to Brian “not having time for that”. After DX it was 3 years until he was trached and vented. He was in a WC w/in 2. Years of official DX. Once trached and vented things slowed a little again. We spent 8 years in that state before he finally succumbed to ALS. My guess is he would have gone 8 years earlier had we not vented.  There are others here who had more good years before vents and very short time on the vent. It’s never the same for anyone unfortunately. I so wish we had answers or timelines to give those that follow but we don’t. So as the others have said just enjoy every moment you can.

The doctor tells me that his progression is on the rapid side of rapid progression and gives him 6 months to a year ( I think maybe sooner than 6 months) The only body part he can move now is his head but his neck is getting weaker. His voice is so bad he has to really push to get the words out. He has a Tobii communicator but chooses not to use it yet. He spends all day in the bedroom in his chair with the bipap on.  This morning he told me his head is getting hard to hold up and we need to do something about it. It is affecting the one last thing he can do for himself the ability to control his chair. When we do a transfer his head leans bad. To compound things he is very claustrophobic will not wear the neck brace. The only time I can get him to wear it is when we are in the van going to appointments.   Sorry for the rant so here is my question. I have a feeling this will be a near impossible thing to do but what are my/his options to keep his head upright and still be able to hit the pads on the head array to control the chair?

45316,2019-11-10 00:00:00,It's been four years,I contacted the Gleason Foundation as we heard that they have some product that was very customizable. We got a truly amazing response. They sent me the kind of measurements they needed. I measured everything and sent pictures of the bathroom/shower. We needed to measure my partner and eventually I got a call and emails from a nuprodx (?) representative and they put a sliding shower chair together that had head support foot and armrests and could tilt - could be used as a commode too. It was similar to the 'shower buddy'. The Gleason Foundation covered everything.

45293,2019-11-07 00:00:00,Questions to ask a prospective caregiver,I've got everything crossed for you Karen. We had some awesome paid carers and I've remained good friends with one of them.  Now some tips for you - always make sure your CALS welcomes the person warmly.  I had a communications book - just a blank book and I would write in it anything significant that happened overnight or any changes in progression. (you and I can think of it like nursing notes - date name and notes)  Each staff member had to read it on arrival and write at least a short note at the end of the shift. Keep a jar with quality lollies in it beside the book with a label - please enjoy whenever you need a lift. (or something similar and pithy)  They also had a chart to note what peg feeds he had and fluids but this is because he was notorious for refusing feeds and fluids but then saying he had them (FTD is a barrel of fun). So that really helped all of us as some days when I had my full day out there could be 2 caregivers doing a shift each so it always meant we had a handover.  I also had a plastic sleeve folder with instructions and locations of household items and I used lots of photos. As things changed I could just change a single page. This was particularly important for us because Chris could not speak so it meant staff did not have to keep asking me things. Staff could easily train each other with this and as we had several different staff and some of them only came weekly it really helped them. Our staff were working full time and caring for several different people each day as they may do anything from 1 - 4 hours at each home. So remembering all the bits when you come weekly was difficult!  All our staff remarked to me after Chris died that coming to our house felt like coming to visit a friend not like coming to work. They found the extra effort to keep them informed made a huge difference and allowed them to feel they were a part of the situation not just someone coming in for a shift.  Pick and use anything from that which may apply,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-caregiver.45293/page-2

44731,2019-07-08 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,I would appreciate any advice or input re: the following.  All of a sudden today my PALS had 2 incidents of urinary incontinence where I was unable to get her to the bathroom before she let go.  As background she is on riluzole amytriptyline for sleeping through the night (since December) and started taking oxybutynin cl er (5mg) before bed for overactive bladder (early June). Up until now the oxybutynin has significantly reduced the number of daytime bathroom trips but today the veritable flood gates were opened. Can't think of any significant change that might have triggered this.  Also she is in the 4th month of a clinical trial and she tries to stay hydrated due to the number of blood draws required (e.g. 5 in 1 day last week).  We're going back to the Mayo tomorrow for a follow up (and another blood draw) and will discuss with her doctor but thought I would ping the veterans here for additional info.

I’m not good at linking things like Laurie is so maybe she will come back and do that too. I really believe you would benefit from reading that article.  Another suggestion and I see you are in NZ so not sure how things work there but could you call his Dr when you are away from home and explain what’s going on. Then have him make a suggestion even calling the drug something other than what it might be. He may be able to get your husband to take something. Maybe anti depressant isn’t even the right med but he might have something for aggression he could suggest. Does your husband have any trouble sleeping?

44725,2019-07-07 00:00:00,New member looking for support,I’ve never joined an online forum before. But I’m scared heartbroken angry unsure..... I could be here all day listing the feelings I have. My husband is newly diagnosed. His problems started in February and in June they sent us to an ALS clinic which is how we figured out what he had. A letter telling us to be at this clinic to meet a team of drs. We were still hopeful that it was just another round of tests.  We had two weeks to pretend before the dr took away the rose coloured glasses. They are going to start him on meds. At first they said it was to soon but a week later they said because it progressed so quickly from February..... What does that mean exactly? At the moment he has numbness in his fingers and foot. Leg twitches and aches. Can’t tie his shoelaces has taken some bad falls.... his Job is walking. He is a line locator. So he’s walked miles and miles every day. Even with the brace he struggles. He won’t be able to work once winter hits. He barely got thru the last one.  So we are selling our house and moving closer to family and god forgive me but I love my job and having to give it up when I’ve worked so hard and put in so many hours to get where I am and to have to give it all up feels like a double whammy and I wonder will I find another job where I have the freedom I have here to do what he will need me to do and the same support from my boss and staff... and I feel guilty for even feeling like this when he is going to lose so much more.  I have read so much about the disease but have no idea what to expect and how long it takes to get to the point where he won’t be walking and there is no guide to this and I already feel overwhelmed and we’ve only just begun.  I feel like I’m standing on a ledge and just need someone anyone to tell it’s going to alright. That we will get thru this. Friends and family don’t understand they ask me if I’m ok and I want to scream I’ll never be ok again. I’m dying inside and I feel so selfish for even thinking about what I’m feeling because of what he’s feeling. He’s the one that has to go thru it. How do I help him. How do I tell him it will be ok when I don’t believe it myself?  What a way to introduce myself to you all. Forgive me for sounding like a crazy person but I feel like a crazy person. I can’t sleep I couldn’t tell you the last time I had a meal. I’m wound up so tight that I feel like any moment I am going to implode.  I came here to find someone who understands what I’m feeling.

44731,2019-07-08 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,My first thought also would be to rule out a UTI. Assuming no UTI if she is post menopausal sometimes vaginal estrogen cream can help.  I’m starting to have the same issue with urge incontinence if I don’t get to the bathroom on time. I can hold it normally until I’m upright. Then watch out! I know my pelvic floor muscles have weakened and I’ve lost my ability to Kegel. I’m assuming it’s from ALS because it’s really only been a few months.

Good point - they had to put her on an IV last week due to trouble finding a good vein.

44731,2019-07-08 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,Hi Ken one outlier possibility is CO2 retention.   Strangely high CO2 can also increase the frequency and urgency of peeing. Our very expierenced RT said excess CO2 goes into the blood stream mixes with water in the blood and forms carbonic acid which the kidneys have to filter out which stimulates the bladder. Probably more info than needed but I've always been someone who asks how or why. I will say that before we knew my husband was going into respiritory failure he was distressed over having numerous episodes of an urgent need to pee at night.  The increased hydration or UTI is more probabable but with ALS it's always good to keep an eye on symptoms of increasing CO2.

44731,2019-07-09 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,For what it’s worth my DH lost the ability to hold his urine. It was all directly connnected to ALs and the weakened muscles. Then he ended up with urinary retention as they weakened further and needed an internal cath. Just another one of the joys of ALS. Hoping it’s not that yet and what the others have mentioned is the cause but something to keep in mind.

When I met with my neurologist I mentioned some twitches/pulsing associated with the sphincter muscles and he said that while total incontinence is rare there is usually some level of sphincter dysfunction with ALS though resistance remains.   I too have been experiencing the same issues. When the urge hits beeline it to the toilet. This began occurring before I started on Riluzole last month so I suspect it is not related to the drug. I could be wrong though and would love to have others weigh in.

44731,2019-07-09 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,Kevin you’re correct. Anal sphincter can be affected by ALS but incontinence doesn’t generally result. I looked up reported adverse effects of Riluzole and urinary (or fecal) incontinence is not listed among them.   Bladder emptying is a mixture of voluntary and involuntary muscles and it stands to reason that ALS might affect some of the voluntary control.

I have been caring for him by myself for all these years and it is taking a toll on my physical and emotional health.  My husband has never been physically aggressive toward me but then again he really has no ability to do so. I face the anger and loss of empathy for me. I think the anger has been better since he started the antidepressant. He does seem to reserve the anger for me and the hospice nurses think he is a great guy who is handling his disease so well.

44805,2019-07-24 00:00:00,My husband,vltsra said:    Welcome Kiwi...my PALS is also a slow progressor. At the beginning of March this year his condition deteriorated quickly and his neurologist thought he showed signs of FTD. He was uncommunicative and sullen. The neurologist prescribed a high dose of antidepressant which frankly seemed to make him frantic. I cut the dose by half and that seems to be OK for him. His mental state improved greatly when we started bipap. In my opinion he definitely was affected by CO2 buildup - many of the other threads here confirmed some of the other symptoms he was having.   I agree that slow progression is not always a blessing and don't know how I'll get through 10+ years of this. Several of the CALS who I started with on this forum with have lost their PALS and have moved on but I'm still here. Trying to be thankful that for now he appears to have stabilized again somewhat - we had a lovely 3 1/2 years before things reached this point. He can walk with a walker (though his left foot is going) can still feed himself and can speak clearly unless he has had something very cold to drink.   I dread the thought that he will no longer be himself at some point. Increasing stress and emotional pain...yes I agree...but your PALS' anger toward you is really hard on you. Can you get any kind of caregiving support? I found that having a third party here (friend or caregiver) helps me a lot because it puts a third person in the mix.

44805,2019-07-24 00:00:00,My husband,Kiwi - at the bottom right of each post is a like button. You can just hit that to thank someone. No need to reply to each and every post. Use this page to pour out your feelings like you have been doing. Many or sometimes no one will reply right away with support. Since we have all been there none of us expect a direct reply. We know how busy it is and crazy and you catch when catch can.  The discussion is good. I had many of those with my DH over the years. Sometimes for me they were effective for a few days sometimes not at all and other times longer. Don’t be upset if he gets angry about just having the convo. However make sure you start things with “I” as opposed to “you” which will make him defensive. Such as I am feeling overwhelmed with all I have to do taking care of you and work etc could we please figure out a way I can best help you so you are comfortable. As opposed to You are making me so overwhelmed I don’t know what to do and your anger just makes it worse.  I hope this helps. And again no need to reply directly to me. And also the forum suggests keeping quotes to a minimum as some are using eyegaze to navigate here and it can make things difficult. We are all aware of what you might be addressing.  Hang in there you can do this despite what you may feel like. I had those same feelings and so has every caregiver on this forum. However you will make it.

This is a good place and people here will understand and help. There is no guide to this. I often wished for 'road maps' for orientation and to know what would be next. The first few weeks and months were the worst. The ALS diagnosis was a big shock for us. Most of what we thought was 'our life' and 'normal' changed quite dramatically. It's a lot to digest and will take a while to settle.   We kept reminding each other about 'one day at a time' - that's all we could manage.  We moved too - to a one level home. We had the ALS social worker for our area (we connected w. her through the ALS clinic) check the house and confirmed w. her that the house was manageable for later stages w. ALS too.   We often played catch-up with abilities that had fallen away as ALS moved on. Shoes w. velcro - then it was hard to put on the socks... different socks... then more help putting them on and the shoes too. Eventually house shoes no more socks. Many many more changes.

People here are going through parallel versions of what you and your husband are going through and we get it. It sounds like you have to deal with some fairly large decisions and changes up front re: work. The physical changes of ALS don’t come all at once so you have some time to adjust unless progression is extremely rapid.  Everyone’s course is different though there are some similarities. I am leg-onset two years ago and I can still walk a tiny bit in the house with a walker. When I was diagnosed two years ago I was certain I’d be in a wheelchair within several months but the time course didn’t play out that way. All you can do is prepare for the future but live in the present and cherish what you have.  I can also tell you from the standpoint of a PALS that you as a CALS are going through this too and your fears and feelings do matter. ALS is a family disease.  Emotionally it’s very hard in the beginning but a lot of that levels out over time and you and your husband will find moments of joy and ways to continue to love and support each other.

44725,2019-07-07 00:00:00,New member looking for support,&lt;quoted text removed&gt;  Yes it is a life-changer for sure. My hubby was diagnosed in March. We're still in the stage of finding out who the people in our life are there for us and who are fair-weather friends. And that's okay not everyone is cut out to be a rock when you need it. And the people who are asking if you are okay don't know what to say or do either. I have found it helpful to tell people what's going on coworkers for example. Sometimes they can help you in small ways like covering for you if you need to do to appointments with your husband.   Try not to keep it bottled up inside. I went to doc for something for anxiety because I would wake up with my heart racing every night. Seek out support groups in your area and on line. Facebook has several very supportive ones. It's hard to say goodbye to the life you and your husband thought you were going to have but my husband and I have such a special bond and closeness since his diagnosis that it's one of the changes that is not all bad. I wish the same for you.We have met some very nice people on our new journey. Our priorities are different from before. We live for now. Take heart in that even though the first few weeks of this are tough dealing with the devastating news of an ALS diagnosis there will still be love and joy in your life.

44680,2019-06-27 00:00:00,Lightning speed,Hello universe. I’m a woman in my 30s currently living abroad with my wife in her 40s who has become a pALS after being diagnosed in January this year. Since then we’ve moved through canes walkers manual wheelchairs of varying degrees to an electric chair. Also the associated shower toilet and other paraphernalia. We’ve also moved out of our house which had stairs into temporary accommodation and now an apartment. Just this week we’ve also been schooled on ventilation which is also now required (Trilogy). In only 6 months this has gone from being a minor irritant to a whole project of its own. I’ve managed to cope with all sorts of mobility adaptations but confess to being entirely overwhelmed by the idea of being responsible for assistance with ventilation. How do CALS manage to adapt over and over and over again? Any tips?!,False,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/lightning-speed.44680/

Ken CO2 retention is measured by an arterial blood gas lab test which can be a somewhat painful stick if not done with lidocaine. You can google symptoms hypercarbia or hypercapnia.

44731,2019-07-10 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,Typically PALS are not getting ABGs done since they are invasive as you point out Dave and there is little point. There are handheld CO2 meters in some clinics but symptoms and other history usually tell the tale. The action step for a high CO2 level is optimizing BiPAP settings (or getting it if you don't have it unless you have opted out). And there is never any reason not to improve the settings so you don't have to wait until any kind of formal statement about CO2 levels is made to revisit respiratory support and sleep positioning.   If/when you have done absolutely everything possible with respiratory support and secretion management then high CO2 would herald the end of life but I don't think anyone on this thread is at that point.

44731,2019-07-11 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,Post urology visit update: After an extremely thorough interview and examination including a stress test leak test (cystometry) blood test and microscopic urinalysis the Mayo doctor said she had bacteria in the bladder but otherwise no other significant issues. He doubled her oxybutynin dosage and once they typed the bacteria would issue a prescription for an antibiotic. The 2 bouts of incontinence were likely stress incontinence due to her hydrating for the clinical trial blood draws. There have been no repeats since then. Follow up visit scheduled for 3rd week in August.  PALS was relieved to have a conclusive analysis/diagnosis. With all the uncertainty surrounding ALS progression she/we didn't need the added issues of urological concerns.  As additional background over the last 9 months PALS saw 2 different   local   urologists (without positive results) and while each did some form of urine analysis neither came remotely close to the comprehensive examination she received at the Mayo. I was present for all examinations and unless you experience it first-hand I don't think you can really appreciate the qualitative difference.

44805,2019-07-27 00:00:00,My husband,"Thank you. Today I had the discussion with my husband. It did not go well at all. Basically he told me that he believes that because I am still working full time in a job I enjoy and that keeps me mentally stimulated and also gives me a wee bit of 'social' time in that I can chat with my coworkers that means I don't want to be with him. He isn't sure whether he still loves me.   When he has gone into respite care in the past I have always visited him once during the week and he has never mentioned this before but he thinks I should visit him daily and because I don't that means I don't want to be with him. Usually I am so exhausted that when he goes into respite I need to just have some quiet time to myself and if I visit him daily then I wouldn't get that time to relax. Everything I do that means I am away from him for a few hours or longer means I don't want to be with him - in his eyes.   He doesn't think I do much at all in the way of caring for him because his carers ""do it all"" - they do an awful lot because he is hoist for transfers and needs 2 people to get him up showered &amp; dressed and put him to bed etc but I also do a lot to look after his day to day comfort and needs when they are not here and overnight as well as at the weekends. Not sure what to do. Very hard to struggle on when he is so totally lacking in empathy that he cannot even try to see things from my perspective.   I have often tried to imagine myself in his shoes and try to look after him the way I would want to be cared for but obviously I'm not meeting the grade in his eyes. He said if I went away (this was his idea not mine) he would manage because he would just buy takeaways for tea and even though he cannot get himself out of his lazyboy (he sleeps in one because it is more comfortable than a bed) he would be perfectly fine in the house on his own at night. I don't want to give up work for a number of reasons yet it seems that is the only way he would be happy even though I won't be.

44805,2019-07-27 00:00:00,My husband,Were you able to read what I have written about dealing with FTD? This is all completely typical - it really hit me because I could nearly quote this stuff verbatim. Again anyone who has not dealt with FTD will never understand what is being said to you and how it affects the relationship - it is far beyond someone 'taking it out on the one closest to them' and far beyond 'being depressed' and far beyond 'dealing with a terminal illness'. I am so sorry you have to cop this on top of ALS. My Chris was convinced that he was not 'high care needs' because he could just manage some standing transfers during the day. Therefore looking after him was pretty easy. If you can find a way to step back from it all and begin to understand how the disease process is working in his brain it won't stop it hurting but it will help you not buy into the discussions and work to keep his quality of life as high as possible regardless of what he flings at you,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/page-2

But I still love him and I couldn't do that anyway in reality. I will take up your suggestion of noting things down. And I really relate to what you mentioned about others just saying stuff like ""oh they always hurt those that they are closest to"" - which to me was just a brush off that trivialised what I am experiencing (my GP did this to me when I was in tears in her office recently - she meant it kindly but it was not helpful).

After the 'discussion' we had last weekend when my husband made it very clear that he hated me going to work I have not mentioned my job at all this week and he has been calmer and easier to be with. It does mean I can't share the funny things that happen in my day too which I find sad because we used to be able to share everything and support each other through everything.

44805,2019-08-03 00:00:00,My husband,Kiwi I’m happy you found something that for now is giving you at least a little cooperation from your husband. Could be he resents that you can leave the house and that you have to be the “breadwinner”. Might be a hit to his ego. Even though you both worked before he could still feel like the breadwinner when working. Plus it does take you away from him and he may be very scared when you are not there so blaming you work is and getting mad at you for having to go there might be the only way he knows due to FTD how to deal with it.

Our apartment doesn’t have suitable bathroom facilities and we rent so can’t make structural changes. We’ve been quoted for a fancy tilting shower chair and ramp to get into a raised shower area. All of this sounds wonderful but how does someone shower if they already need their ventilation support (Philips Respironics) almost 24/7? Is it stressful to be in a shower even if the chair works well? We have cover for the shower chair but are wondering if it will be the answer so desperately sought.

I'm sorry that both of you find yourself here.  Blackeyes everyone has given great advice. We moved coast-to-coast for the same reason and so I know it almost seems unreal for this to have to happen. No longer having ""a job"" (though being a CALS is the most important and challenging role you will ever have) was a wrench for me though I squeezed in some freelancing publications and volunteerism. Be open to whatever paths show up.  You will get through. As others have said there will be times of joy and peace and times of anger depression and loss -- often in the same day.  As to others' questions we had a  thread  about this recently -- my response to all casual questions was ""It's a progressive disease"" and people can Google it if they want. Others had different responses. You don't owe anyone War and Peace when you don't feel up to it. There is no way they can really ""get it.""  As to your question you don't have to tell him anything like ""it will be OK."" You can let him see that you feel all the emotions without being overwhelmed by them. You are still in the first month after diagnosis -- don't hold back with each other but you also both have to know that there is a forward path as you are already doing. Actually making a big decision like that so early shows that you are more organized than we were.  You can focus on the move getting it done with minimal angst try to harvest jointly the good parts like being with family as fully as possible setting up the new home and including things that are important to the two of you while you select/establish care with the new clinic and as he sees your doing that with him that will be part of the cues he takes as to what life will be like what he can still experience and achieve.

A lot of the expenses people incur with ALS are covered by your provincial health plan. Get in touch with ALS Saskatchewan. They have a wealth of information and some equipment can come from the loaner closet. The ALS Canada website is also useful (als.ca). You are among friends who have stood where you are and know lots of tips and tricks to make your journey easier. Feel free to ask anything and everything somebody here has been there too. A lot of bad things are coming. They aren't all happening today. Focus on today and what you can still do. And DO IT!   You are in a bad place we've all been there. You will go through grief long before he's gone. But as things go on and you aren't quite as spun as you are now you will come to realize you are still the same people you were before all this happened. Take strength in that. You both have a wealth of life experiences that will stand you in good staid.

We are 5 years in and when we were first diagnosed ( I say we as even though he has the disease ALS impacted us both and changed our lives forever) I had no idea how we could handle this all I can say is 5 years later it is one day and sometimes one hour at a time. Getting something for the anxiety was a help for me because the information you will receive is like drinking from a firehouse.

No one can tell you it will be OK but I've gotten so much information and support here on the forum. Do NOT feel badly for wanting support for yourself. You are not selfish. ALS affects both the PALS and the CALS we also have to give up things we love and dreamed of to care for our loved ones.

I keep thinking how on the airplane they always tell you to put on your oxygen mask before you help others. I know you will hear ""take care of yourself"" but you will need to find a way to do that.

44680,2019-06-27 00:00:00,Lightning speed,It seems the change never stops. Acceptance allowed me to stay sane—there is always another change around the corner and you can’t prepare for all of them.

Is your wife looking at a trach and vent - I'm not sure if you are asking about the transition to 24/7 care on a vent or the current transition to using bipap a lot. My husband refused bipap and we don't get to choose vents in Australia in general but I sure know that it was constant changes every single week for us.

44680,2019-06-27 00:00:00,Lightning speed,Thanks everyone. It’s so lonely sometimes it’s comforting to know that there are a few people out there who have an idea about this stuff. We’ve had a hospital bed for over a month now and a lift for 6 weeks or so too. Many things have been rented/loaned for a deposit so that’s something. The Trilogy kit just seems new and scary compared to all of the devices for moving around.

Depending on how much volume she can muster you could also position a baby monitor with audio sensitivity turned all the way up close enough to where it alerts you based on a change in volume.

44770,2019-07-15 00:00:00,Tilting shower chair,We showered my husband while using the Trilogy non-invasively and as a vent with a tracheostomy. After watching our very experienced nurses handle the vent I was eventually able to move and shower him by myself with the vent on. I think the hardest part is transferring a PALS while hooked up to a vent--we had a ceiling lift that made that easier. I assume you are already doing transfers so sling that vent over your shoulder as you roll him into the shower. Then sit it somewhere protected from water (we had space to sit it on it's own chair. You'll want a hand held sprayer which you can install in a rental. Tilt him all the way back to wash his hair using the sprayer. Actually if there's room to tilt him the entire shower may be easier on you if he stays tilted. If you are using a face mask or nasal pillows just avoid soaking that area with he sprayer (wash it with a wash cloth). Once my husband was trached we just saved changing the dressing for after his shower. Stepping around the hose takes a bit of practice but once you figure out what arrangement works best for you it will soon become second nature.,True,Nuts,2014-02-23 00:00:00,2576,Lost a loved one,2014-01-01 00:00:00,US,NC,Littleton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/tilting-shower-chair.44770/
44770,2019-07-15 00:00:00,Tilting shower chair,Some people here have used mouthpiece ventilation during showers if the PALS can still initiate a breath that way. That way you don't have the hassle of the mask -- the 15mm mouthpiece plugs into the end of the hose (and note that hoses can be 8 or 10 ft. not just 6).  We rested the machine on the sink and did not lift it during the process.

44770,2019-07-16 00:00:00,Tilting shower chair,Thanks for posting that other thread; helpful to see others have tried what we are planning. At the moment it’s Trilogy as a non-invasive device so we might manage a minute or two without it and then a quick burst using the nasal mask. Our transfers are with a sort of Hoyer lift so the plan is to use that from the bed to the shower wheelchair and then wheel up into the shower in the chair. Our shower space has an overhead shower as usual but a handheld piece is already there as is common in mainland Europe I guess. We haven’t tried mouthpiece ventilation but that could also be an idea.

I absolutely can't imagine how I'd ever be able to go through it again. I know we do because we must but DAMN.  Tillie is spot on. Talk to your mom. She probably has feelings about you having to do this again that outweigh her feelings about being the PALS this time. Seriously. Ask her how her experiences as a caregiver affect her thoughts about dealing with ALS herself. She also needs to talk.  You already know that you will need help. I realize your siblings live in different states but there must be some sort of support from them--even if its frequent visits so you can have a break. Oh and they need to come learn how to give you that break. Or are they in a position to help pay with paid caregivers? Does your mom own her home? Is it adapted? If so you/she may be able to take money out of the house to pay for help. If not then those siblings should be offering to take her in. -- I know your concern is about mom and your loss but these are very valid concerns and issues also.

Since then she’s deteriorated rapidly and today had to be intubated due to oxygen levels crashing following a pneumonia diagnosis. I wasn’t there as I’d gone home after a very long stay but our main caregiver was and described the situation to me in detail. It was only on Monday that the medical staff raised the issue of a trach asking for our views. Even yesterday the consultant neurologist literally said to me the decision wasn’t required in the next day or so but likely by the end of the week. Before all of this my PALS and I had had discussions in which she expressed a preference for a trach though without knowing all of what we learned on Monday. (For example that as a trach doesn’t stop ALS progression and my PALS has already lost all limb function and swallowing they can’t rule out the eyes being impacted.) In addition we live outside our home country and did not know there was no support offered. That gave pause for thought but with only one day between the conversation and now we didn’t re-explore it. Now I’m hoping the intubation is successful and we have a little time. But it’s all brutal and we don’t have firm plans or thoughts.

She teared up I felt next to nothing. It was odd but as I explained to her I need to be like that most of the time. I could’nt function otherwise.  I also said that at some point some time in life you get your thing - that loss that seems insurmountable and is just crazy painful. Most people will have that eventually. This is my turn.

We will probably never know why there was a spike.  When my husband was diagnosed there were 4 PALS in the one small town (not the one in paragraph above). It seemed like a lot! He has been gone 5 years and we have not had more than 1 PALS at any time in that town since.   Suspicion of clusters happens often but isn't always what it appears.   Many of us believe ALS is not a single disease but a group of diseases. Kind of think of it like cancer is not a single disease there are many kinds of cancers. So just maybe something environmental influences some ALS cases but something else influences others. There are many dedicated research teams the world over working really hard to try and solve this. Some of them look at possible clusters and environmental factors. We just don't know so much.   I have no idea how you would approach this as we don't know for sure there are true clusters.   How is your mum doing with coping with the diagnosis and where her progression is at? Do you think she might also benefit by becoming a member here so she can talk to other PALS?,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/both-parents-have-and-have-had-als-i-need-help.44766/
46081,2020-04-06 00:00:00,Thankful,Seems like not too many people are using the caregiver forum so I guess I'll jump in.  As we self- quarantine to avoid COVID-19 I wanted to think about what I am thankful for. I'm thankful that we have a safe place to live and (thus far) plenty of food. I'm thankful that friends have checked in on us to see if we need anything. I'm thankful for Instacart (thanks Laurie). I'm thankful for the forum.  Most of all I'm thankful for my PALS. It's just the two of us. It's hard on both of us he is weaker and struggling I'm emotionally and physically tired. But I'm so fortunate to have him here with me during these times.

43860,2019-03-19 00:00:00,How are you?,"Not a big fan but in the words of Brittany Spears - Oops I did it again. Fell asleep watching a movie with DH last night. Got 5 hours of sleep though so I should be OK.  On another note last night I was thinking about all that we might be doing had DH not gotten this diagnosis. It makes me so sad. We both worked all our lives to provide for our family with the hopes of a pleasant retirement. We were getting oh so close then this. No words. I miss ""us"" the most. This ugly disease has changed us both so much and changed the whole dynamic of our relationship. I sometimes struggle to remember our life before this - just the ""normalness"".  DH is having a really rough time lately. He is despondent over things and I'm getting really worried about it. He did try an anti-depressant when first diagnosed but stopped because he didn't like the side effects. I'm thinking it's time to talk to the Dr about trying again. He struggles trying to fill the hours when he can do so little. I'm wracking my brain trying to come up with something. TV and audible books can only take up so much of the day. He's back in the ""I don't want people to see me like this"" mode so getting him to to agree to go out or even have people over is difficult. Any suggestions? I know he likes to sit out in our backyard but we seem to be back in winter mode again here. I woke up to frost on the ground this morning. He's cold all the time now so bundling him up in a coat and blanket to get him out is not something he'll enjoy. It's supposed to warm up soon. The couple of nice days we had were such a tease. Crossing my fingers that the spring will really get here soon.  So today is another put one foot in front of the other type day.

43860,2019-03-25 00:00:00,How are you?,Last night was awful. Another panic attack. And I am out of his Lorazepam. We have to get our prescriptions mail order per insurance but the refill was just shipped yesterday. Calling his neuro to see if she can send a short term script to the local pharmacy.  I think it's almost a self-fulfilling prophesy thing now. He's worried that he can't sleep which causes the anxiety so he can't sleep. And then he doesn't know what to do. I laid down with him and held his hand but he had me up every 5-10 minutes making another adjustment for him. Covers off head up legs up legs down stretch hands trilogy off trilogy back on stretch feet move hands fan on fan off - and then repeat. Finally around 3 AM I told him he just had to stop. I laid down next to him again and held his hand for a while. He finally did drift off. Of course then I couldn't sleep. I finally got about 3.5 hours.  As I was getting out of the shower he called for me saying he had to go to the bathroom. Pee or sit? He said he thought he had to sit. So I started to get the commode ready. Then he asked if I could do his ROM exercises first. I told him no that after the bathroom I was putting him back in bed. He told me then that he could wait to go to the bathroom. He's now been asleep for another 2 hours.   I hate to be mean but I don't know what to do. He just doesn't know what to do with himself.  On the up-side a friend just texted me she is bringing dinner tonight. I thank God for those kind of friends.

I'm not sure that just  knowing  it wasn't there caused the panic. If I had not told him or slipped a tic-tac in there instead would things have been different? Random thought.   Anyway I did get him to agree to go back to clinic so we could review everything with his neuro and the rest of the team. He has also agreed to at least consider an anti-depressant. The appointment is in 3 weeks so I hope he doesn't change his mind in the mean time.  His aide came today and I decided I needed some ""me time"". I love to drive. It was cold out but sunny so I enjoyed just listening to the radio and having the sun beam down. Drove to the shore and got beach tags for the summer season.

It’s so hard when medical professionals come to the home and are clueless sometimes you feel like what is the point. I’m glad you could get the point across to the chief that dispatches EMS to you home. I cannot believe an ambulance crew would not know simple bagging and that an RT had to “think” about the issue. Just stunning.  Happy to hear you have that go bag too. Always had one for Brian but not for me. Fortunately I was never very far from the hospital and also fortunately my choice hospital was only 5-10 min depending on lights and traffic.  Not sure I even want to have anything to do with ALS again when this is done. If you’ve had time to check my thread you’ll understand why.

40910,2018-06-13 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"Becky I am so glad to hear you are both at home and doing well - GR8! I am glad to hear that it seems that Matt has kicked the persistent infection It's interesting to know that a request for a paramedic could possibly be made; not sure if that is possible in our area or not......? I may have to find out if we need to make sure Dave would only be taken to the medical center which is 6 miles further than our community hospital! At any rate I am sorry to hear of the very stressful situation you both had to endure while traveling via EMS to the hospital; as Sue said - stunning that an ambulance crew did not know how to operate an Ambu bag?!? Thank God for the home health nurse you had with you at the time!  I agree whole-heartedly with you Becky; I don't want Dave to end his days staring at the same spot on the wall for a couple of months. I want him to ""rage against the dying of the light"" as long as that makes sense but I also want to be able to alleviate any horrible situations of distress if I can. In May of 2016 I could have easily lost Dave when he developed ""core pulmonale"" from a very large pulmonary embolism lodged in the area where the right and left pulmonary arteries bifurcate. From what I read most people die from this; Dave's heart was very strong from many years of vigourous hiking etc. We were on the island of Kauai when this happened. The small hospital on island could not deal with Dave's situation (which at the time they thought was an MI but they did not possess the equipment to perform a coranary catheterization). I was given 45 min. to haul A$$ back to the condo throw everything I could imagine into a bag or two and zoom back to the local ER to be ready to fly along with Dave on an inter-island flight back to Oahu. Remarkably I forgot almost nothing for Dave but I did a poor job of packing clothing for me! Great excuse for me to walk to downtown Waikiki for some unplanned shopping after the first tense 1.5 days!  Dave until just very recently has expressed no heroic measures. However I don't want him to suffer with horrible air hunger/anxiety  and  I don't want him to die in a hospital! We have not yet had a true emergency that I couldn't handle (minor things - mostly transfers out of unplanned wheelchair predicaments or minor aspirations) If Dave is in distress and I don't want him to suffer severe air hunger etc. I guess I should call 911 eventhough he has previously said no heroic measures? I guess that is what I would do and go from there ...... This is H*LL - the unknown and planning for when/where/what may hit is never-ending. We don't have hospice on board yet and truthfully the main reason for that is A). Our neuro stated ""you're not ready for that yet"" and B). We still are planning on traveling (which the neuro knows and maybe his reason for #1!?). IDK if we can have hospice on board and then (if Dave is still hanging in there) say ... ""hey we don't need you now 'cause we're going to FL for 2 months ....... call you when we return!"".  Beautiful photo Laurie; thanks. Yes Venice would be an extremely challenging locale because there are many bridges with steps to go over the many canals. Maybe I'll rent some videos on Venice and find some specialty Italian cocktail recipes while we watch some of the video cams you provided links to - good idea! We have watched many nature/science shows for places I would never want to go to personally (Antarctica for example) due to my desire for creature comforts!

40910,2018-06-13 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Buckhorn  There is no reason to believe that Dave would suddenly have air hunger while you lacked a plan and less reason to call 911 if he's a DNR. Like you say you don't want him to die in a hospital.   Air hunger typically doesn't show up out of nowhere from 0 to 60. Whether you have hospice at hand or are on the DIY plan as we were you have morphine (assuming DIYers asked a doc to write it before this day arrives) you can change BiPAP settings you know where the power switch is you can deal.   Note: If someone is gasping for air on an ongoing basis they most often have the wrong BiPAP settings and could be years from death. Sometimes temporary changes are needed too. For example both target volume and backup rates should be turned off during prolonged coughing/choking in favor of static IPAP/EPAP.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/venting-tomorrow-which-will-surely-cause-more-venting.40910/page-8
40910,2018-06-13 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,I would agree that if your PALS wants 'no heroic measures' then calling 911 could put you in a situation. I think this is why it's so important to be clear on what our PALS wants.  There are no rights or wrongs in making that choice. However it comes down to advocating for what our PALS want - if a PALS wants all measures then we have a bag packed and always ready if not then we have things ready at home to cope with looking after them through whatever.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/venting-tomorrow-which-will-surely-cause-more-venting.40910/page-8

We do NOT have any orders for morphine at hand. How do I ask for that!? I thought maybe I had to have hospice involved for morphine orders?  I am totally 100% confindent in my abilities to administer morphine as needed. Many (many) moons ago ...... almost 40 years now I was in a BSN nursing program. I have given my share of IM and sub-Q shots (to people and to our many pets) so I am in my comfort zone there. Yes (until recently) Dave has said no heroic measures. Very recently he admitted that he might want to try IV via tracheostomy to at least give it a try; completely flumocked me and now I am left hanging thinking if I did not at least try that for Dave I would feel forever guilty.

40910,2018-06-14 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,Buckhorn any physician (in our case an internist) can write morphine. Dave does not have to be in hospice. The indication would be that he has experienced air hunger on a temporary basis and you want to be prepared for anything less amenable to mechanical intervention. You might also want to have codeine on hand as it can begin with coughing.  Re the idea of a trach I would take Dave through (not all at once) Diane H's site Becky/Sue's descriptions and some of the others (you can search on vent etc.) And there are YouTube videos.

The experience at this stage is not always a good transition to the tube but it is so variable that it's really day at a time stuff.

Your learnings from Monday are correct so this is where you will really want to understand the care that a trach requires the kind of life that can be expected and document what support you do or do not have from any source.   You do not want to make that decision under duress so I would work on that straightaway. If her pneumonia is severe you may be called upon to make a decision in the moment. You can't rely on the timetable they're guessing at.

45661,2020-01-09 00:00:00,Trach issues,Yes she’s receiving antibiotics and is heavily sedated. They hope to wake her up today and if that’s successful we can hopefully consider our options with her using her eye gaze to communicate. I really didn’t understand all of the limitations of a tracheotomy until the discussion on Monday and I know my PALS didn’t either. Until the morning of intubation they thought it was “only”bronchitis. We thought that was the first good medical news in a year so sat back and relaxed together a little. In any event now it’s all super tricky and I’m quite nervous about the necessity of a decision. For the moment the intubation is in place so I’m hoping we buy a little time. Her parents are (separately) flying over from the US today and Saturday. Thank you both very much for the response. This forum has been such a source of support.,True,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/trach-issues.45661/
45661,2020-01-12 00:00:00,Trach issues,Hi Welts...  As you are already experiencing it is very complicated. You may have already made your decision but I thought I would share a little of our experience. My wife got her trach a little over two years into her diagnosis. That was about three years ago and we've been able to make it work. That being said she was a very healthy woman other than the ALS and relatively young at 52 when trached. She was able to do it electively after two aspiration pneumonia hospital visits in two weeks. It was still a pretty tough go for a while after the operation.   She was almost entirely incapacitated at the time of the operation and has been relatively stable since. She has been able to enjoy a fulfilling life of sorts (does still get outdoors for outings of some sort most days) although dramatically different from when she was well and very active. Her eyes still work quite fine and she communicates nicely with her Tobii Eye Gaze. She can't do that for too long each days as her eyes get tired. Both of us are glad she went with the trach but we are at a point where she could well live several more years and I am feeling pretty burnt out...so something has to give at some point.  I can't begin to understand your situation there in Brussels...how you will afford it how accessible your home is what kind of help you will have. I wouldn't advise someone one here in the states to do it or not to do it. It is an extremely personal decision. Please understand that since your PALS has lost all limb function and swallowing like my PALS has she will may well need near constant care and attention. You'd be super human to do it all yourself.  I'm sorry you both are in this situation and I hope you are able to gather some good information of how it can work there in Belgium so you can make as educated a decision as possible and have some peace about it. Hope this note helps a little.  All the best!,True,jonico,2017-02-21 00:00:00,157,Lost a loved one,2014-12-01 00:00:00,US,NY,Central,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/trach-issues.45661/

45661,2020-02-02 00:00:00,Trach issues,An update to say intubation continues but not for much longer so a trach decision is imminent. My PALS is tending towards favouring a tracheotomy though with some wishful thinking (or is it faith?) about quality of life thereafter. I don’t want to break her spirit and entice or induce a lack of action but I remain concerned that the implications are perhaps not yet fully understood. Before this intubation my PALS had no leg or arm movement no head movement and had just lost swallowing and talking a few days before hospitalisation. She has had a PEG since being in hospital. I can’t envisage a calm future against this backdrop even with a tracheotomy. Am I too negative? Rightly cautious? I’ve read older posts on this forum about tracheotomy issues but I can’t tell whether PALS have generally lost as much as mine has pre-trach.,True,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/trach-issues.45661/
45661,2020-02-02 00:00:00,Trach issues,I would presume that your PALS is about the same as Jonico's wife in terms of motor function that basically only the eyes work in terms of voluntary movement for communication. That means to communicate she would likely need an eye gaze setup. Has she tried one? That would be pretty critical to her quality of life I would think.,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/trach-issues.45661/
45661,2020-02-02 00:00:00,Trach issues,I am so sorry for what you are going through. My stepdaughter 52 was diagnosed in Nov 2018 and declined rapidly. She was trached in July. She could still write at the time but lost that by early October. She is completely paralyzed other then very minor head control. She uses eye gaze. She has QoL by her standards spending time with her 15 y/o boys everyday. She doesn't get out much as it's so much effort. We have 24/7 care that we her parents pay for and I'm a constant care manager. This is an extremely difficult decision to have to make in the moment and personally nothing prepares you for the reality. The trach was stabilizing in that the fast downhill slide of lost motor function and breathing came to a halt. Not much left to lose. So as long as she stays healthy otherwise my PALS could live for a number of years. Caregiver burn out is very real. I hope you and your PALS have an opportunity to talk about all of it.

45661,2020-02-02 00:00:00,Trach issues,"Weltschmerz (excellent screen name)  I wish I had uplifting words or some factual data that would brighten your day but all I can do is relate my own limited experience.  I have had email correspondence with PALS who were able to use an Eye Gaze apparatus to surf the web. One PALS told me she consider her quality of life to be good all things considered. But when the PALS can no longer communicate of course no one knows what their life is like.  My wife tried eye gaze but it was difficult to use. You must play with it for quite a bit to get the hang of it. And the sensors must be placed exactly perfectly each time it is used.   My wife's ALS moved faster than yours. Nine months from first symptom to passing. As long as she had the ability to blink she did not complain. She had several emergencies with breathing that we quickly fixed for her.   She refused all tubes. No PEG no trach no IV. She also told us in advance in writing that she wanted no life saving measures. If she went into ""air hunger"" we were to give her morphine not oxygen. This we did a couple of times.  She asked for a catheter because I kept spilling the urinal.  One morning her eyes could no longer blink. There was no way to tell if she was in pain. She could not respond to the letter board or even tell me ""yes"" or ""no."" I spent that day putting eye drops into her eyes to prevent them from drying out which would be painful.  She passed that evening.   If she had a trach and a PEG...I can't imagine what our remaining lives would have been like. How long could she live? If she decided to end it all how would we know?  My only two words of advice are these and they are only my opinion which you may certainly reject if you wish: 1) I believe the PALS should get whatever they decide and be supported without question even if we think they are not deciding the right thing.  2) The CALS must consider quality of life not only for the PALS but also for the surviving family. After she's gone you all still have to get back into regular life. Any decisions you make should also consider the sacrifices of the rest of the family including yourself. ALS is certainly going to destroy one life--don't let it destroy yours too.  Good luck Weltschmerz.

41449,2018-06-16 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,Hi Lenore  I don’t say much on here but I have been following your thread for a while. So much of your last post here really resonated with me today. I have to say thank you for some of the very open discussions in the last couple of weeks. My PALS has made some similar decisions to yours wrt intervention I think and some of your questions and comments and the resulting discussions have been very helpful to me.  I’m glad you enjoyed the drive thorough the parkway and the view from the office. When my PALS got to the point where he became very dependent on me for well everything a friend asked me how I managed to get through my days and not crumble in a heap. I told her I tried to appreciate and be grateful for the little things. Even as it came out of my mouth I felt like it sounded so cliche. True though. It’s not always easy but it’s just so important and makes such a difference.   I find myself sometimes having to explain things about my PALS to people and I marvel at how matter of fact and detached I can sound about the whole situation. I often wonder if I come across as uncaring. I still curl up in bed with my dogs and just cry sometimes after I put him to bed but I just wouldn’t be able to get through every insanely busy day if I were weeping all the time.   Well done on getting to the attorney and getting things sorted. You are gong to be okay. Its nice to actually feel that way every once in a while.   I’m know what you mean about the house. I look around ours and see the padded grips I put on the bannister when Neil was still negotiating the stairs all the scuff marks on the walls and doors from the walkers and then the wheelchairs all the bars and rails and little fixes I put up at various stages to temporarily solve various problems for him and I wonder if I will ever fix them or even if I do if I will ever be able to really see those parts of the house without all the adaptations equipment and scars.

I’m glad you got to lay it all out for a friend. And you are not along in talking about it like you did. I do the same and maybe that keeps others from seeing the help required to get through this. However I do believe like you that if we don’t box it up so we can deal we won’t deal at all.  Add on top issues with parents it just really is too much but we press on.  And I totally get the house thing. I have stated several times I don’t think I can stay here after. There is part truth to it being too big but the other side of it and probably bigger is just it has too many bad memories. And even worse is it has an awesome floor plan I love this one better than our other two homes. But I don’t think I can stay here. With all of Brian’s stuff having been in the Master I don’t think I could sleep there. So I completely understand.  It’s true as well about everyone having their own “thing”.

Today I sat and calculated how long it will take me to get xactly where I want to be to buy on my own and I think it’s about 24 months to get to that perfect down payment and credit score. It goes without saying that in all reasonable likelihood Brian will be gone by then and that too will happen in this house. My mind has turned to practical things in a cool way. Maybe because we are ever closer.  I was single so long. The life of being a wife is so different from being single in some ways restricting yes but in many other ways easier. My husband for example did that perfect combination of things to have a crazy high credit score. Mine was alright his was/is close to 900. Basically any item you ever want to finance be it a home or car or whatever is interest free or very near it at that level. So losing that advantage. It’ll be okay and I can more than manage on my own I do have a good job. Just makes you think.  He could also do any and everything at home we never called for help. He took delivery of our water heater to the curb put it on a dolly and installed it himself in the basement. Now I need help and have to do things myself. I generally do not waste time complaining on these things you just get it done. Yet now with attorneys and having to sell his truck so I don’t have to mess with getting the title in my name to sell it later open a third bank account finish the advance care directive it all comes home and is real.  It’s okay just gotta get through this. Well it will never be okay it just is. I tear up randomly too. Did it this morning making breakfast. I like hiding in the kitchen it’s a place to feel a bit without showing it. Brian does not need my tears. A friend said she and her PALS use to cry together.

Sorry I have not kept up with your threads; I was once subscribed to one of your threads (""A place to speak my truths"") but that one obviously ended. I don't have too much time to scroll thru everytihng...... At any rate I hope to be here for you now and then and comment when I think I have something helpful to say.  Regarding ALS as commonly known as ""Lou Gehrig's Disease"" in the U.S. yeah - it kinda bugs me a bit too. I think it just stuck ...... and sometimes labels/monikers are hard to get rid of. I think at the time (&amp; for many years thereafter) it was a good thing considering it helped to raise public awareness of the disease. Lou was nicknamed the ""Ironhorse"" ......... set the record for many/many years of never missing a game. So hence ...... if   HE   could get this terrible disease - considering what a super-human athelete he was...... you get the picture. The label stuck I guess but IMO it is less commonly thought of as Lou Gherig's disease today. Just my opinion.   A side note to this is that I read that Lou Gherig's Summer house was in .........  TaDa!!!  - Lyme's Connecticut. Call me a conspiracy therorist but why is an increase in ALS associated only with outdoor sports (soccer football etc.  but never with basketball swimming gymnastics ........ So an increased prevalence of ALS is not associated purely with athletes/hyper-conditioning but with exposure to turf!? In our experience we live  IN  the woods in Central PA which now leads the nation in tick-borne diseases. I was treated last year to a classic Lyme's infected tick-bite (which does NOT mean I had ""Lyme's Disease""; I was lucky - I developed a rash and was treated promply and for 30 days). I've picked 3 of the little septic-pool suckers off myself in the past month. It makes me wonder how many I've had that I never noticed. My husband had several tick exposure's/bites/removals over many years. Approx. 6 months after being bitten by a tick having a Lyme's rash and a very high fever of 104F!! and having treatment for Lyme's Disease he developed ALS. My neighbor (who lives 150 yards away) was diagnosed and treated for Babiosa (a severe tick-borne illness) also after having a severely high fever and joint pain. Our 6 y.o. otherwise healthy Sheltie died of Lyme's nephritis (destroyed his kidneys). So am I suggesting Lyme's/tick bites are a causative factor in ALS ......? Who knows. It's just one of the many inigmas of this BEASTLY disease of ALS ........ I think a genetic predisposition/weakness for it in combination to unknown triggers may set it off.  So sorry - I digress - but any suggestion in the Lyme's forum on this forum will be soundly smacked down! Let's see if the forum monitors clip this comment...... At any rate Lenore I will try to follow your current thread more closely and I am sending you thoughts of strength comfort and love.",True,Buckhorn,2016-01-03 00:00:00,725,Lost a loved one,2015-12-01 00:00:00,US,PA,Small town,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/hold-on-tight.41449/page-7

I wonder about morphine too. Our wonderful family doctor (also very palliative knowledgable) prescribed Ativan (as needed) against panic and morphine drops (via the tube) against beginning air hunger. She wanted him to take a baby dose (as she put it) of four-times a day 2 drops adding up to only 10 mg a day. After the first three doses he had an late evening episode of air hunger (without the mask) heightend pulse (110) dizzyness and hot/cold feeling. Put him under the mask and talked to him he didn't want the Ativan yet it got better after maybe 15 min. Same repeated the next night. I'm guessing side effects and we stopped the morphine for now and will talk to our doctor this afternoon.  Our nurse suggested very modestly that it's maybe too early for morphine and that the side effects will diminish automatically once the drug is ""needed"". Like it's running amok now because there is no persistent symptom it can tackle. (She told me from her experience that pain patients don't get addicted to morphine prabably because the drug pushes them up to a normal level whereas it would push a healthy person without pain over the normal level to a heightend state.) She also said that the Ativan will probably be sufficient for small attacks of air hunger he had so far.  Two days ago we did shower with the mask for the first time and he took his first half Ativan to prepare for it. He didn't notice any serious effects and it worked pretty well. I'm confident now that a whole one won't mush him in a crisis.  Oh I digressed! What I wanted to know is: If I give him some morphine drops in a crisis will they act faster when given sublingual (swallowing is not his favourite pastime) than via tube? Or would that be different drops altogether? Our doctor also mentioned morphine as a s.c. shot or skin-pop (as Keith Richards would prefer it). That would attack much quicker than orally/tube especially if digestion is slow but it's something for later on.      Buckhorn said:    ... and someday soon I hope to start my own thread.

Morphine causes the symptoms you described as well as possibly constipation confusion etc.   Some people say ""Start it early and s/he will need less later."" One we don't have any evidence that's true in this population generally given ALS is in part a disease of metabolism. And if the argument is that air hunger begins early and we are warding it off skip to point 4.   Two if air hunger is breaking through any level of morphine the level of sedation relative to higher dosing is very individual but the point will be enough morphine to be comfortable not a pre-established dose. Three no one gets extra credit for dying while getting lower morphine doses. Four air hunger is a sign until the very end of life that BiPAP settings should be at least re-examined and improved titration attempted. Why would we want to mask that information?

45661,2020-02-03 00:00:00,Trach issues,Thanks to you all for these comments. Yes it’s only eye function that works now. Fortunately my PALS has had a Tobii eye gaze for a few months now since her arms stopped working. She used the tablet/Tobii to keep working until just before going into hospital. She enjoys using the “regular” internet sending WhatsApp messages and watching YouTube videos and series on Netflix. When I’m not in hospital with her we message and I can’t quite get over how ordinary a message appears on WhatsApp now I know the effort involved to produce it. So communication is pretty clear and her mental state is lucid and fairly ordinary. All of this of course relies on being able to blink and use her eye muscles to reach each part of the screen. Any notion of losing that terrifies me as the CALS even if she is able to park that thought to keep going.   Just for additional background my PALS has been dependent on the Trilogy machine 24/7 since June and we are now at 13 months since diagnosis. By and large she derives a decent QoL (in her own view) based almost exclusively on having the Tobii eye gaze and computer that opens up a world of internet options. However for me it’s hard to watch the suffering that goes around that QoL and if I’m honest also hard to consider the detrimental impact on my own QoL this past year and to come.,True,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/trach-issues.45661/
45661,2020-02-03 00:00:00,Trach issues,"There is her view on her QoL and there is yours on yours. It is very difficult for a PALS and CALS to align on the other's quality of life. One is immobile the other is not.  You owe it to both of you to talk frankly about what your lives will be like if her life is extended indefinitely and as we discussed before how much outside support if any you will have. As others have said without outside support it is a very hard road. That does not mean you should not take it but it should be a very conscious and informed decision made in partnership.  For some here infections and other complications have kept that particular journey from lasting a long time.  For others the journey has outlasted their ability to deal with some taking steps to end it and others simply awaiting death.  For others such as Jonico's wife and Naturelover's stepdaughter the trach seems worthwhile although as you have read the CALS will always have a different perspective.   Diane Huberty  is a nurse with ALS who has had a trach for a long time but she still has some movement so it's different for her. In the page I hyperlinked she points out that before undertaking a trach a legal framework for what happens if the PALS becomes unable to communicate should be in place [as it should be for all PALS].  As you say a PALS' ability to use eye gaze may end at any time. The technology beyond that like ""thinking"" actions via computer interfaces using attached or implanted devices is  promising  but not as yet available at scale.",True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/trach-issues.45661/
45661,2020-02-03 00:00:00,Trach issues,"Naturelover nailed it and lgelb offered great insight to consider (check out Braingate. I believe eyegaze technology will be a thing of the past in the not too distant future). It seems your wife is younger than both mine and Naturelover's stepdaughter. It is very possible your wife could live reasonably comfortably for quite some time.  A couple things to consider...   My wife wanted the trach and there was no way I could say ""no it's going to be too hard for me"" (In actuality I was somewhere between fully supportive and scared to death of the prospect). I knew I couldn't live with having essentially unilaterally made that decision. That was my personal experience with the decision part of it for what it is worth. That left the only question being how are we going to do this? That was pretty daunting but has been doable.  Also regarding communicating with the eyes I can't imagine her eyes would go so quickly that she couldn't communicate wishes to bring hospice in if communicating with them becomes untenable. My wife's eyes are very gradually weakening. We also don't use an eye blink method for communicating when the Tobii isn't in front of her. She looks toward us for yes and to one side or the other for no. We find it much easier for everyone to understand than eye blinks and we are sure it is less tiring for her as well. She can also tell us a lot by looking in various directions for various needs and uses a basic alphabet sheet - looking at or away from us for selecting letters. The other side of the letter sheet has boxes of common requests in rows.

Please note I am not and have never been a medical professional so this information is just from our experience. When my pals was first exhibiting symptoms I noticed that he was slurring his words. Now in hindsight this was unusual as he has limb onset. A year after he had been diagnosed I contacted his neurologist after reading about the possibility of Neudezta slowing bulbar symptoms. My husband also was having some unusual mood changes. The neurologist then prescribed Neudexta. it definitely helped my pals and he is still eating by mouth 5 years later no feeding tube. It also improved his ability to speak clearly and he only recently lost that ability although still tries and I can usually understand him. I am not sure it will help everyone as this illness varies among pals but want to encourage you to follow up with neurologists with any questions you may have about treatment. The Neudexta information was new when we were diagnosed and perhaps there will be other new treatments for those recently diagnosed as well. We certainly didn't think when we were first diagnosed that we would beat the odds.

Honestly if these supplements were working to keep him healthy he would not have developed ALS. We've tried various vitamins (all sold by his multi-level marketing ""friends"") daily juicing keto diet gluten free protein shakes etc. Lately he is glued to YouTube watching Mark Manchester. I understand Manchester claims to have reversed his ALS through a combination of supplements detoxing gluten free diet and aromatherapy. My PALS just spent several hundred dollars on the supplements he recommended. He also has a couple of friends who feed this by telling him to continue to ""think positively"" and telling him he can ""beat this.""   It probably a weakness of mine but I become frustrated at what I view as his continued denial of the situation at times. He says I am being negative if I don't believe that he will get well and asked me if I just want him to give up. I feel that he has put off doing an advanced directive and thinking about any of the future problems and developments I will face. I wish I thought he could get well and didn't feel pressured by this. I wish we could try harder to live in the moment and enjoy what we can now. He seems to want to wait until he ""gets well"" to do anything.   I don't know if any other CALS have experienced this and whether you have any advice. He won't consider support groups or counseling (not that those things are happening now anyway).   OK done venting. No one else seems to be posting on the CALS forum these days...

46146,2020-04-19 00:00:00,Thinking of You All,My husband Brian passed from ALS on 3/13/19. On the very day I’d taken off last month to set aside some time to remember him and us it seemed liked Covid exploded in the news. That weekend I went to get my car worked on and it hit me that everyone was in gloves and the usual donuts at the shop were gone. Let’s not even rehash the whole supermarket experience.  i cannot even fathom how much harder being a CALS would be with the Pandemic in force. If we’d been locked down with little help available if any things would have been so much more difficult.  As I was just noting in another thread though it seems to me now that CALS and PALS have a special strength and tenacity. the situations ALS creates leaves us with little choice but to cope and so we do. In the cities anyway the ALSA is a great resource for equipment and helping to resolve issues. Then of course there are the often unexpected friends and family who turn out to be the most helpful. In Covid of course that part gets more difficult.  Stay safe and as sane as you can. Know that as a CALS or PALS you are never truly alone.

46246,2020-05-09 00:00:00,Tracheotomy - again,Well after 4 months in hospital 2 of which are post-trach we are now looking into options for moving on. Unfortunately any international travel (eg to return home to the UK) has been paused due to corona. Here in Belgium it’s either a nursing home or returning home. Only the latter is what my PALS wants though very tricky while we are both abroad without many friends and family. It is even trickier because the system here is not remotely set up to accommodate home care like this. Caregivers need to be found by “the family” (ie me) and then sent to the hospital for training. All of this looks and sounds very difficult. My question here is more about the prospects/prognostic element of a trach. I haven’t had a clear steer from any medical professionals and much of the guidance presupposes a PALS does not get to this stage; but I just don’t have a sense of the risk element of a trach. Are things likely to be stable (all relative) or are we looking at lots of potential infection difficulty etc? So far there seems to be Robinul every 4 hours plus aspiration/suction as required with cough assist a couple of times per day. Together with basic hygiene etc the other bit is PEG feeding and water. Lots of possible problems I imagine - or do people with experience of caring for someone with a trach have other suggestions for things to consider? The only muscles that work well for my PALS are the eyes. Recently an ophthalmologist said even the facial muscles around the mouth and cheeks aren’t working normally. My PALS can’t part her own lips or keep her mouth open properly so I am quite worried about progression to the eyes. Diagnosis January 2019 with very few issues before then; and intubation January 2020 so this has been a terribly rapid descent.,False,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/tracheotomy-again.46246/

That aside there are many good people here who are also walking/running along the same ALS path as you.  You are not alone.  If you will look in the Caregivers section of the forums you'll find ""stickies"" that will answer a lot of your initial questions. Please feel comfortable asking any specific questions you may have. You will get answers and differing perspectives that will help you with choices and decisions that you might find before you.  My PALS was showed first ""what the heck is this"" symptoms in November of 2012. Our two children were then in their 20s. Both are now in their 30s. They have adjusted well to their Mom's ALS situation... as I suspect your children will too. Our approach was to be transparent open and honest with them along this entire path. My son was with us at a clinic visit when Darcey's neurologist told her frankly that she was in her last 6 months of life... so she should plan accordingly. Darcey smiled at her doctor and said something to the effect of ""Thank you... but I've still a lot to do and accomplish before I'm ready to give it up."" That was in March of 2016.  For me personally I had to find a way to visualize what was going on. I talked about this with Darcey and came up with an analogy. We imagined that we were on a train. We didn't ask to be on this train but we were on this train nonetheless. We knew where it was going but we didn't know how long it would take us to get there. And it seemed that we couldn't get off until we reached that end destination. Fortunately we could see options. We could try to make the best of each day that we had on this crazy ride or we could perpetually bemoan the fact that we were here. We took the first choice and have done most everything we could to make these the best days that we could. I hope that once the shock of all of this lessens that you're able to still grasp and hold onto all the many good things that will still come your way.

Since his progression sounds fast starting the process for a power wheelchair for which there are pandemic provisions to do as much as possible via telemedicine is probably advisable.   Just wondering did you look at Rutgers/RWJ as a possible clinic rather than having to go into the city? Did he get a second opinion on the diagnosis?

46238,2020-05-07 00:00:00,Brand new to this,Columbia is the place in your region for ALS genetics. Matt Harms MD does a lot of work in ALs genetics. Assuming the diagnosis is confirmed you might ask about their research study in family ALS. Pretty sure it is on hold due to the coronavirus but if they accept people without an identified family mutation your children might be interested. If there is an unidentified mutation ( as opposed to bad luck) getting your dna into research studies is a good idea So your husband should accept if he is asked to give a sample too. gradually they have chipped away at unidentified FALS.,True,Nikki J,2012-03-22 00:00:00,11246,PALS,2014-04-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Boston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/brand-new-to-this.46238/

46226,2020-05-04 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,Hi V  I can empathize. This is definitely another frustrating aspect of this disease it seems to affect people differently and progression rates definitely vary.   We also have had well meaning folks suggest expensive treatment equipment light therapy multi level marketing supplements etc. but chose to pass on those. We implemented common sense methods like a healthy diet prescribed meds doctor recommended supplements and avoiding falls.   The ‘think positive -you can beat this’ is especially annoying to me as I believe it puts the blame on the patient for the illness’s progression and makes them think that there is something they can do to cure themselves. Having the illness is bad enough without a guilt trip. The message should be ‘ Focus on your quality of life today and have a plan in place for down the road’  Fortunately we both have advance directives as part of putting together our wills/etc. a few years ago. It is a good thing to have in place ALS or no ALS. Perhaps you can frame it that way.  I don’t have a lot of advice I am afraid. Its unnerving to see his progression and think about what’s coming and how we are going to handle it and for the most part the planning has fallen to me. It means I have to be a realist. I don’t think you are being negative I think everyone’s situation is unique and you are doing the best you can with yours.

46226,2020-05-04 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,You are definitely not being 'negative' and I really agree with ARCG that the huge issue with the 'think positive' fallacy is that it invites blame. If only he had tried harder or if only she had supported him better or whatever. It is a load of bunkum and it makes other people feel better but doesn't change our situation one jot.   Sure having a positive attitude might make a difference but not a cure. A positive attitude like this one finding a cure could make things worse as our strategies for living well to manage symptoms may be ignored.  However you know your own heart and you know you don't want him to just give up. My Chris would tell me that I just wanted to put him in a corner to rot. Very hard stuff especially if the PALS is slow progressing. That probably makes it easier for people to keep suggesting he can find a way to beat it.  I wish I had true suggestions I don't know the answers as he won't want to let go of these beliefs.

I want to say thank you God knows we couldn't maintain any sense of normalcy without you. I understand your concern about false hope gimmicky products snake oil salesmen and soothsayers. Only you know the person you're caring for. If you are a relative this must be devastating to watch. I couldn't imagine any of my family going through this. If it had to be I would gladly take this  over someone I cherish.  I can't speak for anyone else. I know ALS is non-treatable and incurable. I don't have the financial ability to try this or that. I eat whatever I want my doctor cautioned against loosing weight. I take my riulzole and continue with the radacava infusions. The only extra is I inhale thc products to ease the faciculations and one a day vitamin. We all deal with our own mortality differently. I wouldn't try to speculate how another person copes.  Unfortunately I think you don't get to decide how why or what they feel think or behave like. I had this idea of how my ALS journey was going to go. It was me with my sons daughters in law and grandchildren looking through photos talking about memories laughing sometimes crying. Reality they all have lives. We know what we mean to each other. I talk to my oldest every day and grandchildren at least once a week. They drop in 23 times a week for a while. My middle every Thursday 8:30 he lives 1500 miles away. The baby nailing him down for a minute is like nailing air. I FaceTime with him when he takes a minute to call. Lol. It is like you ok mom? Yes you? Yes ok gotta go. Cracks me up. I have raised 3 successful men that was my job. Continue to support your ALS stricken loved ones in their choices even if it doesn't make sense to you. My husband died 20 years ago our sons were 814and 18 they are now 2834and 38. I will miss them terribly when I die but I have to meet them where they are not where I want them to be. When my husband died we had all of our arrangements made so I was able to grieve with my boys without having to tend to the business behind the ritual.

At the moment my PALS is still in hospital and the last few months since the trach have been some of our best times.

46246,2020-05-18 00:00:00,Tracheotomy - again,My daughter has been on a trach since July 2019. She has a little head control not much and uses eye gaze technology to speak. Unfortunately her blinking is weaker so we are also worried about her losing the ability to communicate at all. Care for someone in her position is extremely time consuming and a bit daunting. I cannot imagine doing it myself without help. I am in the US and we also have to find our own caregivers for home care. Once she left the hospital the training has been on us too. She has been stable ie: no other major illnesses or infections since about 3 months post trach and I realize everyone has their own journey. You have this added challenge of being in a different country than your own. Until you can get your wife home you may need to rely on a care home in order to keep your wife cared for safely. I am so sorry for your very difficult situation!!,True,Naturelover,2020-01-07 00:00:00,4,CALS,2018-11-01 00:00:00,US,WA,Bellevue,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/tracheotomy-again.46246/
46246,2020-05-24 00:00:00,Tracheotomy - again,Hi W Nice hearing from you even though you are facing some substantial challenges. I can't speak to the whole home vs. nursing home thing in Belgium. Can't imagine being far from home in the UK during Covid times and going through this!   Regarding the trach I can only recommend you not worry too much about it and take it one day at a time. I can only speak from our experience at about 5 1/2 years post diagnosis and almost 3 1/2 years post trach and and a little longer with feeding tube. We have had almost no problems with either of them. No problems with the trach area at all and only a few times where the g-tube area has gotten a little tender and swollen and a dose of antibiotics has quickly solved the problem.   Personally I wouldn't read too much into the ophthalmologist's assessment of the mouth and cheek area. For as long as I can remember with this damn thing my wife hasn't been able to open her mouth enough to get a tooth brush in (we use a swab and do our best). Until recently she was gnawing on her tongue on the left side (she finally thought of us putting a rolled drain sponge between her front teeth which has helped tremendously). Still the clenched teeth problem is unsolvable.... but she still smiles beautifully...with her mouth area and  especially with her eyes . We worry about the eyes failing at some point but she is hanging in there so far.  Regarding the other concerns you have we cough assist and suction her far more often than you are referencing for your wife (more often than once per hour on average) but it always does the trick. It's not a big deal. My wife's progression was pretty quick pre-trach although not as quick as your's. That being said it was still pretty quick progression pre-trach and then much slower decline subsequently (essentially a stabilization). I don't mean to be cavalier but I strongly suggest continually focusing on one day at a time my friend and do your best to enjoy every minute you have with your wonderful wife while it lasts. the trach has given you more of that time.,True,jonico,2017-02-21 00:00:00,157,Lost a loved one,2014-12-01 00:00:00,US,NY,Central,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/tracheotomy-again.46246/

She has been communicating with a tobii device using eye gaze since October when she could no longer write. Medicare pays for this. It takes patience on the CALS part to make sure you give her the time to say what she wants to say to not look over her shoulder or finish her sentences for her. We also use eye blink for lots of yes/no questions.

46264,2020-05-18 00:00:00,comforting a loved one with bulbar,Hi I am a PALS with Bulbar symptoms. My son downloaded “Text to Speech” to my iPad; it is quite effective. He also bought me a Blue Tooth connected iPad keyboard; I keep them together in the nice carrying case.  Text to Speech is a free program but I paid the $4.99 to remove the annoying pop up adds. If your family member still has good hand control they can type in what they want to say then press the arrow to make is speak. I am surprised at how good the program is... I also have a communication board from the VA to speak for me but this is so much easier to take with me.  You can choose a ”voice” that sounds the most like you (there are a variety of male and female voices) and you can also adjust how fast it speaks for you. Any computer savvy family member can show you how to set it up and use it. I use it a lot as talking is very difficult most people can’t understand me anyway and my husband is hard of hearing so communication is challenging. It even works well when I am on the phone. You can save commonly used phrases too so you do not have to type them in each time you want to speak. I saved a comment to the effect of “I use a computer voice to speak for me. Please give me time to answer you...”  Hope this helps Vera,True,PrimaVera,2020-04-23 00:00:00,9,PALS,2020-03-01 00:00:00,US,CT,Shelton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/comforting-a-loved-one-with-bulbar.46264/
46226,2020-05-05 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,"Thanks all for your input and insights. I guess I feel like he has been missing out on things he could be enjoying because he is so focused on ""getting well"". I told him I am willing to try whatever he wants to try. Jrzygrl we had ""friends"" who tried to sell us the Bemer too. I had to end the friendship after multiple attempts to pressure us into buying it.   I thought perhaps if I put together my advanced directive he might agree to put one together as well. No such luck. At least I have mine in place.   It is hard for me to manage everything...not just his illness and caregiving but his business and his rentals his finances and bills and my business and our household and the broken sprinkler in the back and the washing machine that I had to fix myself because the repairman won't come. (I was actually quite proud of myself to have fixed the washer successfully). And the bathroom modifications and construction of the elevator.  We don't have kids so I don't have anyone to not come over. Not that we have visitors now. In a way the quarantining isn't so different for us and in a way it is. We had just finished the elevator and bought the van so we could have some things to do and then the world shut down. Yesterday for the first time I did get him over to the park which was open for the first time in over a month. Not for picnics and parties but just for exercise. It is better for both of us if we can get out and have some sunshine.  This morning our caregiver who has been with us for a little more than a year told me she is going to be leaving us. She is pregnant with twins. I saw her struggling yesterday when we took my PALS outside so I think it's best for all of us. She has a proposed replacement who is coming tomorrow to meet us. I'm thankful for the time she has spent with us and wish her all the best.

46226,2020-05-05 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,You are both missing out on things you could be enjoying together and that truly sucks.  My Chris was very different and put all his energy into insisting on things like walking to the toilet and back (would take 15 minutes inside a small house) but then had no energy to come for a walk or even a wheelchair walk outside with me for some enjoyment.  So I felt like we couldn't live in the now enjoy what we did have on any particular day and was just racing around managing everything.  Again different situation for me but I can resonate with so many of the feelings.  That is so awesome that you fixed the washer I wouldn't have even known where to start - did youtube help you out? I have been stunned at some of the things I've managed to do with the help of youtube since Chris died.   It's really good for you to say all these things here because it can really help just get it out take a breath and go back into the situation a little lighter for doing so.

46226,2020-05-11 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,I've only just read this post and it's ironic that I'm also a cALS in San Diego! I'm 39 he's 41 and we have a 7 year old daughter.  I could have literally written your post about your pALS thinking he's going to get better and missing out on life. My husband is slow progressing dx Aug 2018. We live in a 3 story home (the garage is the first level) and I had insomnia for the first year because I was so stressed about how we would handle later stages of the disease without being able to easily get him in/out of the house (there is a staircase to the front door of the house). He had always been the person in the relationship to make our financial decisions and plan for the future. But he continues to believe to this day that he will get Nurown any day now and then he will go back to normal and be able to walk up/down stairs etc. I have boxes and boxes full of supplements that he's ordered since Aug 2018 taken a few pills of decided it doesn't work and stopped taking. He has never wanted to talk about or figure out how to handle anything with me not the financial not the physical aspects not a single shred of medical directives (does he want a feeding tube or vent?) or future planning for me and our daughter. He's just stuck on the idea that his life is only ON HOLD and once he gets Nurown everything will go back to how it was before.   I feel abandoned by my pALS who has left me to try to figure everything out by myself. He doesn't do anything to try to adapt to his changing physical circumstances and it's all entirely on me to figure out what to do. This forum has been such a huge help for me in figuring out the equipment to use when he needed a raised toilet seat getting him a rollator to walk from the bedroom to the bathroom and his office (he still works from home). I just feel stuck all the time not knowing if he wants a feeding tube or a vent. He says he doesn't know if he wants it either. I told him it's not fair for him to not make a decision on it because it's forcing me to make the decision at the last minute when it's needed and I know whatever I decide will probably be the wrong thing and he won't end up wanting whatever I choose. He just doesn't reply.   He stopped being able to get up and down the front steps around in October 2019. We had a pulmonologist visit on March 12 and that was the last time my pALS went downstairs or left the house. He finally came around to the idea that we have to move (although by this point I was facing all the packing and moving of all items by myself!) and we had signed a listing agreement to sell our house in mid-March. Me and our 7 year old daughter had gone to view a potential property (single story) for purchase and then the whole shut-down thing happened. Technically we could still list/sell our home and try to buy a new property. Honestly I've been so stressed about the new virus normal working full time from home (although it's been a blessing to be home with my pALS because he had been home by himself and we don't have any caregiver or assistance at all) teaching our daughter at home the thought of packing up a 2100 square foot home by myself has overwhelmed me beyond the point of being able to take any further action. Not to mention the risk of having strangers come into the house to view it exposing my pALS to the virus risk.   So we are still living in this 3 story house and I feel like I've given up on the idea of moving us out of the house. My pALS doesn't want to move because we bought this house with the intention of staying here until we grew old and died. I don't want to move because I thought the same thing. I feel guilty though. I see other pALS on social media and they are in the living room watching TV and generally being close to the rest of the family. My pALS is only in the computer room our bedroom and the bathroom. Our daughter usually stays downstairs during the day she has her laptop for school set up in the living room and my work laptop is set up downstairs in the dining room. The easiest thing for me to do is just let us stay living here because I don't have to pack clean choose a new house do all the documents etc. But I'm constantly wracked with guilt whether it's the best thing for him or not. And it still doesn't solve the problem if he has to leave the house and I'm specifically thinking about wildfire season and potential evacuations because we live in a high wildfire risk zone.   Wow I feel like I went way off tangent on this post. I've only been lurking around here without posting because my pALS is on this forum too and I've been concerned about him reading any kind of ranting/venting post about him. Although I've already said all these things to him and we communicate (or at least I try to communicate with him) about it regularly. I just don't get any communication or input back from him.,True,Cristin P,2018-08-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2018-08-01 00:00:00,US,CA,San Diego,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-pals-and-denial.46226/
46226,2020-05-11 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,Cristin and V both of your posts really hit home with me. I faced the same situation with my husband. He was mostly in denial until probably the last week of his life when I could see that he was actively dying. He had slow progression with weakness limited to one wrist for about 4 years (2007) before he even went to his doctor to have it checked out. The diagnosis process took almost 3 years after that since he saw 3 neurologists and got opinions ranging from possible ALS to definitely not ALS to finally definitely ALS. My husband was always the optimist in our family and he truly believed that he was going to outlive Stephen Hawking and be around when a cure was discovered. I have always been more of a pessimist-- or possibly a realist.  I think he needed his denial and optimism to get him through this shattering diagnosis and illness of perpetual loss although it was very hard on me. Luckily we had our wills and medical directives completed before the ALS diagnosis or I do not think he would have done that after diagnosis.  I had to handle everything by myself-- applying for disability medicare  supplemental insurance ordering supplies  medical equipment and meds even though he was initially still physically able to do these things by himself if he wanted to. He just wanted no part of doing it or even thinking about it and would try to go to the gym every day thinking that exercise and supplements were the answer to prolonging his life.  His denial made him refuse using a walker or hospital bed. He fought me on needing to use a hoyer when it was hurting me so much to try to lift a 240 lb man by myself. He refused hospice for a long time saying it wasn't time yet. He was asked repeatedly by his pulmonologist and neurologist whether he would choose to be on a ventilator and he always replied that he didn't know yet and that was his reply for years. He actually never made a decision about this and I had to at the end.  He would not discuss anything with me about funeral plans and I had to do this on my own without his knowledge.   We lived in our home that we loved for 28 years but I knew we had to move because there were so many stairs and he was suffering so many falls. At least he agreed to move but I had to pack the entire contents of a large house by myself and prepare the house for selling by cleaning and painting. Doing this and caring for him at the same time took a tremendous physical and emotional toll on me.  Not until about a week before he died did he seem to finally begin to have acceptance. He told me that he wanted me to give our daughter money from his IRA after he died. He told my daughter to get me out into the world again from which I had been isolated for so many years. He told her to get me to change my online passwords to different stronger passwords!  I do wish that things would have been different-- that he would have been less in denial and more involved in decisions but he just couldn't do that and I don't think I could have done anything to change that. I know this is very hard for both of you and for any other CALS facing this but as Max uses to say it is what it is.

46226,2020-05-11 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,Such important things being said in here and as CALS what we discover and learn to deal with is that no matter what anyone says we have to accept however our PALS decide to live and die this out. Some of them have FTD some just have cognitive and/or emotional changes some just respond because of the type of person they have always been.  I think that it is quite common for the CALS to feel very much pushed to the side no longer an equal partner. Often we just feel like less than the hired help.  Yet our task is so important - to advocate for our PALS to have what they want. When there is a high level of denial that is nearly a crippling task both emotionally and physically. I hear the pain and it is very real.  Really important that this thread is a CALS thread so their feelings and needs can be expressed clearly. We got your back.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-pals-and-denial.46226/
46226,2020-05-11 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,I am continually in awe of what so many CALS undertake.  Cristin am I understanding that even at the garage level where he is your PALS would need to navigate stairs to leave in an emergency? Is that why he hasn't been outside? Thinking about the wildfires I would certainly register him in advance with all the local EMS and firefighting units that keep such lists and with Smart911.  Another thought on the cleaning/packing/moving is that there are professionals who do such things -- I've done that twice -- and if you could find a property that would allow for more outside time/more rooms to be together perhaps his progression rate which if he is at rollator stage after 1.7y seems on the slow side plays into that decision also. Here and I'm sure most places home tours begin virtually and only proceed to physical tours if a buyer is serious and all precautions are taken.  That said I completely understand that staying put is easier and I don't know how hard it would be to keep the things that you value in your home from location to particular features-- just a caution that if leaving is literally dependent on stairs it will never in many ways be easier to make a change than now.  I'm sorry that you're facing this.  Best Laurie,True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-pals-and-denial.46226/

46146,2020-05-16 00:00:00,Thinking of You All,Thanks Sue and Lenore. As it turns out my pregnant caregiver decided to leave us. I think it was becoming physically too difficult for her and she was uncomfortable. She was kind enough to refer us to a person she worked with previously.  The new caregiver started last Monday and has been with us a week. She is a lovely Mexican woman and my PALS is Mexican so they sit and joke around in Spanish. I told him now you can talk about me in Spanish and I won't know everything you are saying (although I can understand a lot!). She is still coming up to speed and there are things that are difficult like using the hoyer lift and getting him in and out of the shower but she did fine. She is also older than the previous caregiver and exponentially more mature. Our previous caregiver was fine but very into herself; this woman seems far more engaged with my PALS (at least so far). Time will tell we all have our strengths and weaknesses.  I'm actually somewhat exhausted from the week as I have been more hands on than usual. He was in a bad mood yesterday as he wanted to see the Thunderbirds flyover so it was a bit of a rush to get him out of the shower dressed into his Permobil into the van and up the road to a good viewpoint. Luckily we were able to see them and they did a turn right in front of us. When he got home though he was irritable about his lunch and tired and a little snappy. It's to be expected. Can't say I'm not snappy at times.   So the new caregiver is a blessing and I'm happy we hired her.

After a crazy year of progression we’ve had the benefit of some stability over the last few months. The trach really did allow use to pause time in a way. Because we are still learning how to cope with the trach while my wife in a hospital setting perhaps that has also helped. Either way suction isn’t required nearly as often as I might have thought; and cough assist is twice/day minimum but sometimes the max is only 3 or 4. I will take your advice and keep trying to focus on one day at a time which really does help.,True,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/tracheotomy-again.46246/
46349,2020-05-27 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,"I received a request for my thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge from a Forum Member here. I attempted to reply to that message in my profile but could not post that message. Those that know me are aware that I don't often reply in a sentence or two. This was no exception and it seems I might have max'd out what could be entered in my profile area. So I'll post here refer to ""here"" back there and maybe a few others might gain some insight as they look to their own needs. So without another dozen words of preface here's my post...  Greetings Aziz!  In 2014 Darcey was evaluated by a local Speech Therapist and was recommended the Tobii. At that time Tobii and Dynavox were the two main choices. We were recommended the Tobii. We would later come to believe that the only reason we were pushed towards the Tobii was due to the fact that the Speech Therapist got along well with the Tobii Sales/Training Rep... and that this was the device that she was most comfortable with. About that same time Tobii was in the process of buying out the assets of Dynavox and merging it into their company. Tobii was so involved in the merger that they neglected their sales personnel and did not support them with after sales support of their new device users. Darcey received one training lesson and we were then left on our own.  For several months Darcey tried to find comfort with the Tobii. The first problem she had was one of getting the device calibrated to her eyes. For the times that she was successful with that she had difficulty with the software. Darcey didn't want much from the Tobii but it was still having difficulties giving her even those few things. Darcey's needs were as follows:   Facebook - she wanted to be able to continue using Facebook as she was able to do on a normal computer. She has friends from all over the world and Facebook was the mechanism that allowed her to keep in touch with them. Unfortunately Tobii's Facebook implementation was a joke.  Email - Darcey has a Microsoft Exchange Email account. She wanted to be able to read mail and reply to it... in addition to creating new mail items. Tobii's email implementation (as I recall) did not include an Exchange Mail component... only POP or IMAP. And while I could have converted her to one of the other formats she quit using the device before I could do so.  Online Ordering - She wanted to be able to continue to order things online. The Tobii really didn't do ""online"" well.  Entertainment - She wanted to continue with her Netflix and Amazon Prime Movies and Series. I don't remember if/how that was implemented with the Tobii.

46408,2020-06-08 00:00:00,Tired guiltystressed,My husband saw a neurologist in 2018 who listened to his symptoms and immediately suspected ALS. He refused to follow through with her. He was angry that she mentioned ALS and refused to see a doctor for over a year. The symptoms progressed and he finally saw another neurologist who confirmed the diagnosis in December 2019. He was seen at an ALS clinic in January. He had a g tube placed in March.  We have a part time aide 7 mornings a week.  He has lost the use of his arms. He can only walk with the aid of two people. He uses a BiPAP. He needs cough assist and suction many times a day. His anxiety and unhappiness are off the charts.We are close to signing up for hospice.  He (over?)analyzes every move we make and as a result of his cautious nature we always seem to be playing catch up with this horrible disease. We can’t sign up for hospice until he finally accepts delivery of his power wheelchair. We also need to have an appointment with communications specialists as hospice won’t cover the technology that he may need to communicate. This is after he refused appointments with these specialists in February because he believed the appointment would be too long and too taxing.  I am frustrated by the delay because we both need more assistance than we are getting. He needs different medications that will help with his anxiety and his breathing. His requests for help are nonstop and his criticism of the way the help is given is pretty much non stop as well.  The aide and I practically tiptoe around the house. He can’t tolerate chatting. I don’t cook any more because the smells bother him. He is unhappy when I speak to people on the phone...just quick daily check ins with our sisters and our sons.  I am sitting in our den with him now while he is sleeping in his hospital bed. Last night one of our sons stayed over so I did not have to get up to answer the many requests for help. I stepped outside to say goodbye to our son and came back in to an upset husband who said he had rung his button for help many times in the 5 minutes I was outside.  I know that five minutes is an eternity when you can not move but I do miss my freedom to do spontaneous things like walking out into a beautiful spring morning. Then the guilt comes rushing in he will never ever be able to do simple things that bring pleasure.,False,Dmaxwell,2020-05-31 00:00:00,2,CALS,2019-12-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Brighton,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/tired-guilty-stressed.46408/
46465,2020-06-15 00:00:00,Help planning bathroom please,Hello. I am new here. I need help planning a bathroom for my husband who was diagnosed in November. We are fortunate to be able to build from scratch. We have planned a large roll in shower with no barriers.  And I have read the advice that it may not be useable soon but then again progression is unpredictable and being able to shower is important to him. Builder wants to slightly slope floor 3 feet outside of shower for water that gets out. Shower is 6' w x 4' deep. Is this too big? Prefabs are 5' w but not sure if that will be tight with a tilting shower chair. Some other questions: If we will (eventually) be getting a PWC which presumably will be height adjustable is sink and counter height important? Same for workspace in the den. I know we need knee room under sink. I was advised about pull down grab-bars for toilet so they don't get in the way of someone helping and so toilet does not have to be against a wall. How much room is needed on each side of the toilet for helping to transfer etc? Is an adjustable height toilet helpful for transferring from and to PWC? Is it more important to have the sink or the toilet near the door from the bedroom? If sink is near door toilet will be on opposite wall with anyone walking into bathroom having a view of toilet. If toilet is near door it will interfere with the 8' turning radius I was advised about (Is that important?) Will I be sorry if I don't put the hoyer lift track on the ceiling. It seems like a bit much. I'm thinking we will go with portable lift when we need it. I know these questions are a lot. Any advice and experience would be very much appreciated even if you don't answer all my questions.

46226,2020-05-11 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,"Thank you for the reply Laurie and everyone else. He's actually up on the 3rd floor of the house (bedroom and office). So we would have to navigate stairs to the 1st floor with living room/kitchen/dining and then more stairs to get to the street level/garage. We considered chair lifts a few times but I understand that ALS progression will render them useless when he can't sit up on his own is that correct?   I have some friends who could help me pack but with the shutdown no one is supposed to gather in groups and I'm not sure any moving company would be working at this time due to the virus. Something we had already struggled with figuring out right before the virus hit was figuring out how to get him out of the house to allow prospective buyers to view the home. We were going to have one open house only and I was going to have to find somewhere to take him for 4 hours or so and hope that one of those people would put an offer on the house.   I honestly don't even know what his physical ability is on the stairs. It's possible he can still do the stairs. The problem is that he says he's too scared to do the stairs and just outright refuses to use them. I think in an emergency he could still get down the stairs and his wheelchair is in the garage. It's just when he looks at me and refuses to even try it's hard.   We do have a in-home physical therapist who has been coming over since mid-March right when the virus shut down hit. She has been helping with giving him some exercises to try but I don't think he actually does them regularly. All I can see is that he just sits in his chair and deteriorates in front of my eyes. It's so sad and frustrating because he says ""I'm not going to die!"" but will do almost nothing about it except take different supplements. The PT recommended a gait belt and I bought it but when I have offered to use it to help stabilize him on the stairs he refuses. Even the PT said she would use it on him and he refused her as well.   On top of that we got shipped a bipap machine. The pulmonologist said he should practice it 30 mins-1 hour each day to get used to it so he can start using it at night. However he hates using it and literally tells me ""this device is torture"" every time I put it on him. His breathing was maybe 70% the last time it was checked although it's been a while because we can't go get it checked now with the virus. I also read that early use of bipap has good outcome for pALS. But if he really keeps insisting he doesn't want it and that it's torturing him should I keep trying to use it and help him? Is it just a learning curve or am I torturing him?  V circling back to your original post my husband also took a lot of supplements over the years because he read certain articles about them. I've heard it speculated that some supplements could be a contributing factor to the onset of ALS and while I know that we don't know what causes it and it doesn't help us to speculate I still can't help it.",True,Cristin P,2018-08-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2018-08-01 00:00:00,US,CA,San Diego,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-pals-and-denial.46226/
46226,2020-05-11 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,"It's true that a lift doesn't work well when core strength is gone but while he has it you might be able to lease one which is pretty common.  I would not try the stairs if he is not sure of them -- that kind of thing tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy and a fall is the last thing he needs.  Moving companies are still operating under specified procedures. If you had a live buyer they would wear a mask and your husband could potentially stay in the bathroom while they explored then switch out. I'm not recommending one course or another just saying that they are both options. My SIL just bought a new house and moved into it; my own neighborhood is seeing a lot of sales activity right now.   BiPAP takes getting used to and is best tried while something else like screen time is going on. Settings can be adjusted masks can be swapped liners can be used to create more comfort. But it does take some interaction to get that right.   If you can talk honestly about the fact that refusing interventions and adaptations will both shorten his life and make it more ""torturous"" you may be able to shake loose some of the fear that is likely feeding his denial. And if he truly does not want to get outside when the sun is shining clinical depression (of which denial is only one manifestation) is a strong possibility. And for PALS who are at that level an antidepressant can indeed help if he can get there.   I am sure he loves your daughter so the memories that the three of you can still make that could be very important to her might be one approach to take as might be a third party like a trusted friend.",True,lgelb,2009-11-05 00:00:00,10734,Lost a loved one,00/0000,US,WA,Seattle,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-pals-and-denial.46226/
46226,2020-05-12 00:00:00,My PALS and denial,"Dear Cristin your story sounds so like mine except that we are older and no kids (PALS didn't want them). I have to say I have wondered about the supplements myself. He has always taken megadoses of one thing or another. My PALS has been glued to Nurown press releases as well and has been thinking he will get better once it is approved.   Have you by chance had the ALS Association over to look at your house? I know it's hard now with the current situation. They came over and we went over a lot of options to get my PALS in and out. They might be able to provide some suggestions for you. Another thing you could consider is renting out your home and renting a smaller one-story place. I have a friend who has MS and they rent out their house.  We ended up spending a lot of money on an elevator. I did move him into the bedroom/bathroom in October because the two steps up from the living/dining were becoming too hard for him. Being able to get my PALS outside even if it's only to the street in his Permobil is worth all the difficulty as it raises his spirits so much. There will come a time when the gait belt won't help you. My PALS is at that point. We have a hoyer lift now as he can no longer stand. Unfortunately you will have to think about these things in advance. The ALS Association can help you with loaners but for some things you will need a prescription and the Dr. will want to see him so at some point you will need to get him out of the house.   My PALS has been using the bipap for a year now. He was terrified of it at first but he was also experiencing a lot of CO2 buildup (in my opinion). It was as if he had dropped off a cliff. He was sometimes incoherent and unresponsive. The bipap made him feel a lot better and he was back to his old self. Unfortunately he is at the point where he needs it all the time and I have noticed he really struggles without it. You might try a nasal pillow although they don't work so well at night. A lot of people use CPAP machines does he have any friends who have one of those? Maybe they could reassure him it's not so bad?  My PALS had a call from an old friend over the weekend who did not know he had ALS. Sometimes people don't even understand what it is; they'll say things like ""I hope you feel better soon."" When he ended the call I could see he was upset by it. He told me later in the day that he saw a video on some new research development for ALS. Then he said it's probably going to be too late for him. I guess the denial is the only way he can deal with things internally; he knows he has ALS. It made me feel really sad. I've been having some difficulty lately emotionally with this seeing him struggling is painful.   Thanks for the encouragement and hugs from all of you. Don't know what I would do without them.

46349,2020-05-27 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,"Fortunately I'd been able to take a hobby of computers and turn it into a full time business. I had been consulting building and repairing computers since 1988. Leveraging that knowledge I set Darcey up with Dragon Naturally Speaking. With Dragon she was able to use her voice to control her computer just as if she were using her hands. As she was ""limb onset"" for ALS her voice had remained strong. This configuration held her for a good period of time. But in the fall of 2018 Darcey's voice was losing its strength and its clarity. She was having to repeat herself more and more to get Dragon to hear and understand. Something else was going to have to happen... and soon!    I began researching options. Sure Tobii was out there... and sure they'd likely improved their product in the years since we used one of their devices. But the memory of the experience was like a wall that kept moving me away from any thought of looking at them again. I became intrigued with what I was reading about a company called LC Technologies that produced a device called the EyeGaze Edge. When there was nothing more to read I picked up the phone and called the company. I spoke with James Brinton their Assistive Language Coordinator and a Speech Language Pathologist. We talked about our past use of the Tobii how we'd utilized Dragon voice dictation software and now needed to return to some type of eye control platform.    [Aziz... at this point you're probably realizing that I don't know how to make short simple replies. If you've searched back through any of my threads you'll find that I'm always on the ""says more than less... ALWAYS"" side of the equation. But if you reach out to ask a question then I know it is important to you. Most of us are hesitant to reach out for advice unless it become ""important"". And if it is important to you then it becomes important to me... and I don't want to shortcut you with a woefully inadequate response. So bear with me... I'm trying to give you the feel and benefit of my experience without you having to spend the time cost and frustration that I've already been through.]    James first reached out to a number of organizations to see if any of them had an Eyegaze Edge available for loan. None did. He then reached out to companies that had expressed some minimal interest in perhaps funding the purchase of one of these devices to then donate to someone like the ALS Association. He found someone with interest but couldn't promise it would happen any time soon. So I asked if we could buy one outright. He said ""Sure you can do that... but they run $12 to$15 thousand dollars dependent upon configuration."" He then suggested that I try contacting our insurance company to see if we could get a waiver on the 5 years they require between purchase coverage... and even gave me points that might help with our request. Though he didn't hold out much hope he did spend a considerable amount of time helping me with what might be persuasive to the insurance company. What felt good was that what he was suggesting I say was all truthful. There was not a single deceit in anything he suggested. The Eagle Scout in me appreciated that!

46349,2020-05-27 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,"Ultimately insurance would not budge and no loaner was available. We were going to have to bite the bullet and make this purchase out of pocket. Knowing how important Darcey's ability to continue to live through her friends was... versus simply surviving while waiting to die... took away any hesitation I might have on spending that amount of money... PROVIDED HOWEVER that it was something that would actually meet her needs. To that end we set up an onsite demo for a month later.    A week and a half out from our demo I received an excited call from James. ""Jim! Jim! It is entirely possible that you won't have to buy your own Eyegaze Edge. I've just had someone agree to purchase and donate to the ALS Association in Richmond... which is your designated Loaner Locker. And I've talked with the ALS folks and they've agreed to let you have the older model that is being replaced by this new one. Is that something you might be interested in?!?"" Of course I said ""YES!!!""   He said that it looked like they could still meet the existing scheduled demo... but make this a demo with a leave behind loaner unit if it met with Darcey's approval.    Let me take a moment to point out what I'm sure you've already noted. James had a virtual lock on a $12K-$15K sale in place. He could have continued with that still accepted the purchase/donation to the ALS Association and would have had TWO SALES IN THE BOOKS. But that is not what he did. He instead looked out for our best interests over an extra sale that would have been in his own personal best interest. Let me repeat - ""He Looked Out for Us!""    Darcey has been using this Eyegaze Edge for the better part of a year. But it is old has a smaller screen than the new tablets and can't be upgraded beyond Windows 8.1. Darcey is now on Medicare is past 5 years since her last purchase and it was time to seek something new. I called James and he suggested we seek a new evaluation from a local speech pathologist to get the ball rolling. I contacted Darcey's Neurologist who contacted the speech therapist who gathered a team together to work with us. A date was set and we teleconferenced. We met with an ALS Association individual (who we've worked with before) the Speech Pathologist associated with our hospital group and the area manager for Virginia from LC Technologies (Eyegaze Edge). It was a wonderful session. I'd already said that we were pretty sold on the EyeGaze Edge unless she (the speech pathologist) thought we should revisit Tobii prior to setting up a meeting. She said ""Nope... you already know both and have expressed a clear preference for the EyeGaze Edge. I don't know of anything that would likely change your mind.""    And so... here we are. We are within a few weeks of setting up a new EyeGaze Edge. It was approved by Medicare... and approved by our supplemental coverage with Anthem. Darcey would tell you ""The EyeGaze Edge isn't perfect... but it is light years ahead of what we had with the Tobii!"" Honestly Darcey would rather not have ALS and still be able to type and talk as she used to. But that isn't our reality. And so we... from day one... try to make the best of what is our reality and do so each and every day. We're excited to be getting this new device. And to be getting it from a company that demonstrated from our very first contact that they will ALWAYS look out for us first.    Aziz... I can't tell you what is right for you. But I can tell you our story... in the hopes that you'll find something in it that will help you with your journey... your choices... and ultimately with your decisions. Feel free to reach out with more questions... about this or anything else you think we might be able to help you with.

46349,2020-05-27 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,Jim thank you for your comments on the Eyegaze Edge. I have one that I received last fall. Our SLP determined I needed a device and that Medicare would pay for it. When I met with the SLP our local Eyegaze Edge rep was present and gave me a demonstration. It looked like something I could work with so I said OK. The rep then worked with me to handle the paperwork and get me my device.  Unfortunately the rep sort of dropped the ball with me after that. He help me set up the device and gave me a couple tips but basically disappeared after that and has not been accessible. I was able to contact Lori from LC Technologies in Virginia and she did provide some support but I would have wished for considerably more local support.  I will admit I have procrastinated in embracing the device waiting until I can no longer use my iPad. The eyegaze was easy enough to figure out for communication but I find using the internet challenging and I have not yet figured out how to set it up for email and texting. I have lost my voice but can still use my iPad with one finger though I am losing that. Very soon I will be forced to use the Eyegaze and will just have to figure it out. I also have an iPhone and I understand that the Eyegaze Edge syncs better with Android devices.  Would a Tobii have been better for me? Rumor has it that the Tobii is more cumbersome as devices go but that our local Tobii rep is very helpful. So I think there are various factors to consider in choosing a device with availability of local support being huge.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-thoughts-on-the-eyegaze-edge-vs-tobii.46349/

I think the fear and anxiety become overwhelming and turn into obsessive control. I'm glad you can recognize the guilt for what it is and try not to let it beat you up! You can't compensate him for what he's going through. You can only help him through it as best you can. And please do take that walk out into the spring morning! You need to restore your soul.

46408,2020-06-08 00:00:00,Tired guiltystressed,Dear Dmaxwell ALS is awful for both PALS and CALS. I understand how you are tired guilty and stressed. I've been here 4 1/2 years now.  It's important as a CALS to take care of yourself too. While I understand your PALS is demanding and has you on tiptoes if you aren't doing things to keep yourself going you will crash. Instead of feeling guilty about simple pleasures you need to look at them as giving yourself the strength to go on as a caregiver. Your telephone calls and walking out into the morning sun are important.   Hopefully once you are able to get him into hospice you will have more support. My PALS is a slow progressor and hospice is off the table currently so I don't have any experience with them but understand it helps a lot. It sucks that once you are in hospice you can't get the equipment you need but hopefully you will get through this period. We are here for you to be able to speak your mind.

46408,2020-06-15 00:00:00,Tired guiltystressed,"So sorry to hear about what you and your family are going through. My husband was officially diagnosed in January of 2016 (at the age of 47) and has been in the care of hospice for three years now. Like your husband he has had many changes in behavior personality and thinking. I have done much reading about cognitive changes / dementia with ALS and all of this is what I see with my husband. He is very unsettled throughout the day and night and needs everything done ""just right"" - from the way that I have to wipe his eyes in the proper u-shaped pattern to pointing his feet outward over and over again because it is not right the first time. When our nurse brought up hospice with us because of his breathing levels it was shocking to hear initially. However hospice has been nothing but helpful in so many ways. Our nurse comes weekly to check in. This eliminates the long and stressful trip to downtown Chicago to see his neurologist/doctor. The support of the social worker has been so helpful in dealing with the many behavioral and cognitive changes - and how they are impacting all of us including our kids. His meds have been tweaked over and over again. At one point he was waking up every 1.5 hours or so because of discomfort and being unsettled. With the help of meds he now sleeps through the night (for the most part) which makes both of us happy! For me it's always helpful to know that others are going through the same journey and challenges. We are here to help.",True,cfloriani,2016-03-31 00:00:00,5,CALS,2016-01-01 00:00:00,US,IL,Gurnee,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/tired-guilty-stressed.46408/
46408,2020-06-15 00:00:00,Tired guiltystressed,YES it is a very hard battle for both. We are in our 5th year. My husband has a power chair feeding tube cough assist and i gaze computer. He is 61. It is a battle to find good aides. The things that help me. I meditate mostly Deepak and Oprah 21 day meditations. I try to summon compassion be aware of what he is going through. He has a condom catheter for night time so I don't have to get up when he has to urinate. I just started putting a leg bag on in the daytime and that is really a help also not having to get the urinal every time he has to go. Just empty when the bag is full. There are so many challenges even with paperwork and phone calls cause nothing ever goes smoothly. We go to the ALS support group and that really helps meeting people with the same issues and making new friends. I just try to let things take care of themselves and not stress about what I can't change. Take some time for yourself and recharge as much as you can even if it's an hour because that is the most time we get and it helps. I try to accept that things will never be the same and just try to live the best we can. Most times it's overwhelming. We have no other choice but to get through it.

46465,2020-06-15 00:00:00,Help planning bathroom please,I recommend a pocket door or curtain for the entry to the bathroom.  The sloped floor is ideal. My setup has the sloped floor in the shower itself. We use shower curtains rather than a door.  The shower can’t be too big. Mine is roll in so I can actually use it as part of the turn around space for my wheelchair.  Grab bars in the shower help only while one can still stand and has hand function.  Knee room under the sink is important but you don’t want the sink too high or too far back. Pedestal sinks work well. Keep in mind most power wheelchairs can elevate if necessary to meet a slightly taller sink height.  My toilet has pull down grab bars one on each side. This worked very well when I could still stand and helped me to push up to stand. I have a tall toilet. Eventually my legs became too weak to stand from the toilet even with a commode chair placed over the toilet to add extra height.   If you want a bidet seat (recommended) put an electrical outlet near the toilet.  Ideally there should be enough space for the legs of a Hoyer lift to pull up around the toilet.  A turn around radius for the Hoyer is import.  I have a Hoyer (actually it’s an Invacare lift). This works well and I’m glad we didn’t have to track up our ceiling. I know people who have ceiling tracts and love them but they are not essential imho.  I eventually found the space around my toilet to be too limited for my spouse to get behind me to help me have a bowel movement. Now we Hoyer me to a commode chair with a bucket placed underneath.,True,KarenNWendyn,2017-07-29 00:00:00,3762,PALS,2017-07-01 00:00:00,US,OR,Southern Oregon,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/help-planning-bathroom-please.46465/

Now I use a lift and tilting shower chair which I transfer to in the living room or bedroom and get wheeled into the bathroom and over the toilet. i have a roll in shower that is sloped inside to a drain. i wouldn't slope it outside the shower it might make walking difficult  because it's uneven This is great and worth building. i could use my walker to get in and sit down on a shower bench. and now i roll right in with my shower chair. it is 5.5""x3.5"" with a 1.5"" bench and glass walls with a 2"" wide opening i didn't bother installing a wheelchair sink the storage you loose was to important to me. but do have a floating vanity so I get a bit more room to turn around. you definitely need room around the toilet for someone to help but if its not possible i just move the shower chair or commode to where there is room.",True,Trixie80,2014-06-21 00:00:00,116,PALS,2014-03-01 00:00:00,CA,BC,Abbotsford,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/help-planning-bathroom-please.46465/

46465,2020-06-16 00:00:00,Help planning bathroom please,Mine is a roll in but it was designed for progression. It has grab bars everywhere and a shower head at one end with a hand-held shower at the other end. There is also a pull down bench that can be used by me (now) or a caregiver in the future. The only thing I would do differently is put tile down instead of the flat roll-in material suggested by the company. It's supposed to not get slippery because there is a gravel coating but the coating has to be reapplied every six months to prevent it from becoming slippery. There is a rubber 2 inch entrance that keeps water in but allows a wheelchair or anything that rolls to go right over it.  I definitely recommend a bidet toilet seat. That and my lift chair are two things that have given me the best quality of life at this stage.   When I did the remodel I made each door 36 inches with the bathroom door 8 feet high. The 8 feet was suggested by the track salesperson because cutting will be much easier. I'm set up for the track system but will not have it installed until the right time. It will only take one or two days for completion because the configuration is all ready and lights have been moved.

I know what I feel but wouldn't tell someone else they should draw it where I would. Yet as PALS and CALS we find people seem to think they should weigh in on this - whether they would draw it closer or further away.  It is hard to say it but you do need to thank them for caring and then say it really is your decision together and you don't wish to discuss it in detail.

He is fundraising on the page through PayPal then claiming he is funding peoples' supplements. He also has a link where you can post your testimonials showing your dramatic improvement on this supplement.

I also checked out his website (another fundraising site) where he claims ""We have currently gifted over 300 pALS and after a recent survey of pALS gifted %51.7 have reported slowing of progress or improvement"".   I did see the thread here on the forum from last year discussing this supplement. I just paid my PALS' $400 credit card bill for this stuff. There must be money changing hands on this.

46349,2020-05-27 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,Thanks Jim. I appreciate the details. I bought the tobii pceye mini with the windows control software (like $1200). I was getting prepared for the eventual loss of hands and voice. I was able to use the Surface pro windows 10 tablet fairly well including web browsing in a standard browser. The biggest problem is you must be positioned in front of the device properly and it's not very forgiving if you get out of position. For the last 1.5 years I have been only been able to move my head. I have been using Enable Viacam (eViacam). It's a head tracking/head mouse program for windows. It's free and if you can move your head a few inches while sitting in a chair with a headrest and can take the time to setup and practice it's absolutely fantastic. As long as my head moves I will not be using eye gaze. It's much less sensitive to position. Just need a webcam. There is also an android version that's pretty good also free. If anyone needs help setting it up I am happy to help. I have attached my long description that I have posted a while back talking about home automation and how I have used technology. It might be helpful if someone wants to automate their environment. It was all written by me using Enable Viacam on a surface pro using the built-in webcam and my few inches of head movement. All the best everyone.,True,Jimi,2019-09-24 00:00:00,194,PALS,2015-02-01 00:00:00,US,CA,Torrance,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-thoughts-on-the-eyegaze-edge-vs-tobii.46349/
46349,2020-05-28 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,"Thank you so much Jim  appreciate the detailed response. you are absolutely right we usually hesitant to reach out for advice unless it becomes ""important"" .  Choosing AAC and choosing powerchair are two of the most important decisions we have to make and live with for a long time.  I've been back and forth between three choices : -Eyegaze edge  -Tobii new I-series( I-16) -Surface pro with PCEye plus from Tobii  I will be paying for AAC from my pocket   I'm from Saudi Arabia we have a good governmental free health system but it does not provide for AAC unfortunately.  Tobii new I-series has the advantage of being the latest so it's supposed to be fast and better. Personally from what I read I started to like Eyegaze edge better but it's old I believe this makes me a bit concern about it being out of date in terms of speed and performance.  I've read many people switched to surface pro with eye tracker I don't know how is their experience in comparison to Tobii or Eyegaze.  Fortunately I still have some time my voice is strong and I can function with my hands I will follow up with you Jim in a month or so to see how is Darcy's experience with the new Eyegaze.

46349,2020-05-29 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,"Wow! What wonderful additional comments. I'm sure that many can find useful items in these posts. As I said in my post... and as others have either said or implied... we can tell you about what we've been successful with (or had issues with)... but we can't tell you what is right for your own particular needs. I'm always glad to see people ask questions as Aziz (Amaw) did. Often we don't recognize the value of what we are individually doing that might be helpful for those who are looking ahead or having to make [now] decisions.  Karen - Darcey didn't immediately begin using the current EyeGaze Edge when she got it. She became easily frustrated with it and refused to use it. Then doing things by voice was simply easier and in her comfort zone. When her voice could no longer control the computer she had no choice but to move over to eye control. My son was a big help while he was home caring for me after back surgery. He sat down and used it himself to become familiar enough to instruct Darcey. When he returned home I had to learn how to perform the calibration. Now with practice calibrations are normally done in a minute or two with results between 0.10 and 0.19. And Darcey has become more and more comfortable using it for the various tasks that she requires from it. It is not perfect and we're hoping that the newer version will have some better controls.  Jimi - I hope you can see me standing and applauding all that you've done to maintain ""control"" of so many things/functions in your surrounding environment.

46349,2020-05-29 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,Update - Eyegaze Edge   Last night I signed the contract for a new Eyegaze Edge Talker. They now have two camera systems - one with a camera that focuses on a single eye (as we've been using) and one that focuses on both eyes. They recommended the single eye camera for Darcey as for her it would be easier to calibrate. The system price (Eyegaze Edge Talker) was $12500 USD... and another $3340 for a standing mount and a wheelchair mount. Total - $15840.00 We've been told that our Medicare (Primary) and Anthem (Supplemental) would cover 100% of these costs. We anticipate we'll see the new device in another 1 - 2 weeks.

46349,2020-05-29 00:00:00,My thoughts on the EyeGaze Edge vs Tobii,Wow. Is eye gaze hardware and software under the same rule as PWCs which I believe you can get one every five years.  I know the Gleason Foundation pays for some home technology equipment other than eye gaze but PALS pay the cost of installation.  What really bothers me is that Medicare only pays rent on Trilogies and the amount per month is very high. My supplement covers the rest but some vented PALS live for years using Trilogies and you can get two! One for your PWC and another for your bed.

My mum has had been losing weight for the past two years im overweight so i keep tabs on my weight and we used to watch our weight together. She was becoming steadily weaker since summer 2017 complaining she couldnt walk as she used to. She still was walking more than other women of her age. For about a year or so she was complaining of bitter and dry mouth and she started eating a lot of candies. In the summer we painted the house not sure if that affected her in any way. I started to notice her struggling during my birthday in June 2017 and also her weight loss had become apparent she also bended infront kinda shrinked. . She had no obvious health problem. She was super healthy apart from a back problem years ago. Now im remembering small details that seem worrying. Also many of those symptoms are happening to me now. Its crazy.

I had many slips like dropping stuff hitting my arms on equipment forgetting what I wanted to do. It helped to sleep more (if possible) and to get out and move. Swimming is my big thing. It doesn't stop the worrying but it makes the thoughts more flowing.  Have you tried talking to your mum via communication boards? As long as she can move her eyes and keep them open it should be possible although the concentration needed could be a problem if she's already having problems with breathing and is poorly oxygenated.

My main client was diagnosed with ALS in July and I am in the process of moving in with her for more 24 hour care. I wasn't planning on staying in this city except to wait out COVID but I've grown quite fond of this client and I can't leave her. She doesn't have any family willing to help her.  She is still able to speak and eat well but can no longer stand or move her fingers/toes. She transfers from hospital bed to power chair with a Hoyer and we just got a sliding bench for the shower. We are trying to get her body on a schedule so I can lift her onto the commode at certain times of the day (before or after my other client's).  She is able to urinate into a pad and then drop said pad into a bucket but bowel movements are very traumatic for her. She is very embarrassed and frustrated. She is also having sensitivity issues on her bottom from times when I wasn't available and she had a bowel movement in her chair and had to sit in it until I could get to her. It is painful for her when I clean her. Do you have any advice for someone in my situation? I'm currently working from 7am-9pm 7 days a week. I'm not sure I can maintain this for very long.

44731,2019-07-11 00:00:00,Sudden Bout of Incontinence,Ken15 said:    Post urology visit update: After an extremely thorough interview and examination including a stress test leak test (cystometry) blood test and microscopic urinalysis the Mayo doctor said she had bacteria in the bladder but otherwise no other significant issues. He doubled her oxybutynin dosage and once they typed the bacteria would issue a prescription for an antibiotic. The 2 bouts of incontinence were likely stress incontinence due to her hydrating for the clinical trial blood draws. There have been no repeats since then. Follow up visit scheduled for 3rd week in August.  PALS was relieved to have a conclusive analysis/diagnosis. With all the uncertainty surrounding ALS progression she/we didn't need the added issues of urological concerns.  As additional background over the last 9 months PALS saw 2 different   local   urologists (without positive results) and while each did some form of urine analysis neither came remotely close to the comprehensive examination she received at the Mayo. I was present for all examinations and unless you experience it first-hand I don't think you can really appreciate the qualitative difference.  Thanks for your comments and input Ken   Click to expand...    We had the same experience at Mayo. Night and day difference from the work up done at Barnes Hospital.

43607,2019-02-11 00:00:00,Shifting Sands...,"First my love and best to you all! Your care and attention provides a comfort and strength that is beyond explanation. Thank you!   When I last reported it was Saturday. Saturday night she slept a bit better but woke on Sunday feeling extremely light-headed. Taking her from bed to bathroom resulted in her feeling like she was going to pass out. Moving off the toilet resulted in the same feeling... so she asked to be taken back to bed rather than to the stair chair (to head downstairs for the day). As I was moving her back to the bed I could tell that she'd passed out. Once in bed with the sling removed I held her upright until she regained some sense. I took the sling off and made her comfortable in bed. She stayed in bed until mid-afternoon (when we did another bathroom trip and then headed downstairs).   That Sunday she had 4 Jevity... the most that she's ever taken in a single day. Since then she's had 1 or 2 Jevity each day. Her attitude seems to be better but she's not going to take the 5 Jevity that have been recommended. She did eat some canned peach slices during the week but nothing else by mouth.   On Saturday our son Jim was traveling to see us. He was coming by train. That is always an emotional booster for both of us. Darcey asked if I'd make her some mashed potatoes for dinner. I did that some green beans and a rotisserie chicken. She ate a very healthy helping of mashed potatoes and green beans... but no chicken. She just isn't comfortable trying to swallow chicken any more. Even the green beans are a challenge. But the mashed potatoes go down reasonably well. When finished she proclaimed ""I haven't felt this full in a long time. In fact I think I ate enough mashed potatoes that it is probably coming out around my stomach tube!"" I laughed certain that she was joking. But at bedtime when I checked her tube she said ""How much mashed potato came out?"" I think she was serious... or certainly appeared so by the tone of her voice and the look on her face. In retrospect she could have just taken me for a ride and was inwardly laughing herself!   So... where are we? Honestly I don't know. When asked she'll say that she doesn't know. So for the moment we're taking it one day at a time. It will be helpful to have Jim home for a bit. We've been babysitting his cat Gray since he last left. Gray will be heading home with him this time as he'll be driving his car back to Brooklyn NY. We'll both miss Gray... but having both Gray and Jim leave will be hard on Darcey. Fortunately we're not there yet.   I may have mentioned that I have a new puppy. Her name is Elise and she was born on January 23rd. She is a Coton de Tulear (same breed as Elsie who was with us for almost 13 years). I've attached some pictures of her.   So... one day at a time. We're all currently in much better spirits. Thank you for your patience in getting an update. I wrote one a week ago but had not finished. Upon returning to my computer I inadvertently closed the window and lost the reply. As any who has minimal time can attest to those kinds of events can be deflating.   So again thank you. I've just moved some serious HUGS into the ether. Take one feel my love and appreciation and pass it on. My best to each of you...

46881,2020-08-26 00:00:00,Is constant depression/anxiety “normal”,My brother has just past the 12 month anniversary of his diagnosis and continues to be (understandably) anxious and depressed. He is on meds.  Although his ALS specialist has recently stated he had classic limb onset ALS I believe it is respiratory onset since his presenting symptoms back in 2018 was shortness of breath and it took many months before any other symptom was apparent apart from long lead time and Unexplained weight loss (I think a symptom of respiratory onset ALS ). The Confirming EMG identified the paraspinal muscles. It probably doesn’t matter but it has me quietly questioning - there were delays in getting on to Riluzole before he started a trial because of doctors’ holidays or something. He’s still not on it. What else is not be covered or missed?  I think he is progressing quite slowly but there seems an attitude in his house that he should eat as little or as much as he wants and that interventions are pointless as appetite loss is a disease process an that he has no quality of life!! At the moment the biggest impact on his quality of life is his emotional state! Everyone’s situation is so nuanced and different. For example He has no appetite which to me is a reason to pursue a PEG but it was only through strong suggestions from me that it’s happening. Also he has had throat cancer so eating and swallowing has always been a bit of an issue which I feel is not taken in to account with an an assumption that he is actually further along than he actually is with a resultant attitude around him of “just accept - there’s nothing to be done”.   What a rave this is - don’t feel you have to respond  . I’m just letting of steam. My main question is about appetite. Is this the disease process? How do you determine what is anxiety-related appetite loss? I think he has lost weight because of the energy consumed with breathing but is appetite loss a result or a process?

46920,2020-08-31 00:00:00,Feeling less overwhelmed,Early May I posted feeling overwhelmed and several of you kindly responded and helped me calm. This is a belated thank you and I figured I’d just let you know where we are now.  Today my PALS turns 54. The same age his mother was when her ALS journey ended. It’s hard not to think about that. We’ll spend the day with our 28 25 and 20-year-old kids. Make the birthday dinner that he asked for and play Yahtzee. Not what we would have done pre-diagnosis and pre-COVID but it will be a nice day anyway.  A couple of you had suggested we be open and upfront with our kids. I agree that’s important and we have been right from the beginning. They’re part of the daily care and planning and have sat through virtual appointments with us. I couldn’t do this without them as Joe is 6’ 3” and 230 pounds while I’m 5’ 2”. I just can’t lift him or help him roll or move alone.  We worked with Dr. Harms at Columbia for genetic testing which has all come back negative. The kids do struggle some with the uncertainty and fear of the unknown future. I’m really not sure whether the negative is better or worse than knowing where their father’s and grandmother's ALS comes from.  Joe continues to progress quickly so I feel like I’m forever playing catch up. We have a great team through both the RWJ ALS clinic and the local ALS association chapter. He’s getting his PEG in the next couple of weeks. His wheelchair has been ordered and thankfully the ALS chapter is giving us a loaner until it comes in since he’s only walking with a person supporting on each side. We just need the ramp in first so fingers crossed that goes in this week. His Tobii has been ordered and hopefully won’t take too long. We have to ask him to repeat a lot of what he says and can often only get words through context. I think we were told we may be able to get a loaner so I’ll put following up on that on my to-do list. His Hoyer gets delivered tomorrow. We’ve got a shower chair ordered recliner chair that lifts commode adjustable bed inflating mattress pad and working on condom catheters. This has certainly been a learning experience for all of us. Anything else you’d suggest so I’m ready would be appreciated.  I’ve only posted a couple of times but I do read posts and find the sense of community and willingness to help amazing. Everyone’s journey is different but one point in common is that no one can do it alone.

44805,2019-08-10 00:00:00,My husband,"We have had some formally diagnosed they are all past CALS now tho I believe. My husband was not because there is no way he would have agreed to submit to testing and he would have been so furious with the diagnosis I felt it was a moot point. I was not going to spend the last months of his life arguing with him. His paranoia was huge and I was not going to escalate it. He would say to me - ""don't worry I'm not going to end up with dementia as well"".  It is hard to diagnose if they try to directly test the PALS. It is easier to diagnose if they choose the route of working with the CALS on the changes they are witnessing.  Keeping a diary of behaviours could be a wise thing for you to do but you may need to do this very quietly.",True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/page-3
44805,2019-08-10 00:00:00,My husband,Thanks Tillie. I have been keeping a diary of the progress of his MND right from the start and have therefore kept notes on the changes in his behaviour (not all of them but enough that I can put them into a separate page with dates and behaviours and take them to someone medical). The GP I spoke to (the one from the MND clinic) was very helpful and supportive but they just don't seem to have anyone on the team with any experience with FTD and the team psychologist suggested that his behaviour could just be emotional issues relating to diagnosis that haven't been dealt with. I know my man - well the man he used to be - and I am confident it is more than that. I only would like to know so that I can deal with the behaviours appropriately. In the meantime I am just watching everything I say and trying to avoid any topic that could trigger the outbursts. This doesn't of course stop the lack of empathy. The other day I cut &amp; bruised my hand; it was very painful and I showed him the injury expecting a little sympathy but he just looked at it with no expression at all and carried on watching TV. I have spoken to the manager of the rest home where he goes for respite care (in confidence) and explained some of the issues I have been having so she is going to do her best to make sure he has no cause for complaint while in respite so that he cannot have any reason to refuse to go in. Because of his paranoia that may not stop him having the perception that there is cause for complaint but we can only do our best. Thank you again for your support. I don't know if you realise just how much it has meant to me to have heard from someone who actually understands what it is like.,True,patientkiwi,2019-07-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2013-07-01 00:00:00,NZ,SI,Invercargill,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/page-3
44805,2019-08-11 00:00:00,My husband,@patientkiwi  I do understand what it means. When my Chris was showing all these behavioural changes I don't know how I would have coped with it had it not been that online I had 3 other CALS that were experiencing the same. We couldn't believe how identical the types of behaviours were as any one of us would recount something that happened that day. I broke my toe one day rushed into the bathroom and kicked the leg of the chair he would sit on to do teeth etc Same thing just a blank look at me then impatience at waiting for whatever he wanted done. But in this instance I then had weeks to heal. He became furious that I asked 2 of his adult children to come and help me the first weekend. How dare I expect them to give up their precious time off - I could just leave anything I couldn't do and the home care staff that helped during the week could do it Monday.  I can say this to you and you can laugh because I would never have said it to him in truth but I thought - oh ok so I can just leave you in bed til they come Monday can I?  Anyone that helped me at all during that time got huffs and eye rolling from him.  Now the point is not those things I just wrote. The point is that it was so startlingly opposite to his normal personality.  May I ask did you notice behavioural changes before the ALS symptoms?  That is a big one for me because Chris began behavioural changes before the ALS symptoms began so it wasn't a response to ALS.  That does however make diagnosing FTD difficult because of course there is an element of all the shock depression anger and grief. We as CALS are battling that as well but we should not exhibit a full change of personality and behaviours.  I tried not to analyse Chris too much and in the end what did it matter what was FTD and what was response to his situation anyway? It's not like if we could diagnose this we could cure it.  What I concentrated on was treating him with respect keeping his dignity and still giving him the choices and advocating for his choices. I did not get into arguments particularly ones of logic. I especially knew that as his memory was completely intact and his paranoia was high it was best to say as little as possible on hot topics or situations as he would filter them with paranoia and stack them on the pile and remember them no matter what other details he lost.,True,affected,2013-04-26 00:00:00,14022,Lost a loved one,2013-05-01 00:00:00,OZ,AU,lala land,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/page-3
46930,2020-09-01 00:00:00,23yr old CALS need advice work/life balance,Hi Michelle. Being an primary ALS caregiver is exhausting. Your client is fortunate to have you but you are going to need other caregivers to give you a break. She MUST get other help. If you read through old threads you'll see that spouses become completely exhausted and often compromise their own health. This is hard enough when caring for the love of your life--I don't know if I could have done it for anyone else. She simply cannot sit in her own feces. That tender bottom will because a mess of open sores--and you really don't want that.

46930,2020-09-01 00:00:00,23yr old CALS need advice work/life balance,Obviously your ALS client needs you and other caregivers. As others here already stated - be very careful. If you decide to become the main caregiver you will need other people. And even then it will be a very demanding task. You will burn out if you try to do this alone - and also if you put yourself into the position to have to do the night shifts. 24 hour care is hard to impossible. Depending how her ALS develops your night sleep will be so interrupted that you don't feel like yourself any longer. Try to find a balance that you will be able to maintain - which is hard to impossible as nobody can know how exactly her ALS will go and what she will need. It won't be less than she needs now and most likely significantly more like 3-4 times more.   I don't know anybody who would not have tender feelings about needing help going to the bathroom or getting cleaned up. If I may give you advice don't do this alone. For someone in her situation unfortunately it is the new normal. If you do too much it is all too likely that resentments will develop over time for being needed all the time. That is normal. If these get too strong you won't be able to do the care that you intend to give and that the woman deserves.

If she can still transfer to a commode chair that goes over the toilet (we use the shower buddy system which is wonderful but there are other less expensive commode chairs) I suggest getting a bidet for her toilet. My pals loves it and wishes we had installed one even before he was ill. It is great for keeping him clean. You could move her to there even If she has an accident before she can make it to the toilet and let it clean her much less irritating than manual cleaning. Having said that I second the folks who say she will need more help it is a very exhausting if not impossible job for one person. She can contact her local clinic for suggestions there are sometimes volunteers in certain cities that can help or they can suggest other avenues to pursue.,True,ARCG,2016-10-12 00:00:00,204,Lost a loved one,2015-01-01 00:00:00,US,TX,Houston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/23yr-old-cals-need-advice-work-life-balance.46930/
46881,2020-08-26 00:00:00,Is constant depression/anxiety “normal”,"Appetite is subject to the energy expenditure of the disease as well as the energy in living with immobility and struggling to make use of what is left including breathing. Likewise anxiety and depression are natural with the prognosis but also a consequence of the energy expenditure and pain that every day entails and often lack of refreshing sleep if positioning and breathing are not optimal.   Speaking of breathing is he on BiPAP? The work of breathing can sap mental and physical energy that could otherwise go to other things.   Even simple interventions like a better neck rest for a wheelchair or a change in pillow can save energy and improve mood.   And as you pointed out anxiety and depression can either boost or limit appetite. All of these relate so I don't think you can separate them.  Whether or not he opts for a feeding tube has to be his conscious choice. Meanwhile weight loss can limit the procedure's success so I would encourage an attitude of maintaining weight as a prescription for increasing the odds of a tube's being worth it if that's how he wants to play it. There are many ways to make puddings soups purees and smoothies a weight-gain diet.   The problem with the ""eat whatever"" philosophy wherever it comes from and however it's enabled is that even if he gets a tube someone else presumably will be responsible for some aspect of tube feeding and a ""however/whenever/whatever"" attitude could lead to more weight loss. So that would be my first line of attack -- trying to understand the roots of the fatalism you describe.

46920,2020-08-31 00:00:00,Feeling less overwhelmed,Happy birthday Joe!  it sounds like you are doing a great job and happy you have your kids working with you.   Did Dr Harms recommend banking his DNA? If he does have an undiscovered mutation as opposed to a general genetic susceptibility and bad luck it would allow testing later as more FALS mutations are found.   I think the Columbia study of ALS Families require an identified mutation for participation DIALS in Boston does not though they MIGHT need more affected relatives. However if any of your children are interested I can give you a link. The purpose is to find biomarkers that manifest before disease.,True,Nikki J,2012-03-22 00:00:00,11246,PALS,2014-04-01 00:00:00,US,MA,Boston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/feeling-less-overwhelmed.46920/

44805,2019-08-11 00:00:00,My husband,Thanks Tillie. And you are right - if I just focus on treating him with love &amp; respect even though he is not reciprocating and is treating me with anger &amp; indifference hopefully I will provide a stable anchor for him. That is my goal anyway - often easier said than done but I will do my best.   In hindsight I believe that there were subtle changes occurring prior to his diagnosis. About 18 months before the physical symptoms became apparent I had seriously considered leaving him because I felt he was becoming very controlling. It is too long ago now (about 9 yrs) with so much that has happened in between that I can't recall what other changes there were if any. In the end I decided to stay with him because I wasn't convinced that I wouldn't regret it if I left and now I am glad I did because I could not have lived with myself if I had left him and then this had happened and he was on his own. And his current behaviours are so different to the man I have loved and lived with for over 40 years. He was always a loving and romantic husband very caring and supportive; never raised a hand to me and seldom raised his voice even when we had the occasional argument. I wonder if that isn't what makes his current behaviour so hard to deal with - because I have known such love and support from him and that has all gone.,True,patientkiwi,2019-07-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2013-07-01 00:00:00,NZ,SI,Invercargill,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/page-3
44805,2019-08-11 00:00:00,My husband,yep the behavioural changes start very subtly and build slowly and insidiously. becoming controlling is a common thing to notice in the early stages.

I feel I am losing ""Me"" because I am trying to be who he wants me to be just so that it keeps the peace. I have been in email contact with one of the doctors at the MND clinic - she is very supportive and is going to talk to my husband's neurologist to see if he can have a 'review' appt during which the neurologist will do a discreet assessment.

With ALS the best doctors can't know if it will be 1 year three years five years or more. Each PALS is unique and there are ways to extend life beyond the usual 2-5 years life expectancy if one desires.

We are in NY and my PALS' primary care physician (also the local ALS Center's doctor) always comes to our home. She is amazing. She couldn't visit for a while during early COVID but now that NY has a pretty good handle on things she is making in home visits again. Visiting nurses are coming here as necessary now as well. Please check in with your brother's local ALS Center or contact the ALSA Upsate NY Chapter office in Syracuse for advice if your brother is upstate. Not sure about downstate. Happy to message with you too if I am qualified to do so...don't know the rules on that. Anyway...wishing you and your brother all the best.

Crystal I'm going to disagree with Jonico a little that no one can distinguish between one-year and five-year survival. There are models on line based on published research your doctor can provide more clarity and prognostic factors such as age of onset type of onset early deterioration rate etc. are well-established though not set in stone.

46820,2020-08-24 00:00:00,Crystal’s thread,Dear Crystal sorry to welcome you here. We are heading toward our 5-year anniversary since diagnosis.   Take it from me the Hoyer lift is your friend! We started using one about 9 months ago and it has saved both of us. I still have to use my back and muscles during transfers to make sure he is situated properly but I am much smaller than my husband and there is no way I could have lifted him. It's easy to use once you get the hang of it. We have 2 slings it took a little experimenting to find out which one would work best but we have one for most of the transfers and one that we use for the shower that gets wet and is a split leg. He fell twice in our home before I insisted that he allow us to use it. Now I'm so familiar that I had to show the nurse in the hospital how to use it with his sling.  I'm sorry that your husband has become nasty tempered and also sorry that his progression sounds very slow. My PALS is sometimes very demanding and irritable and I hate to admit we have had some arguments about it. I can't imagine how it feels to not be able to do anything you enjoy and not be able to move your body to help yourself and I don't suppose I would be any more even tempered. We are both on anti depressants I could not function before I started taking one.   The forum has helped me deal with this monster. I've gotten so much support and advice here.

44805,2019-10-10 00:00:00,My husband,Hi Everyone. Just another update. Haven't had any dramas for several weeks and he has been quite stable. Now I am second guessing whether he does have FTD or not. If they have FTD can they control their behaviour? His behaviour right up until a few weeks ago was so much like FTD that I had no doubts but I just don't know now. So I am just enjoying the relative peace while it lasts. There have been other periods where he has been stable (personality wise) but usually for a much shorter period of time. Hope you are all doing well.,True,patientkiwi,2019-07-22 00:00:00,17,CALS,2013-07-01 00:00:00,NZ,SI,Invercargill,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/page-3
44805,2019-11-27 00:00:00,My husband,I understand my husband developed the FTD first I think looking back. My children were in high school when his personality changed. I brought it up to him one evening and he broke down telling me he thought something was wrong. I chalked his hair trigger temper up to his concern. i made him go to the doctor and he was misdiagnosed for a couple hears before the ALS diagnosis. He is also a slow progressor but in the last six months his temper has waned or I am getting used to it idk. It is a hard road. I don’t have any answers My husband also insists he is not depressed and doesn’t ‘believe’ in depression. But I think anger is a symptom of depression. We also have good days however the issues with life in general don’t take a sabbatical just because he has ALS so I am always juggling. Because he is somewhat bored he comes up with things he wants me to do which have nothing to do with his illness but he makes a priority adding to my workload. I love him very much and it breaks my heart sometimes as while I think he loves me he’s sees me more as a caregiver now and not as his wife,True,ARCG,2016-10-12 00:00:00,204,Lost a loved one,2015-01-01 00:00:00,US,TX,Houston,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/my-husband.44805/page-3

My husband on his swift and devastating trajectory through ALS and FTD has suddenly become unable to hold his pee (so far it's just pee but the other is coming surely). I bought a pack of Depends just in time yesterday after a few accidents. Awoke this morning to puddles of pee on the bathroom floor &amp; hallway rug. He travels about the house on a walker so I expect him to be mobile for a while yet.  He can't talk and the FTD is advanced enough he's not able to communicate when he has to go. But I think his loss of muscle/nerve control doesn't give him any warning anyway.  Looking for advice about how to keep the house carpets and him clean (&amp; me sane) in this in-between time after incontinence sets in and before he's completely bedridden.

46970,2020-09-11 00:00:00,Seeking tele-counseling or video chat emotional support,Hello hello--  I have just joined this site and this is my first post. I am in need of a therapist or group for support via video chat.  I am trying to take care of my mother who was diagnosed with ALS five years ago. She is well into stage 4A but is very hesitant to have a tracheotomy. I was able to keep my job before but now I cannot even leave the room where my mother is. With the way my family works I am the only person in the family who can look after her. I am with her all day and all night. Recently we hired a part-time nurse who helps at night. This is a big help but it is not enough particularly emotionally.   I live in a small town in southern Thailand. There are no hospice organizations here. There are no ALS organizations in Thailand. There are no such support groups. While I am able to physically take care of my mother I am in desperate need of emotional support. I have never faced taking care of a dying person and I don't know anyone at all who has dealt with ALS. I have been doing this for one year now and I feel like it is destroying my soul as I watch my mother's body be destroyed. My love for my mother now competes with recurring hate for destroying my life.  I am hoping to find someone or a group who can help me through this someone who understands ALS. I am truly at my wits end. Thai language would be best for me of course but such counseling simply isn't available in Thailand so I have gone to the internet to search for counseling in English. While I prefer Thai English is fine for me. It is more important to me that the counselor understand and have experience with ALS than speak Thai.  Please tell me if you know anyone or any groups with whom I could do a video chat counseling with. Any leads would be incredibly useful to me.

45661,2020-02-03 00:00:00,Trach issues,We have had frank conversations but in the midst of it being a real-life issue it’s hard to consider with any sort of clarity.  Jonico thanks for your reflections; you seem to have been in one of the most similar situations to ours so it’s helpful. My wife is in her early 40s and I’m younger so this has thrown us for a loop and hence the possible attraction of a trach. Unfortunately so many things have gone so quickly that I can well imagine the eyes following that pattern. For example until Christmas (2019) there were few speaking and swallowing issues but within a week of issues arising this hospitalisation was brought on. Eye movement issues and FTD have been identified as possible risks and they weigh heavily on me at the moment.   Lgelb thanks also for your very asute and helpful comments which gave a difficult conversation some focus and parameters to work with.,True,Weltschmerz,2019-04-14 00:00:00,57,CALS,2019-01-01 00:00:00,UK,SC,Edinburgh,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/trach-issues.45661/page-2

Truth is it's really a huge grind...but there has also been beauty in it. I've hit a wall and want it to be over now. She wants to live longer which I admire greatly and understand. Sometimes I am jealous of others whose PALS passed earlier (with no trach my wife would have passed 3 years ago) but I press on and am convinced that when all this is over I will look back very favorably on the extra time we shared together.  I'm out. I know you will and your wife will make the best decision for both of you.

This past week I noticed my PALS has had difficulty with her lips so I asked and she cannot now open her mouth properly. I hadn’t thought of that as a possible deterioration.

39014,2017-07-22 00:00:00,Struggling,Time alone is indeed precious esp right now with my folks here too.    Dad is getting better physically mentally there will remain issues that will probably only get worse.  Went to the therapist today. It was a good session. Got some action items and have already checked one off and have the second one half done     The first item dealing with my folks and my brother and figuring out what's best for them going forward. I texted my brother when I got home about that. He said he had planned to come over this afternoon anyway. We did have a good convo with the folks. Mom was already on board with a single story and dad seemed ok with it as well. Step one accomplished. We are working toward seeing how much they can do this week on their own and then delving into their finances so we know what we have to work with. That will dictate our choices. My brother also realizes that he and my SIL will have a large roll there since I'm kind of tied down. He actually brought that up. So we have a plan set up there. Hopefully the PT will get here this week and give us their assessment. My brother did walk dad without the walker and he did really well. He also had him do a step. Then my brother will be back here next Sat to see where we are.   Next item is to have a written schedule that our daughter can lean on showing who is here when to help me to calm her going forward. That mean contacting our son so he and I can set something in writing and then the two of us meeting with her to go over it all and reassure her. Spoke to our son tonight and that will happen soon.  Ok I know those things don't seem to focus on me but they take things off of my mind. It was interesting because the therapist día ok we talked about you daughter and your folks now what do you want to get out of this what do you need. That was hard. I told her truthfully that was hard because I had been doing this so long. I did say getting in my walks for exercise and stress relief getting groceries. It's still hard to think of things that are really me centered. As a mom if my kids are happy that makes me happy. I really have to work on that.   All in all this will be good.   It was a good day.

39014,2017-07-23 00:00:00,Struggling,Sue that is brilliant - I found it so invaluable to have that time where it was all about me. It wasn't really whining about what was going on but discussing what was happening and how it impacted on me and strategies for me. I do think every CALS would benefit so long as they can find someone they click with and who 'gets it'.  Sooner I think getting them involved as early as possible is really important for everyone. Very often it becomes too scary to try and help our PALS if people are not helping out from early and get to learn with changes as they happen. If they were to suddenly be asked to help once a PALS is completely dependent it can be really daunting. If they are helping and over time the PALS reaches that point it's just how it is.

Some ideas off the top:  Use a condom catheter if he will keep it on Proactively ask him to go at regular intervals if he can comply with that in an easy way like using a urinal. Keep urinals around the house and try to help him acquire the habit of pointing to one when needed.  Use large absorbent pads in bed There are various absorbencies/styles of Depends and maybe better brands -- I would check reviews for his particular situation.

46895,2020-08-31 00:00:00,Help with incontinence?,Laurie has some great advice. I'll add - wash urine from clothing as soon as possible in COLD water. Use Borax as well as your detergent to reduce the odour. Since he can still stand use pull-up style diapers or pads to make things easier to change. I find Tena Ultimate Overnight pads to be the most absorbent if you want to go the pad route. Aim to have him go every 3 to 4 hrs.

46895,2020-09-11 00:00:00,Help with incontinence?,"With his FTD he doesn't comprehend cooperating on use of a condom cath. He just pulls it off when he's done and it spills on the bedroom carpet.  He wakes every 60-90 minutes at night to stand up and pee into a urinal. As soon as I get his pad pulled down I'd better be there with the urinal in the right spot or else!

The major caregiving needs started about 18 months ago.   Your words are so true I am overwhelmed with sorrow for him and also hate what this illness has done to both of our lives. I am wondering with Covid19 these days are Thai doctors doing video visits? Perhaps you could find a therapist who can help you if so.  Regardless I have found everyone here to be so kind and supportive. I have gotten help here with my husband's needs and also just help from others who know what this is like. You are not alone. People here have allowed me to vent to be angry to be sad and to not lose sight of myself and my husband as people. You are doing the hardest job and we are here for you.

41449,2018-06-26 00:00:00,Hold on Tight...,It’s the ultimate no-win situation. Every little loss brings with it a little decrease in quality of life for our PALS a little increase in the effort and energy required to take care of them.   I am constantly amazed by the cumulative impact of this disease - it creeps up slowly and yet seems to descend with such a great force. As things slip away and everything gets more and more difficult all we can do is the best we can to give them moments of happiness where we can even though they get harder to find. I hope you can take comfort in knowing that you are an amazing CALS Lenore and that you do that for Brian everyday.   I don’t know how I would feel about having a date but I can’t help but think it’s a good thing for a Brian to be able to take control of that and make that decision for himself. Ultimately I expect my PALS will make the same decision. I will understand and support him but I doubt that will make it any easier. Wishing you lots of strength and big hugs.

40910,2018-07-15 00:00:00,Venting tomorrow---which will surely cause more venting,"Hello again dear friends. I've been away too long I know.   We came home on the 4th of July and I've had to take a stand to keep him here.  Matt had some delireium in the hospital and he even got pretty harsh with people. It was sporadic and the docs thought it would clear up when we got home.  Nope. It didn't. It just got worse and when I contacted his Va PCP to ask for an order for home health to draw blood urine and sputum he response was to tell me to take him to the ER. NOPE. Until those tests were run there was nothing they would do that we weren't doing at home. Fortunately our local PCP agreed to do all the testing--we got all the samples in Friday.  Then Friday night I prepared his 10pm meds...methadone gabepentin and Tylenol but forgot to give it to him. He slept all night and woke up lucid. So remembering that Gabipenten made him mean a couple of years ago I stopped it and cut his Methadone to 1/4 tablet instead of 1/2. Another wonderfully lucid day with no complaints of pain.  Note that we did not tell him we've cut or reduced anything because we've learned that he has a lot of anticipatory pain.  Still holding the Gabipentin but I did move the Methadone back to the prescribed 1/2 tablet this morning to see how that works.  His 02 has been falling and we've got him on anywhere from one to two liters of oxygen. The RT says we've about maxed the vent and that this may be disease progression but I'm also thinking it may be the Methadone...so I'm tracking what happens today.  He has completed the IV antibiotics (a total of three bacteria grew from the cultures and we went through 3 or 4 different antibiotics because of that and elevated something or another) and is now doing Inahaled Tobyrimyicin (sp?) daily indefinitely. Infectious Diseases is now following and controlling that.  There is another piece of equipment on order. IPV therapy worked very well in the hospital. It sends bursts of air into his lungs at different frequencies over 20 minutes (I have to turn it manually) and it forces mucus out of the lungs and opens up the sacs even better than the cough assist. Here's the drill...Nebulized DuoNeb with Saline IPV for 20 minutes (with Saline to keep things moist) cough assist suction then nebulized antibiotic. It kept him clear all day. I'm going to follow up tomorrow to see when it should arrive.   Our youngest son came back this weekend with his wife and our two year old grandson...it was wonderful to see them. I had a nurse here and was able to spend the day int he lake with them.   Also under the heading of ""I'm not playing your games any more""--the HHA sent a new aide out yesterday. She called from the street (rather than walking down the long driveway to the house) to make sure she was in the right place. Then she asked if we had dogs. She said she doesn't like dogs. I offered that they are friendly and we can try introducing them and her reply was that she's not afraid of then she just doesn't like them. She wanted them shut up while ""she did her work"". Four hours. Not. I told her it was clearly not going to work out and thanked her for her time. I literally heard her jaw drop over the phone.  I've told the agency not to send anyone else out who will not be a regular because it's harder to train them than to do it myself. She was supposed to be ""checking to see if she wanted to come back"". I was a bit suspicious of that to begin with.  If the driveway and the dog were too much for her imagine what she'd have said when she got a look at Matt.   It is wonderful to be home!!!!

I don’t want the whole “cat allergies” thing and if my little yapper freaks you out please leave. I got a taste of people acting like my friendly 11 pound dog was going to kill them and the “cat allergies” chat and said nope no more.  My husband nixed an aid because he felt she was rushed and perfunctory. She showed up late and wanted to leave early. Yikes.  The beauty of hospice is we can say no to the hospital by default. Unless I cannot control pain here he is not going there. A recent sinus infection was diagnosed at home and medicated at home. We don’t even do Drs offices.Blood draws/ labs right here.

46895,2020-09-11 00:00:00,Help with incontinence?,My husband had Alzheimer's and was in a memory care facility for the last months of his life. Many of the residents including my husband had issues finding the toilets or remembering how to use them. So they had him in Depends as well as a one piece suit that zipped up the back - so he was not able to get it off by himself. It was basically a pair of sweat pants on the bottom and a T-shirt on top sewed together at the waist. We would take him to the bathroom often And it was very easy for us to get the suit unzipped and pulled down for him. If he did have an accident it was contained in the Depends.  You can get them mail order from a company called Buck &amp; Buck.,True,Fusia,2019-10-26 00:00:00,150,PALS,2019-08-01 00:00:00,US,MT,Big sky country,https://www.alsforums.com/community/threads/help-with-incontinence.46895/
