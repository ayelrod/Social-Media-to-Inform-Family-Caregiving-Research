{"post_id": "471716", "title": "How could I SAY that?", "body": "So this isn't so much a question as it is something I need to get off my mind or I'll go crazy. My mom (65) has had two strokes this year and at least in my opinion although it hasn't been diagnosed yet is suffering from dementia of some kind. I have lived with her since 2005 and although we had a great relationship we are both hot-tempered and have had our share of fights. After mom had her second stroke and it was clear that she would need full-time care I turned down a well-paying new job and have since devoted myself to caring for her alone. This has been since October 18th of this year and I am ashamed to say it but I have already had like four or five meltdowns. And I'm talking screaming crying hysterical meltdowns to the point where I've wanted to kill myself where I've wanted her to die where I've said incredibly terrible things and punched walls and actually threw and broke a portable grill on my kitchen floor. I have accidentally put bruises on my mom's wrists because I was trying to stop her from kicking me (again) and felt so guilty about it that I contemplated contacting my aunt to come take care of her because I thought I was unfit. I have said things to my own mother like \"I hope the next stroke kills you!\" \"I wish you were dead!\" \"I regret brining you home from the hospital!\" \"I hate you!\" and so on. I have felt instantly guilty when these horrible words burst out of me I have apologized and my one saving grace is that my mom doesn't remember any of this but I do and it breaks my heart and will be a stain on my soul that no amount of time or forgiveness will ever get rid of.  So in my dark hours lying awake in bed at night after another long and miserable day of trying to take care of this woman who I love more than anyone else and who I would do anything for I ask myself one question over and over...How could I SAY that? How could I say these things that no human being should ever say to another? How could I say these things to my mother who is the most amazing person I've ever known who raised me and loved me and made my childhood happy and safe? How could I get so angry at this person who is clearly sick and can't help it? How can I even think these things about my mother who deserves so much better than this than me? I have tortured myself with these questions and so many more. I have felt guilt so raw and intense that it cripples me and keeps me from getting out of my chair and makes it so I can't sleep. I thought I would die from the weight of the shame I felt. But then I started to answer my own questions and I'll tell you how I can say these things that are horrible and that I don't mean. They come from fear from exhaustion from sadness and desperation and resentment and feeling trapped. These words come from anger and guilt and stress and not knowing how long this situation is going to last or how bad it will get. These words come from having to give up my job my life and some of my sanity to take care of a woman who can be childish mean-spirited combative and aggressive. These words come from being sick of changing diapers and cleaning sheets and being kicked and grabbed and having to fight her for every inch of everything. These words come from the exhaustion of just trying to get her up and clean and dressed for a doctors appointment and knowing that it is going to be a struggle the entire way because she is completely unmotivated to do anything. These words and feelings come from knowing that when I try to give her her meds she'll most likely slap them out of my hand again. These words come from her lack of hygiene and having to deal with her horrible breath and dirty hair and having to wash her in the shower. These words come from having to clean down the entire bathroom at least twice every day and trying not to gag on how disgusting it all is. These words come from grief and the loss of our lives being happy and free.

{"post_id": "471716", "title": "How could I SAY that?", "body": "You can't do this anymore; you're burned out angry &amp; resentful for all you've given up like your entire LIFE to care for your mother who's actually quite young at 65. She can live another 2 or 3 decades and where does that leave YOU? You need to think about the next step here; how to get mom on Medicare and then apply for Medicaid to get her placed because you can't and shouldn't go on like this; it's not healthy for either one of you. Keeping mom home has to work for BOTH of you and clearly it's not so something has to change. Having meltdowns doesn't mean you're a bad person; just that you're an exhausted and burned out person and rightly so!   I grew up with a mother who agreed to take her mother into our house and they did not get along. My mother was extremely resentful of having my grandmother living with us and it wreaked havoc in the house all the time. Nobody was happy. Mom should have made other arrangements for grandma so that BOTH of them could have had a better life meaning ALL of us would have had better lives; dad and myself included. Instead she felt like she 'had' to keep grandma in our house out of some misguided sense of duty when grandma would have been better off in a nursing home! Ultimately mom cried uncle and sent grandma off to an aunt's home to live and the aunt said No Way and sent her to a nursing home where she did fine. She lived to be 91 and died in her sleep one night peacefully with a smile on her face. It should have been done YEARS earlier.  Please take your life back and allow yourself to HAVE a life now. You deserve to. If I had to live with and care for my mother I'd have shot myself honestly. I could NEVER do it in a million years! She lives in Assisted Living since 2014 and in Memory Care since 2019 thank God. She's doing fine and I have enough on my plate managing her entire life finances doctors etc! I care for her but no hands on care which makes a big difference. We can maintain a fairly decent relationship that way otherwise we'd be at each other's throat 24/7!!

In fact take mom to the ER for that UTI and refuse to bring her home. The SW at the hospital can help you find placement for mom.

I see you say Mom has not signed up for SS or Medicare if she hasn't you need to find a way to get it done. Both can be done online I think. If Mom has any money use it. My Mom had 20k. I applied for Medicaid in April placed her May1st and she privately paid May and June. June I confirmed with the caseworker that Mom was spent down her money and I supplied all info needed. July 1st Medicaid started paying.  You don't need to physically care for Mom. All you need to do is make sure she is safe and cared for. My Mom was in my home then an AL and finally in LTC.

There is no reason on God's green earth why YOU should be required to 'live poor' after 15+ years of caring for mom in your home. Why would you be private paying for her facility? Does she have too much money to qualify for Medicaid? If so SHE should be spending down HER own money to private pay rather than you! If she has no money then she qualifies for Medicaid long term care NOW.  Go speak to a certified elder care attorney to get the REAL 411 about what to do before YOU go bankrupt for no good reason.

People are not let go because their care is costly and unpleasant and family doesn't get a vote in when it is time for the person \"to go\". Only the patient can decide when it is time and the patient must first go through psychological testing to be certain that the person understands what he is asking and that this is what the person wants. Dignitas which is the one often used (about 10000.00 for the entire process) demands that you have thorough paperwork and interviewing that this is your wish. The one difference between there and here is that you don't need the \"6 months and you will be dead\" rule nor do you need to have a diagnosis of a life-taking disease. You can merely be OLD and request this. Or you can be facing down a diagnosis of dementia and ask for this. But you cannot HAVE dementia to the extent you are no longer mentally competent.  I agree with you that I wish we had a \"Dignitas\" here. As an old retired RN I very MUCH wish it were here. You should not be paying for your elder's care. What will happen when that money you are spending is not there for your own age? Who will pay? Just listening to how many veterinarians take their own lives on an NPR program the other day; animal care is so difficult and so heartbreaking. But the thing they feel most enables them is the readily available medications to do it. One in six vets they say will eventually relieve themselves of their own lives with their own medications. This indicates there may well be many out there who would be willing now to exit this life.  I think that law will loosen in our own country when in future given our current birth rate we have many more seniors \"living too long\" who have no one to care for them and the \"system\" cannot sustain the cost of ongoing care that doesn't help but merely keeps alive the living husk of a being who is suffering and ready to go.

The biggest part of taking care isn't managing her physical needs it's her emotional ones. Every interaction she has with another person has to be analyzed. She thinks most people don't like her or are out to get her. She monologues about her childhood every day. She likes to tell me what I'm doing wrong or that I'm not really talking with her so this must mean I'm not a Christian. She has debilitating bouts of depression that make her irritable and negative.

No one has to sit and talk to someone all day long. If you don't want to talk to her walk away and ignore her. This is what I do every day. You mother very likely is trying to get you angry to get a response from you. This is called instigating. Seniors do it all the time because many are bored and want someone to fight with.

{"post_id": "474034", "title": "Where would you run away to?", "body": "I have 1 daughter &amp; 1 step daughter who could both chew the ear off a brass monkey. I can't tolerate it really. When my DD was a child she didn't say a word until she was 3. The family (on my ex's side) were all so worried OMG there was something WRONG with her they'd say over and over again. I knew otherwise. When she turned 3 she started talking in sentences and hasn't shut up since; she's now 29. As a child I'd tell her 'I need 5 minutes of silence now dear.' That was the rule; we'd start out with 5 minutes of silence and work our way up to 10 and 15 from there. It was while driving I'd ask for the silence b/c it'd drive me up the WALL to hear her constant chatter while trying to focus on the road!   My step daughter now calls my husband and literally keeps him on the phone for 2 hours or more; I have no idea how he does it. It takes her longer to TELL a story than it took for the incident to HAPPEN!   So you want peace I understand that intimately. What I do not understand is why you are living with your mother who drives you insane? A child there's no choice about a mother there is. Using the \"you must not be a Christian b/c you're not doing things MY way\" BS against you is hitting below the belt. Having dramatic mood swings run-on monologues and the need to micro-analyze every personal interaction she has sounds like mental illness to me. Not to mention 'debilitating bouts of depression' and non-stop chatter. My mother was like this to a large degree which was one of the many reasons I could NEVER live with her again after childhood. Once was more than enough. She too could not have a moments silence while together; I believe she couldn't stand her own company and had to fill every moment with idle chatter just so there WASN'T a moment to THINK or to feel alone. That's my 2 cent psychology on the matter. My mother's mental illness was apparent since I was a very young child; I even kept a black &amp; white marble notebook about her 'episodes' so that I could present it to the 'men in the white coats' when they came to take her away so they'd have some history to go on. That never happened. Untreated/undiagnosed mental illness takes a huge toll on everyone but mostly on YOU the recipient of all of her wrath suspicions histrionics and runaway thoughts she can't seem to stop ruminating on.  You need a break. Yes it would be great to run away to some tropical island but that's not reality just a nice fantasy. Why not focus on what you can actually DO to get mom out of your living space NOW? Who cares if you send her off to the sibling &amp; they have a fight? Welcome to YOUR LIFE! Look into Assisted Living or Independent Senior Living or just an apartment for her OUT of your house (or you moving out of her house; whatever your living arrangement is). Other alternatives ARE available even if you think they're not. They are. Medicaid is available to finance Skilled Nursing if she qualifies. Section 8 housing is available even if it means you get her on a list now for sometime down the road. Even just getting the ball in motion can relieve your MIND of some of the burden it's hanging onto.   I don't have all the answers I just want to make you think about finding some yourself. Living like this with THIS type of mother invading your peace 24/7 is a terrible burden to bear. It has nothing to do with 'love' but with peace and with blessed silence that you deserve to have in your life. We all do. It's a human right I think that we take for granted until someone steps in and takes it away from us. Then we realize just how sacred it was!

My aunt (95) has had those since the pandemic and they don\u2019t appear to be going away.  She also receives Medicare paid visits from her hospice group.   I agree with Barb call another hospice or home health group.  You will need a doctor though for orders on the home health. Some hospice have their own doctors I thought all of them did?   I wonder about your moms insurance. if they can help? If she has original Medicare you can contact any doctor that accepts Medicare for an appointment. If you are on one of the advantage plans call them and see if they can guide you to a quicker solution.  They may have a nurse on call who can help with some of your questions. My cousin actually had the cell number to her parents doctor. Came in really handy when they both had COVID.   If your mom has several issues going on sometimes the ER visit to a top hospital can get things going. Again check her insurance. That\u2019s who they all work for it seems to me.

There is a process to healthcare in the US. One cannot just \"call up\" and ask for this or that -- this is dangerous for patients wastes resources and is a liability for the medical community since they will be the ones held ultimately responsible for what happens to us or the people for whom we are responsible.   We receive the \"best\" care possible when all the facts are gathered into one file and the medical professional can carefully review them. I'm sure when one is in full burnout that this feels like an eternity and an emergency but this is the process -- please hang in there a little longer. See if you can get her a house call. Even call the doctor's clinic directly and make an appeal.    I'm MPoA for my 2 aunts who live in FL ages 99 and 102. At the last visit to their doctor -- whom they've seen for the past 20 years -- he told me with his own lips to have his staff call him to come to my aunts' home if they needed him but I couldn't get them into the car and it wasn't an ambulance emergency.

{"post_id": "474037", "title": "Medicare keeps taking money from my social security check.", "body": "On 8/28/2017 I was bitten by a neighbor's dog. The bite didn\u2019t require stitches so I went to my doctor on 8/29 to just get it checked out. That was the only visit and treatment I ever received for the dog bite. Since I had Medicare that was who the doctor's office charged for the visit. My daughter had a lawyer on retainer and suggested I file a claim. The lawyer was able to get a judgement for me and retained $235.00 for Medicare. The money sat in the account for several years. I called and asked had it been taken care of and was told after several calls that they would call me when things were settled. Fast forward I start receiving threatening letters from Medicare saying I owe them over $3000.00. With an attachment of over 20 pages of charges they said are related to the dog bite. The charges included knee surgery visits to a Dr. I see monthly and had been seeing since before the dog bite. I call my lawyer and leave a message that it\u2019s been way over 3 years since this happened and he needs to get his behind in gear and take care of this. His reply was a letter saying that he was no longer my attorney and that he took my suggestion as a threat and was going to call the sheriff on me. He still has the $235.00 in addition to the percentage he collected. Then Medicare comes for me telling me that I owe this $3000+ and they are going to be taking 15% of my social security check and charging interest as well. I called TOP Coast Professionals (who make the debt calls) and told them that there was ONLY 1 visit related to the bite. She told me I could send a copy of the billing for the bite and they could get the record adjusted. I got that called to say I was sending it she then said that I would also have to get letters from all the other 70+ service providers saying they hadn\u2019t treated me for the dog bite. I spoke with a gentleman named Ken at another number I called who agreed with me saying that my real financial liability was only $90.00. He was at NGHP. But that I would have to talk to Coast Professionals. He said I should get my money back but he couldn\u2019t say when that might be. I don\u2019t know the motivation of the person making out the report for me that day. They had the ICD codes they knew what was what. But here I sit having sold my jewelry just trying to pay my bills. I don\u2019t have much left to sell my wedding ring and engagement ring are gone. I have a few gold chains left. I\u2019m afraid to pawn my car. I couldn\u2019t pay it back and I\u2019d lose my car too. I don\u2019t know if you can help me but maybe the people who are reading this will be forewarned to just pay the bill don\u2019t wait for Medicare to call one day.

I tried really I tried to get as much culled out before the 'big pack' as I call it but so much stuff really is necessary for a few more years. I'm still baking and so all those supplies need to stay. I still can a few things and all that stuff also. However the thought of canning salsa ever again--meh I think I can do without.   I watched my girls do exactly what I have done to mother umpteen times and felt that I almost owe her an apology--although in her case she hoards papers and magazines and envelopes--true garbage and I have too many 'craft interests' which do benefit people. But I may never do them again.   This move has not been without a lot of drama and a few tears. DH is capable of doing a LOT of home improvement but while he needed to do some smaller jobs he got slammed by work and instead of helping me he was working at his job. So we're way behind on the 'schedule'....  LUCKILY--we sold this house to our nephew and then rented it back from him so technically we don't have to hand over the keys until the 31st. We plan to have everything out by Wednesday.  Our carpet guy mis measured and so we have no carpet in the 2nd most important area--the office. Praying that we can get that done by Tuesday--as DH HAS to work. Probably the entire office will be in the garage and we'll move it in and set it up next week.   None of our appliances can go in until the cabinetry is done and THEY are waiting on the main contractor to tear out a portion of the kitchen island so that also means our granite countertops are still sitting in the warehouse.   I'll do the best I can but b/c of the new sheetrock I can't 'put away' my kitchen as I would have to re-dust every drawer and shelf yet again.   We don't have much furniture really planning to downsize but SIL had some furniture he uses for staging small condos and he gave that to us. So we have like one truckload of furniture and a lot of boxes to move. My middle daughter is coming over after school and she will super organize the boxes so the move can be effective and smooth.   Through all of this I have been very aware of the unrest in the Ukraine and it has certainly put perspective on my little first world problems. We're so incredibly blessed with this new place and I know it's where we belong now and for the rest of our lives. This too shall pass and the memories of the home with our babies will be a joy I hope. I have to say a day didn't go by that I didn't feel like we were 'asses to elbows' in this tiny home. Funny how now we routinely get 'lost' in the new place.   Life is funny--my OD just committed to a 1500 sf addition to her lovely home and my YD just bought a freaking mansion of 7000 sf. So we're all in flux this summer.  I pray my back and hip hold out..I was in so much pain yesterday it was unbearable. Tomorrow will be all directing and bossing people. I don't plan to lift anything over 10 lbs.   Thanks for just listening. This is one of life's most stressful occurrences and I for one am really really feeling it!!

Stories like yours encourage me.

Sometimes I picture if I were suddenly gone and someone ELSE were cleaning out my house to sell it.... they would not realize/discern what items ever mattered to me and what items did not. I think it would all end up in a dumpster. Being able to continuously organize and try to keep it pared down seems much better than having the decision made by someone else after I'm no longer able to.

There's a need for support on a site like this b/c caregivers to elders in general are burned out exhausted and devastated b/c they've devoted their lives to loved ones who basically do not appreciate their effort; who complain &amp; treat them like dirt in return. So we're here to vent; to ask for help ideas tips support and to hear that we're not alone when we feel like we're falling off the edge of the Earth. You're not hearing positive stories b/c there are very FEW positive stories to share. Aside from yours that is.  You on the other hand are in an atypical situation where you're thrilled to be caring for your mom for the past 14 years thrilled to have given up your former life to do so thrilled to be 'relaxing' and to have quit your job given up your freedoms friends girlfriends concerts and all the rest of it in exchange for your caregiving duties. Which is great for YOU and you should be applauded for your devotion to your mother who apparently loves &amp; appreciates all of your efforts.  But that scenario is suited to probably 3% of the planet if that in reality. So to come here to this forum and expect to hear YOUR stories uplifting and 'non-depressing' stories such as the one you're telling is about as likely as a snowstorm in Florida in August truthfully. You don't like people telling you how YOUR story is off-the-wall yet you're here telling us OUR stories are off the wall or depressing? This is OUR reality James and for us it's an UGLY reality whether you agree with it or not. Because caregiving to elders IS a hard &amp; ugly job as you may find out yourself if your mother becomes incontinent &amp; dementia ridden &amp; starts playing with her feces &amp; spreading it all over the walls the bed &amp; the furniture. Then you may decide to come back to AC &amp; seek some of the support you once found to be 'so depressing' huh?  The vast majority of us are not 'relaxing' or 'enjoying' our time watching TV or fiddling around on a computer. I can tell you I DO have a cell phone which rang continuously with calls from my parent's ALF with them telling me of mom's falls all 95 of them. With calls from their doctors and nurses and hospice and EMTs and ambulance companies and specialists and hospitals and rehabs and mortuaries and moving companies for the SEVEN MOVES I've made for them and and AND. Because for most of us that's part of Real Life which you have managed to bow out of for the most part aside from staying home and relaxing and answering calls from your mother which you 'don't mind doing at all'. Which is your prerogative certainly.  But please reserve YOUR judgment for US like you've been telling US to do for YOU.  I don't like Twitter; I find it depressing and rather offensive.

It's the craziest and horrible life as I am not able to live my life yet I have a hard time thinking of my mom living with less.

{"post_id": "472781", "title": "Just want to tell my story to help others.", "body": "Last year in December my husband and I moved my parents to live with us. We had prayed for years as we had seen them declining and falling apart both in health and ability to care for one another that we would be able to serve them this way. I must confess how naive we were. We love them dearly but the last year consisted of 5 hospitalizations 2 stints in rehab and too numerous to count doctors visits (with tests as all the Dr's were new and wanted to do their own testing) and that was just my father....we also have my mom with us who has parkinsons along with other illnesses. Dad was WC bound for the most part but he always believed he was fine and could walk again soon. 10 months of mult days a week PT did not change anything and he still declined.My husband and I quickly saw signs of dementia in both of them. Dad was tested and early stage Alz confirmed. Mom will be tested soon.Both gave up drivers licenses when they came.In Aug dad was diagnosed with biliary duct cancer and b/c of comorbities was not a candidate for any treatment. I was encouraged to bring in hospice early for the support and he did have a VA provided care giver 3 hrs in the morning. He passed away on Christmas day this year at home with the family around him.We now are in a new season of walking my mom through grieving the loss of her husband of 60 years with no real support system near by except my husband and I.I was an ICU nurse for over 20 years and can honestly say this was the hardest year of my life. So much we didn't know going in. I would not have necessarily changed them living with us but maybe we would have moved to where they were? It's so much harder for them to create new support networks than for us.I definitely should have picked a gerontologist instead of trying to mimic what they had in TX. By the time my dad passed he had 12 doctors! I never thought through how different our dietary preferences would be and become such an issue or prepare for setting boundaries. Obviously had not spent enough time with them to know where they were each were truly at.I never considered how difficult creating a social and support system would be for them (or the effects on my own as most of my time was at home) I had planned on returning to work in January after they came in December. NAIVE!! I actually returned to work part time in May.My husband and I consistently have to work to stay on the same team and make time for one another. This challenges us as we do not have children and had nothing but time together prior. These are not complaints but observations. We are grateful that the Lord does not give more than we can handle and his grace is new every day.I would encourage everyone consider spending as much time as you can 24/7 with them. Know who they are. Set realistic boundaries and discuss ahead of time. Definitely use a gerontologist to help you know what care is really necessary for the stage of life.Consider in advance if your marriage can withstand the pressures.That is all for now..thank you for listening.This forum has been a lifeline last year as I realized we were not alone.Thank you all so much!!", "date": "2022-02-01 14:13:11", "user_name": "Rbarbacane", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Care Decisions", "Caregiver Support", "Family Caregiver"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/just-want-to-tell-my-story-to-help-others-472781.htm"},

All of the companies are screened. They have had a lot of success at both ends. It was on the \"Today\" Show.  It's sounds like you and hubby jumped in and did a remarkable job reversing everything. You should both be commended.  You are doing an absolutely fabulous job! Keep in mind years' ago someone once said to me \"You can let people rock your boat but don't let them tip you over in it\". I think you get my message.  You are trying to give I assume (your mother-in-law) dignity and quality of life. You also sound like you have \"order\" in your life. When you are caregiving you have to keep some people at bay. I am organized just like you neat on time people remarked how orderly and \"peaceful\" everything is. Peaceful I repeat. This doesn't happen on it's own. It's by keeping a routine schedule and being a good steward over what you do have (materials things living arrangement etc.)  Don't let other people's \"erratic\" behavior come into your castle. It's takes work it takes declining \"some not all\" invitations and you set the schedule for visitations with your mother-in-law. When they visit \"the troublemakers\" you give them a window for example Mom is at her best in the morning from 10AM-12 Noon. Tell them we have appointment to get to that gets them out the door.  I don't imagine this sibling ever shows up with a box of pastry or flowers and asks you \"do you need anything\"? You have to take control which you certainly have and limit contact with the sibling who will destroy everything you built.  I am the female version of Felix Unger so I have my quirky ways we all do. But I insist on keeping my small place with Mom a place of beauty. And some people seek out to destroy that. Don't be polite about this.    The one's that make the most noise usually do the least and usually get the most attention and resources in the family. Unfortunately oftentimes their situation never improves. We all have a relative or (2) who needs a little help now and then along the way and you pitch in and they get on their feet--a death divorce sickness job loss--life happens. But for other's it can be lifelong with no end or improvement of any kind in sight. I call it the kitten who lost their mittens. They always have a problem. Probably more than what you can provide. More like they need professional help-social worker retraining skills perhaps housing and food voucher. They need to be assessed but you can't do everything.   Stay centered.

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "Hello I am new to caregiving on 24/7 basis.   My mother-in-law is 77.  For 8 years since my father-in-law passed my husband's sibling and adult children have taken advantage of her; stripped her financially destroyed her property stole whatever they could to support their addictions. They left their dogs for her to care for (11?) and the list goes on. Anyway the house was full of rodents roaches a large rat snake (not a pet) holes in the walls and floors falling through.   Mom did not want to leave her husband died here so my husband left his job moved to his mom's removed all the human rats and spent 2 years cleaning the property and getting ready for a new home be put on it for her.   My husband found homes for multiple dogs so now we are down to 4 outside and 2 inside) and the new home was put on the property. Now we are getting ready to remove the remaining debris.  However Mom's personal care got to be too much for hubby alone so I retired from my position - he picked up a local job and now I care for mom 24/7.   When I was working I bought mom all new clothes bedding towels drapes furniture appliances etc...so everything was ready for the new house.   To present....So far it has been pretty easy...I clean and do laundry in the AM. She gets up around noon then the rest of the day belongs to her. Typically every other day begins with giving her a shower doing her hair cleaning her bed and bath rooms cooking breakfast massaging her knees and feet and cleaning up incontinence issues as they occur throughout the day - which occassionally means multiple showers.  Her bedroom is cleaned regularly and her 2 little inside dogs (one is mostly house trained the other one poops and pees wherever she feels like it probably because she is a senior dog) - are cared for; fed and bathed.  Mom has since progressed wonderfully in many ways - health wise. Her skin and face looks fresh the arthritic swelling in her knees (which made wearing pants difficult for her) has significantly gone down and she is now able to move around her new home much easier.   Problem 1: One sibling. Everything is drama and most of the time this sibling needs money. - which mom always tries to give. Last year the child demanded a lot of money for a downpayment on a car...literally bullied her until it was received -- and it is like this most every month. Its always something leaving Mom upset and wanting to give whatever money is \"needed\" to this child.   When we explain there is no money to give the bullying gets worse mom gets stressed and anxious her memory lapses she gets confused angry and frustrated. She talks about selling everything going to a nursing home or just dying. It literally takes a couple of days to calm her down.   This sibling hasn't been over for 2 weeks now..mom is starting to flourish though she still calls this sibling everyday.   Problem 2. I will have start working again soon. I am applying for work-from-home positions. Though finding something legit is proving difficult.  So coping: I think I am doing okay.  I do feel a little isolated at times not too bad..Financially we are stressed.

I found in the 20 months she lived with me I was not a Caregiver. The unpredictability of the disease was one thing. I like organization and at 65 hard to change that. And doing the intimate things for her bothered me. I was going to place her a week in an AL to go to a nieces wedding. Turned out they were having a half price sale on room and board so I jumped on it. Eventually it was LTC. By that time her care went beyond what I was physically capable of doing. Yes there maybe some things I could maybe feel guilty about but I refuse to. Because good or bad I was the one that was there for her.   So if you feel you can't do it don't.

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "My 91 year old father moved in with my husband and I a little over two months ago. He fell at home (he lives 10 minutes away - we've always been a close family) and fractured his pelvis spent a few weeks in rehab. Our house is a two family and my sister lives upstairs (it's not a big two family - 2 beds downstairs and one up a bathroom on each floor). The facility specifically told us that my father could no longer live by himself. My sister works full-time and is single so she cannot care for him during the day. I've been working part-time off and on for years family has always been a priority so caregiving fell on my shoulders. Just seemed to make sense to move Dad into our house so he wouldn't be alone and I could still take care of the pets and everything else. We rented a van and moved our college aged daughter into my old bedroom at his house (she's away at school) and my father took her room at our house. My sister moved some of her things into his house in her old room and kept some of her things in her apartment upstairs (my father was very worried that someone would break into his house and didn't want it sitting empty - we figured one less thing for him to worry about). Basically everyone's life was uprooted. The first couple of weeks my father was literally awake all the time. The rehab facility changed his medication and added some new drugs that really did not agree with him. His doctor prescribed additional medication to help him sleep - it woke him up and made him more confused. It took a while to get his medications straightened out but we did. Showering was an issue - thankfully my husband volunteered for the job. Incontinence is an issue. He still gets the urge to use the bathroom but can't make it. So he wears adult diapers. Only problem is that he still thinks he has to run to the bathroom. So he was doing this at night and not putting the diaper back on properly or just not putting it back on at all. So there were many many night time accidents. And like a child he woke us up nightly screaming he was wet (him the bed everything needed to be changed all hours of the night). So I was constantly washing something - my dryer called it quits after two weeks (I completely understood - it was a lot of work).   He has physical and occupational therapy a few times a week at home along with a visiting nurse. The therapy helps a lot but feels like my home has a revolving door - always someone stopping by for something. My dogs are always barking at someone. The therapy has helped him immensely. My father is walking much better with a cane and has learned how to properly use the bathroom and potty chair in his room. The occupational therapist worked with him and he no longer wets the bed at night the way he was when he first moved in. Biggest problem right now is his constant craving for attention and severe memory loss. If he wakes up at 3 in the morning he thinks we're all ignoring him (we're sleeping). I keep reminding myself that it's all new for all of us him included. It's not easy and I don't know what the future holds.Some days are good and some days are tough.

To me its not so much \"misinformation\" as being \"misinformed\".   I will use Hospice as an example. How many times on this forum do we hear that Hospice killed a LO. That they would not let them eat gave them too much morphine. The problem I see here is that this person is either not involved in the constant care or Hospice is not giving family informed info. We all know feeding is stopped because the body is shutting down and feeding does more harm than good. I think its hard for some to get their head around that Hospice means the end. So they are looking for any excuse to why the LO died. They died because whatever health problem they had caused their death. If not today someday.  Now I am not saying there are not poorly run Hospice and and care facilities. You need to be an Advocate for your LO. Ask questions and question. You have a right to fire a Hospice and transfer to another care facility. My Mom was in LTC. I have recommended this place. Another person says they had a bad experience with the place.   Misinformation when it comes to what is going on in the world no one really knows what is right or wrong.

{"post_id": "472935", "title": "Where does the fear mongering stem from on this forum?", "body": "Ah Sigh.  It seems now we get down to one of the real issues you would want to write about. I am so glad you returned to write us a \"for instance\".  I don't think it is fear mongering to say what a difficult thing it is for care facilities to accept clients who are having a difficult time with acting out. It must be recognized by all not just by old nurses like me that a facility that houses many elders in memory care units usually elders as roommates for one another with access to others has a difficult time with elders who are a danger to others physically or emotionally or cause fear for others. When this happens any good facility attempts to work with families and with doctors to come up with medications that will help. And yes therein lies the problem of finding a drug or a drug cocktail that WORKS. That is one that will calm the elder sooth the elder so that they can be more content BUT keeps the elder from going into a zombie-like state where they do not eat do not interact and are in danger of poor balance and falls. \"Zombie-like\" may be an unfortunate choice of wording but I admit to having used it because it does paint a picture. A picture I have unfortunately been witness to. Gives people an idea of what is to be avoided. It is a terrible question what to do in these instances. A question without a good answer in some circumstances despite a whole slough of medications available. It is hit or miss wait and see try and try again for the doctors who aren't there to assess affects and side effects.  This is a RARE circumstance; Most of our elders suffering from dementia don't have these problems. But being on forum for any amount of time we will find out that it does happen is a problem and is one that is difficult to address. Discussing all of this honestly and openly on Forum does no one any harm. It isn't fear mongering; any of us already HAS fear on board when we try to act in the best interests of our elders who cannot act for themselves anymore. Accusations of facilities not caring of their drugging patients into oblivion etc IS/would be harmful. I personally haven't seen that but I could have missed it. It is my feeling that most who work with elders love doing it; it is almost a vocation. The last thing they want is to participate in or witness abuse of an elder. But that's just my own experience as a nurse and as a person whose loved one was in a wonderful ALF. I am glad we came to what is certainly an issue if not THE issue for you. We can better discuss it than when we use nebulous words like \"fear-mongering\".

My parents moved in with me back in 2019; my dad had Parkinson's &amp; mom was worn out from caregiving for him. He was a piece of work; used to being independent and being the boss but with the PD the filter that used to keep him at least nominally interested in other people disappeared. He passed away after a hospitalization in 2020 - probably a PE but a blessing/release in any case.   So now it's just mom living with me. I bought a house for them to move in with me because my condo would not have worked (stairs). Overextended myself on it but it's done. All of their stuff is in the main part of the house; I have my own room/bathroom but just about everything else is hers. My stuff is in the basement as is the rest of hers because when we moved God forbid we got rid of too much. Dishes pots/pans etc. that never get used but have to be unpacked &amp; put on shelves... (\uff0d\u2038\u10da).   I ended up spreading my own furniture out to occupy the space I needed to avoid having her ideas take over the basement too. My dad didn't leave her with much financially and what she had left after their house sold is almost gone because she just buys things we don't need. Retail therapy.   She's had a cough for 4 months now - her dr is treating the symptoms which is about all he can do since the likely reason for it is she eats too much of the wrong things (wheat dairy etc.). I think she has an eating disorder - she used to be quite heavy but had gastric bypass followed by several other complications. She has plenty of energy to shop or cook all over the kitchen but gets exhausted if she has to do anything she doesn't want to do.   I get that some of this is probably backlash from being my dad's caregiver herself for so many years; he wasn't a kind man before PD &amp; she's a retired nurse so there was a lot she did that probably most wouldn't have done. But sure as she feels the least bit neglected she gets \"sick\" which then becomes an actual sickness requiring attention &amp; reassurance.   I have no friends that aren't also now her friends because she's competitive about it - had to go meet my co-workers so now I don't even have that. We go to church when she's up to it - which she hasn't been for weeks because she's self-conscious about the coughing. Yes she has asthma but again cutting out the wheat and dairy help that too - can't cut that out though because that's what she eats: sandwiches with meat and cheese...   I've been working from home for the last almost 2 weeks because we caught whatever bug is floating around; she got dehydrated and dizzy/unsteady. She's better today (drinking more water) &amp; I'm looking forward to going back to the office but then what? She sits at home &amp; waits for me to come home instead of making new friends or contacting the ones she has. I'm not her husband - I'm her daughter....   She won't take care of herself because she knows that I will - sister moved out of the country to not have to deal with this. 2 brothers live in different states - bless them they both have had her stay with them for a week here &amp; there but now mom is not comfortable flying by herself &amp; wants me to go with her. Doesn't get that part of these trips is giving me a break &amp; God forbid anyone should actually say that - she'd go into a funk &amp; throw it up in my face for the rest of her life. NH is not an option at all. Couldn't do it.   She has no hobbies &amp; doesn't want any friends that aren't associated with the church. More &amp; more dependent &amp; enmeshed as the days go by &amp; I'm the bad rotten terrible person who can't say anything because other people do not get it. I love my mom - I really do! - and I was so glad that they moved here instead of being 750 miles away but she's overly dependent &amp; needy &amp; it's getting harder to handle. So one day at a time.

What I do dislike is anger and vitriol against someone who doesn't believe what we believe. I think some few (very RARE) posters are into us doing the \"Social Media Bout\" here on Forum. Or into \"changing hearts and minds\"; I don't like to see a question by some innocent OP turned into 132 answers overnight of a few on Forum who got drawn into arguing with one another trying to prove our own points while the OP disappears under the waves. Realistically I guess this IS social media so I should just \"leave it\" as we say to the dogs. What is it the young kids say today? \"It's all good\"? (I could argue THAT one. I think we are all adults. We're capable of making our own decisions for our own lives of giving our own opinions to OPs who ask for them. Then let the OP sort out what is of value to him or her personally and leave the rest. We have a lot of regulars on Forum. I think we are all good people. I think we would all help one another if we were neighbors.  For the most part I don't think that the admins should intervene. If someone is expressing suicidal ideation they should if someone is threatening others they should make a decision; or if someone is spreading blatant dangerous misinformation (as opposed to opinion) they have to look it over.  So if a post is in some way dangerous in your opinion click on the report button and let the admins decide. I trust them to do so. And do this RARELY; they have a life! As to differences of opinion?? We often don't even agree in our own families; why would be think we can agree on Forum? The OPs I think are for the most part very capable of separating the chaff from the wheat for their own specific cases. And so often we dispense really GOOD information that can make a difference for people. Perhaps sometimes we are baited because folks just love to watch a bar fight and the latest season of Ozark is already gobbled up.  I guess we just have to make our own choice once again. Jump in or leave it. I do agree with cwillie that it would be nice if the admins stepped in when a thread goes South to either move it to discussions or to stop comment. My fear is that because we find out someone doesn't vote for OUR guy (or gal) we will decide their opinion doesn't count; NOT good.

Because the web is full of it literally and figuratively. Does a handful of people really cause you that much fear? Do you not see that it is countered with others opinions?  Personally I want BOTH sides of a narrative with which to make my own personal decisions with. I think we are all okay mostly all reasoning adults and know that our caregiving experience makes us anything but objective on the subject.  I also know that people are going to do whatever they are going to do no matter what anyone here says. Maybe just maybe they will ask better questions and take closer looks at what is happening because of the differing stances.  It is okay to disagree about anything that's what being autonomous is about personal function. It is up to every person on the planet to gather information and use it according to their own particular situation. If we can't do that we are screwed as a people.   I for one don't want or need someone else spoon feeding me what THEY think I need to know. Don't we get enough of that in the media?  I say give us all the viewpoints and personal experiences to help us not get blindsided while dealing with something that is completely foreign to many people when faced with our 1st senior caregiving experience.

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge. And when you overcome a challenge you become a better and healthier person. AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF LIFE!  Good luck to all of you!

It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him. Quite to the contrary the more I loved him the worse he treated me. I was trained by my mother who was very similar to him so my whole life I have been destroyed by jealous people. The more they tortured me the more I needs validation so I threw myself into my work and my hobbies. As a result I became more successful which only made things worse. I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave. I filed for divorce because he is going to keep caregivers refuses to go to Assisted Living until he uses up all his savings. At that point I realize his wife (me) would have to pay his expenses thus using up all my savings leaving me with nothing for when I can no longer care for myself. My kids see only the fake dad the perfect one making me look like the evil person. I have lost them we still see each other but it is very strained. My advice to you go no contact. She will destroy you. You deserve better. You will feel the weight is lifted off of you. Don't feel guilty. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about. Send cards and call. Don't go.

{"post_id": "472662", "title": "Mom passed.", "body": "Hi Friends Thank you for all the support and advice you have given me over the past few years.For those who don't know me my parents moved in with my husband and me in July 2018 when it became clear that my mother had early dementia and was a danger to my Dad who had Parkinson's. Daddy passed in September 2018.It became too much for me to give adequate care to my mom when she stopped sleeping at night in May of this year since I was/am still working full time from home. My brother and SIL offered to take Mom for a \"few weeks\" until I got rested but over the next 6 weeks it became clear that I would not be able to care for her myself. Mom never slept all night after that.Once I figured out (they let me come to the conclusion for myself instead of telling me) I couldn't take care of Mom I started going to see her once a month.My sister who lives locally and I drove out to see Mom on January 6th. When we got there I knelt in front of her and said my name and that I had come to visit her. She repeated my name but it seemed to be a reflex rather than recognition. Mom became more and more restless as the months passed and my SIL seemed to always know what to do to relieve her agitation.Anyway that evening Mom ate 3 bowls of cream of rice but it seemed as if she was in a trance and doing it automatically. That night my SIL had my brother come into the bedroom (not sure exactly why but it was the first time she required his help). Sunday morning her eyes deviated to the left and we thought maybe she had had another stroke (she had a minor stroke in 2013).My SIL called the hospice nurse who said that they were changing Mom's status to \"actively dying.\" My sister and I had Monday off but were supposed to return to work Tuesday. I told my sister she could drive my car home and I'd fly home later but by Monday early afternoon Mom seemed to be doing better so we both went home. My brother called Tuesday and said mom had Cheyne Stokes breathing and the nurse indicated Mom may could pass at any time so my sister and I drove back out (6 hours) Tuesday night.Mom was extremely restless all week. My sister and/or I were with Mom most of the time with my SIL was always available and supportive while deferring to us except for giving Mom meds to make her comfortable but we knew she was doing what she thought was best and since she had taken care of Mom for the past 7-8 months we could point out that Mom seemed uncomfortable but left it to her to decide whether or not to give meds.Friday the hospice nurse said Mom would probably pass that night and she did at about 6 p.m. My brother sister and I were around her and our other sister (who lives in Alaska) was on the phone and got to tell her she loved her and said her good bye.Although I am sad that I was not able to take care of Mom my brother's family felt blessed to be able to care for her and she was able to enjoy time with my brother's family - they have 2 children in their mid 20s who live at home.Mom received the best care possible during her last months of her life and I'm grateful for that and although I miss her terribly I find comfort knowing she's not suffering anymore.My RN sister said \"who would have thought that dementia was a terminal disease.\" Not me for sure.Thank you again for all the support and advice you've given over the last few years.", "date": "2022-01-27 20:45:05", "user_name": "daddysfavorite", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Caregiver Support", "End of Life", "Mom"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/mom-passed-472662.htm"},

There is a whole disagreement among psychologists about what is best for their patients. Many just sit and sit and listen and listen and support and support that \"These feelings are normal\" and \"And how does that FEEL\" and on and on endlessly. What the person seeking help has then is one more friend to listen to the litany. When we are troubled and get ourselves in habitual ways of reacting we follow the same endless paths that lead us nowhere. We count on these listening posts to reassure us that we are \"good\" and \"oh poor you\" and so on. Wonderful but doesn't really help us. We KNOW that but we keep doing it because it is \"comfortable\" and represents \"the known\". It gives a momentary relief. Stress on the momentary. Then there are the psychologists who tell you going in \"This is a partnership; you won't find me to be a silent partner who listens to repeats of the same tale over and over again; I WILL give you input in order to shake you up to rattle the thinking\".  That is the help I find useful. Where you leave the session feeling like you are a neat scrabble board with known words that just got thrown up in the air. A mess to sort through. To think about. To reconsider. Sure we need a friend to support us. Hopefully more than one. We don't always want or need input. And we should SAY so if that's what we are looking for. We see many OPs come and say \"I don't have a question. I just need to vent. I need to let off steam.\" That's great. But it doesn't bring solutions from habitual ways of doing things. We get to let off the steam just great but it starts rebuilding at once.  I am one who likes to shake it up a bit. When people come to Forum they come for help. Some of us will try to help by supporting and listening. So of us will try to help by shaking it up a bit so new thinking can get in. I am that latter one. I think you may be the former. The OPs come for help. They may not always be \"comfortable \" or even \"comforted\" by what they hear but they are free to leave the luggage lie and pick up the briefcases that work for them.

People that are put under their care have been diagnosed by their doctor as having 6 months or less to live and have opted out of traditional care for comfort care instead.  My husband was under hospice care in our home for the last 22 months of his life and while there were times when I had to get after them to make sure my husband was receiving the care he needed and deserved there was never a time when I thought that they were killing him.  Your father was obviously very ill and since you are a Christian you know that when God calls us Home that we will go Home regardless of the circumstances and whether or not we're under hospice care or not. So while I'm guessing that your grief is still very fresh I hope and pray that you will rest in the knowledge that your father is now in the arms of Jesus.

Father in Law moved in with us because we took H\u2019s mother in when diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. FIL never moved out. He was narcissistic. I did his laundry cooked his meals and he NEVER said thank you. It was expected. He completely invaded privacy. Talked about himself every night at dinner. Did no house chores just brought in the mail and went through it all. My H ( now ex) would spend so much time after dinner talking with him about this and that. I was no longer a priority in my relationship. When his father did inappropriate things like ask me to pretend to be his wife or peek in on me through bedroom window from outside back lanai or make very inappropriate comments or walk around with a pair of my panties  my H always had an excuse for his father. Oh he\u2019s just joking. You know he is awkward. I was so devalued and disrespected. I also resented that I had to buy all this mans groceries clothes dry cleaning when he had the financial means to do so. I was financially used. And I do blame my ex H for allowing this. I always wanted to be so kind but in the 4 years this man hijacked my life H  I left. I also started seeing a therapist in the last year which was so very helpful. I learned about narcissistic traits and behaviors. My H did not have the capacity to address his father. He was always the golden boy. His dad was so abusive to his mother when she was living including hitting her. In the earlier years of the old man living with us I thought it was me that just wasn\u2019t patient enough. I cried so much and had NO understanding from my H. Fast forward 4 years. I finally moved out. It wasn\u2019t solely because of fil I had a narcissistic H as well. He valued his dads money well interestingly enough as soon as I move out he puts his dad in assisted living. Anyway we did try to reconcile but I can\u2019t live with a manipulative gaslighting narcissist and all those behaviors really came out strong when his father who he is a chip off the old block moved in with us. It was the beginning of 4 years of hell. Working with a therapist helped me. My gosh you can\u2019t believe there are such scary people out there. So to answer your question yes caregiving did break my relationship but it brought so many things to light. Ultimately I had a narcissistic H who triangulated has dysfunctional family ( enmeshment issues) and always believed I was the problem.

I'm sure you'll get some responses from others in the same boat.

{"post_id": "473429", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "James did you come to Forum because you are a caregiver? Or are you considering becoming a caregiver? Are there any reasons you came to the Forum? Did you have questions you wanted answered and did you post them? This is an elder care Forum. It involves people who for the most part are coming for HELP because they want answers. For instance someone yesterday was new to assuming Trustee and POA duties and had a question. For instance today someone is trying to deal with an in-law with an abandoned truck without a title. For instance someone is considering whether Hospice is appropriate. Whether they can report an incompetent Mom insisting on driving to the DMV. Whether Granny's giving money to grandson's college is \"gifting\". Whether a reverse mortgage is good or bad. For instance someone's Mom has a hacked email account. Someone's DIL feels unappreciated. Someone's Dad is clogging the plumbing. Someone keeps getting bladder infections. So yes absolutely PROBLEMS.  For the most part when things are GOOD you don't hear from that person.  As an RN I used to say: \"realize we are terrified about blood thinners because we see the ones with the side effects; most of the patients are home and doing well with years added to their lives\". If you don't need Forum then please don't stay here; we aren't meant to be a sad-movie-of-the-day for anyone.  I came here about four years ago quite desperate and afraid having been called by a Hospital at the other end of the state about my 82 year old bro in for a serious accident \"and oh by the way incidental finding of probably early Lewy's Dementia.Unless we are looking at stroke. And by the way there's a brain tumor looks old and calcified but still\". I was so afraid.  I was at the beginning of a years long journey to help my bro. To become his Trustee his POA to get his last home sold and help him move to ALF to help him adjust. My beloved brother is gone now and it WAS a journey and we had to get through it together as we had everything else in our lives my Gretel to his Hansel in the dark woods. I can't tell you what these people meant to me in terms of support. At the time I grabbed this Forum like a life preserver and I admit that now several years almost after my brother's death I admit--I am addicted! So James I can only say I am so happy you don't need us now and I hope you never do. And if you take on elder care or become elderly I hope you never have bad days in which you have questions or need support. I truly truly do hope that. But for now make out your POA and Will save up for aging make great friends enjoy life. Our best out to you.  Some here have become a \"close\" community in so far as Social Media goes. But if you head on over to my other favorite Facebook you will find a community that is great fun for you and you don't have to spend any more time on the problems of aging unless you wish to visit here. I do art there nature and animals and gardening and who watches Sister Wives. It's all great fun. My good man I know you are right. There are people out there right now elderly (I am 80 and OK thanks) or caring for elderly which I did as an RN all my career who are absolutely perfectly happy. Go find them and enjoy.

But to answer 'bundleofjoy' I will say this. I am done with friendships and relationships in life. For me every friendship or relationship I was ever in was a scam or based on bad things. From age 14 - 42. I was miserable. And it was all too much hassle and caused too much trouble. And as for work. It got me nowhere. I was an analytical chemist for 20 years in pharmaceutical industry in several companies. I worked on the bench was supervisor manager big and small companies. I enjoyed the work only because it suited my personality. But in reality it was a severe hardship that got me no where. The past 13 years have been the best of my life. I thank God for giving it to me. As far as dreams go all I want to do is relax. I do not even have a smart phone. Never had one. I have a tracfone flip phone I got at Target for 20 dollars and pay $20 every 3 months to keep the account as the minutes never go away accumulated for life. I never use it or have it on ever. I have no one to call and no one who calls me. I am at the highest level of peace I have been in life. That is my dream. To stay relaxed. God provided all this for me.

{"post_id": "473429", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "Ok. I have been taking care of my mom for the past 13 years. At age 70 she was in a devastating car accident that handicapped her for life. Her legs are like glass as she says. She is the strongest woman to go through what she went through. And now at age 83 she can get around a little and cook and plan and generally is pretty good. As for me taking care of her with the house shopping driving her to doctors and all kinds of stuff has improved my life exponentially. I see my main functions as keeping her from depression. Having her be happy. Protecting her from danger in the house. And watching over things. Keep life going for her and me. She would never be able to live here alone in this house. There are so many little things I do everyday that most people take for granted. But put all the little things aside. My mom would fall into deep depression being alone with no one to talk to and interact with. She has been in a rehab nursing facility for many months after the accident and she hated it. It almost killed her after the accident that almost did. She was transfered to a 2nd nursing home to be closer to home and there she begged the therapist there to let her come home saying being there was destroying her. She had yet to even stand up let alone walk yet. She had a fixator on one leg still. But they let me take her home after meeting with them. From there life got better and better for both of us. Took me a while to get my own terrible past out of my system but slowly day by day year by year it went away. Now life is so much better. God works in mysterious way.

Amy Goyer is AARP\u2019s family and caregiving expert. She has written two books on the subject and has her own consulting business. \u201cI am a caregiving expert. How did I end up in bankruptcy?\u201d she says. Ms. Goyer depleted her savings and ended up relying on credit cards after being financially drained by costs related to caring for her parents. After more than a decade of caring for her mom who had a stroke and her dad who\u00a0had Alzheimer\u2019s Ms. Goyer filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019.    Ms. Goyer started a consulting business which gave her more flexibility to care for her parents. She describes the bankruptcy experience as humiliating and embarrassing. But she says it shows how the unexpected costs of daily caregiving can accumulate over time and overwhelm even the most experienced of the\u00a0nation\u2019s 53 million family caregivers. Family caregivers are the backbone of the nation\u2019s long-term care system and provide an estimated $470 billion worth of free care\u2014often\u00a0at great personal cost. On average caregivers spend 26% of their personal income on caregiving expenses according to\u00a0a 2021 AARP study with most personal spending going to housing including home modifications.

Ms. Chatzky and others say family members incorrectly assume\u00a0Medicare will pay\u00a0for long-term care in nursing homes or in-home help only to be surprised when a relative falls ill or needs that kind of care.\u00a0Private long-term-care insurance\u00a0picks up some of those costs but the amount varies depending on the plan. Caregiving is becoming more expensive\u00a0because people are living longer with more complicated medical needs and hiring help costs more. The median annual cost of in-home care rose to $54912 in 2020 an 18.5% increase from 2016 according to Genworth a long-term-care insurance company. The financial strain is widespread. Although the average caregiver is 49 about 23% percent are millennials who have had less time in the workforce to build financial security. Concerns about the toll on family caregivers led to a recently introduced bipartisan Credit for Caring Act that would provide a tax credit of up to $5000 to eligible working caregivers.    Ms. Goyer displays photos of her parents Robert and Patricia Goyer. Ms. Goyer began her caregiving from a distance. Her parents lived in Phoenix. She lived in Alexandria Va. and worked in Washington for the AARP. While her sisters pitched in Ms. Goyer who was single childless and had a background in aging managed their care and ultimately financed a large part of it. At first she would fly to Arizona several times a year but began coming monthly as her parents\u2019 health declined. Her mother Patricia who had a stroke at the age of 63 had frequent hospitalizations and her dad\u2019s cognitive abilities began slipping. In 2009 the doctor said that he had Alzheimer\u2019s and that he should stop driving. \u201cThat is when everything changed. I picked up my life and moved\u201d says Ms. Goyer. Costs start to mount She left her full-time position at AARP and started a consulting business which gave her more flexibility to care for her parents but also meant added costs for things like health insurance. She found a continuing-care community for her parents and moved into their house taking over the mortgage and bills while maintaining her Washington-area apartment to be close to her clients and boyfriend.

I then stayed in touch regularly by phone and 4-5 times a year visits for at least 5 -7 days where I would examine and assess his progress for I kept track of his changes.This process over 40 years led me to learn a lot about family care and professional settings to find resources at my brother's level and try to support locals in helping him. A huge issue centered around his impatience and passive complaining - for which I added teaching coaching responsiveness and found a therapist for him - WHILE also noting that his negative attitude disappeared if we could find the right level of project that he could manage and improve on his own. He blossomed when we stumbled on him using a machine that applied embossed names in gold ink onto to colored leather strips: his unpredictable coordination issues were handled by management of simple repetitive machine.He could not negotiate but as he worked this machine his ability to produce increased. When his paycheck varied from week to week he got depressed and asked his boss the reason and boss explained that pay was based on production and his varied by his moods. This was understandable to my brother but it was when the boss helped him follow his own work by posting his production numbers each day on the wall - my brother began to focus aim to match prior numbers and within a month he beat his own numbers was highest producer.I saw the lesson's potential: sharing his results in repetitive way helped him focus not stay lost in confusion and doubts over his up and down swings. It was exhilarating for him to produce reliably and be paid. His confidence glowed.But the boss left the job next supervisor read records and saw him as a likely problem treated him warily did not see how to help him. After a blowup he was fired.Several different components can impact progress in a complicated natural world and it takes someone alert to progress and trial of various pieces to set up a tweakable plan that adds practical help in enough places to sustain success.

{"post_id": "470787", "title": "Wonderful trick to remotely reset cordless phone of parent who doesn't press OFF button", "body": "Both my aging mother and mother in law have cordless phones and often forget to press the OFF button when ending a phone call. This means that they can no longer be reached by phone the calls immediately go to voice mail. In the past the fix was for me to drive across town to reset their phone. I've now figured out a great solution to the problem that allows their phones to be reset remotely either across town or across the country.I don't know if this will work on all phones but it does work on more than one version of Panasonic cordless phones. To test if it will work on your phone end a phone call without pressing OFF this will put the phone in the unreachable state. Then unplug the base station phone from power and after a few seconds plug it back in again. If this resets all the phone to working order then this solution will work for you.Knowing that the power reset fixes the problem I realized there was a good solution. The solution is to plug the base station power into a smart plug. The smart plug that I had available was one from tp-link while at my mother's house I used her wifi (yes your parent will need to have a wifi connection) to configure the smart plug. I set up a dedicated account that I log into using the Kasa app from my phone and from there it is very easy to turn the smart plug (and the phone plugged into it) off and then back on again. So now when I notice my mother's phone is unreachable I log into the app and and reset her phone while sitting on my sofa at home. The Kasa app login can also be used by my sisters if they notice the problem before me.The app could also be programmed to reset the phone every night when your mother is sleeping (if configured in this way the reset would happen regardless of the state of the phone) so that her phone will be available to callers in the morning.I don't know if anyone else has this problem but both my mother's have the problem so I think it's probably pretty common and the fix is so good that I wanted to share it.", "date": "2021-10-24 18:28:30", "user_name": "JorgeVerde", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Long-distance Caregiving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/wonderful-trick-to-remotely-reset-cordless-phone-of-parent-who-doesnt-press-off-button-470787.htm"},

Before dad died I kept seeing 1:11 and 11:11 on the clock which was the angel signs to me that all was well up above; that dad was getting ready to transition and I wasn't doing anything 'wrong'. It gave me peace to see those angel signs. After he died I immediately started finding pennies (1s) and dimes (10s) that added up to 11s everywhere I went; I saved them all up and have A TON of pennies and dimes in a little bank. Anyway on that note I had a very vivid 'dream' or a visitation from dad one night. He was laughing and holding up a shiny penny in his fingers pushing his hand towards me saying \"Here's your penny for today!\" He was happy and healthy and not sick with a brain tumor as he was in his earthly form. I'll never forget that 'dream' and all it signified to me to this day and that was almost 7 years ago. It brought me great comfort to know that dad was whole and happy again on the other side.  My daughter was quite close with her grandfather too so she also had a 'dream' one night not long after he passed. He was laughing and calling her name which brought her a sense of comfort.

She didn't move but it scared me and I ran out. If I cut out the shape of her head and her hair that's the entity just behind Mom. I'll never know if she was a relative or a guardian angel.

One night while sleeping in her old room/bed I was feeling guilt and regret over how things went in the few months before she passed.

My husband travelled a lot for work and I missed many international trips.  But finding people to dog sit (at the time - he's passed away now) was a challenge where I live so I finally had to decide to kennel him at Petsmart for one trip and regretted it when I came back seeing he had not had proper potty breaks during the 10 days we were gone. Hence my reluctance to travel and leave him. On a different note the same has been true for finding respite workers and caregivers when it comes to my Aunt. I live in a semi rural area in the PNW and I've made multiple attempts to find somebody to come just a for weekend and there is nobody available. This includes going outside of my area and being willing to pay extra. They either don't call back or say they don't come out to where I live or that there is a shortage of caregivers and companions.  Further my Aunt doesn't like it when we leave the house even for a couple of hours which only happens about once every 2 months if that.

Why would she 'like' your visits ? They should upset her actually if you keep telling her about stopping eating &amp; drinking &amp; taking 30 pills a day to keep you alive!   Your mother is suffering from dementia and is having a pity party for herself. As such yes she's ruining your entire mood when you go visit her so you know in advance what to expect from her. What I do when I visit my mother who lives in Memory Care &amp; has advanced dementia is I bring distractions to keep her OFF of the complaining subjects she likes to dwell on. I bring my dog who likes to sit on her lap and I bring my cell phone which is filled with videos and photos of her great-grandson which she likes to look at. Even the ones she's seen before and has forgotten about. I'll even pull up photos on Facebook of her nieces and nephews if I run out of other things to keep her occupied. I also bring snacks which she likes a lot so that's another thing to keep her occupied for a short while.   Find uplifting things to talk about and do rather than depressing things that add to her already funky mood that's my suggestion. It's not easy having dementia and living in Memory Care with other elders suffering from dementia that's a fact! As hard as it is for us to go there to visit them *and it IS HARD I acknowledge that* at least WE get to go back to our own homes when the visit is over with.

I imagine making connections gets harder as we age especially when you add in hearing loss others people's quirks &amp; impairments too.

I literally have to start getting her dressed like an hour beforehand and we only live about ten minutes away from the hospital. She is so resistant to going to the doctor and when the weather outside is bad it's even worse. My only way to deal with it so far is through out-and-out bribery. I tell her that we're going out for a sandwich or pizza or whatever and that we just need to stop at the doctor's along the way so he can talk to her real quick. When that doesn't work I try to explain that the only reason she gets to stay at home with me is because she's being a good girl and going to her doctor's appointments.

Everyone knows I did elder homecare for a very long time both as a job and as family caregiver (I'm still doing that) and I always speak from experience.

Dawn007  I get where you're coming from about gaslighting in the medical profession. It's disgraceful. No family should ever have to make it their life's work to stay on top of everything in the care facility or hospital their loved one is in every moment of the day. Sadly we do have to because that's pretty much the healthcare system for the elderly and family has to do the advocating on behalf of their own. There has never been a nurse social worker or other healthcare professional who has ever gotten away with rolling an eye placating or making a snotty retort to me. When dealing with these people you can't get mad and lose your temper. I never do. I will have straight answers though. Or I will get the bit between my teeth and not let it go until someone loses a job. It's a shame what people have to do just to make sure their elderly are being decently cared for.

Don't read if you care about spoilers.", "body": "polarbear  Feel free to borrow it any and every time you need it. Sometimes I have to add a bit of an explanation with it though. I couldn't tell you how many countless elders I've said this to. That they're not a burden because they need help around the house or with personal care or running errands like shopping or a doctor's appointment.  The \"burden\" is the narcissism. It's the assuming that the family will simply be \"voluntold\" that they are the old-age care plan. It's the expectation that family will simply accept their new life in nanny-slavery with joy in their hearts and smiles on their faces. It's the instigating and trouble making for sport. It's the endless complaining. It's the stubbornness that often crosses over to dangerous absurdity. It's the orneriness over nothing and the \"performances\" (such things as a totally unnecessary trip to the ER because to make sure you miss out on something you've been looking forward to). It's the sense of entitlement like the whole world owes them simply because they were lucky enough to not die young and were able to become elderly. It's the cheapness (even when they have money) and unwillingness to pay the actual price for what things cost. It's overdoing the neediness unnecessarily. Everyone here knows what I mean. So many seniors like children will behave as if they are incapable of the slightest independence and can't do anything for themselves. Not because they actually are but because they want to be catered to and waited upon by acting like helpless infants. Then they resent it when people treat them like helpless infants. When this behavior doesn't achieve the desired outcome they evolve to being a \"senior brat\" and a whole new kind of attention-seeking tantrums start up.  This is what makes our dear elderly loved ones a \"burden\".", "date": "2021-12-13 08:52:41", "user_name": "BurntCaregiver", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/lo-organized-crime-came-on-thursday-night-and-it-had-an-exquisite-sequence-471677.htm"},

Does your SO know how angry this makes you? If not you really need to have a serious discussion about it and what this entire scenario is doing to your mental health. He can tell his parents \"no sorry I'm not willing to give up my few precious days off. You'll have to hire an aide to come in on my SIL's days off\".

The same thing happened one week later and then his Mom informed him that Brother's Wife had told her that he would be available for the day he semi-had off as well. SO chose to confront his mom about this and say he needed his weekends too. Brother's Wife chose to counter by arranging a spontaneous \"Christmas Dinner\" that she tried to get us to come to. SO just said we had prior plans to go out. This dinner btw was in early October and said sister had been here a full month LIVING WITH THEM. Certainly she had enough time during her free Saturdays and Sundays plus all evenings to socialize with this sister but instead chose to disregard that SO has a very difficult less lucrative highly physical job.  He set that boundary. Like his parents he shares almost a phobia about seeing them naked let alone handling private parts.  BW doesn't have to really handle any actual ADLs but the time is coming. It could be here next month if certain treatment is ordered. I would call agencies myself and clarify what respite/advance ADL care is needed but MIL says she doesn't want anyone but DIL and aide in there so I'm respecting that.

If your MIL/FIL were using paid non-family care givers would they expect that whatever agency that was supplying them would give them free care over the weekends?

I have tried to express my feelings to her but have learned it does no good so I just clam up and stop talking to her. Sadly I don't enjoy her company so work at distancing myself from her mentally emotionally and spiritually. It feels like the only way to save myself but fear I may become an empty shell.  As a young girl I was not necesarily close to her - I now am getting a clearer picture of why.  You are not a selfish person. The feelings we have towards our mothers are not comfortable so I think we try to push them down because they make us feel guilty and selfish. I was once told that guilt is resentment turned inward. There may be some truth to that.  Do what you can to be true to yourself. Do what you can to have whatever relationship with your mother that works for you. One of my worries is that when mom is gone I will feel guilty for any unkind ways I treated her.

If you hate this woman this much I would suggest you just keep away from her and not expect any kind of relationship with her. MIL needs peace and support while she deals with multiple health issues. Don't add to the drama by making more. Cancer is no picnic and to have to deal with family issues along with it--not a great thing.   I guess I really don't get what you're trying to say.

My mom has always been miserable angry nasty unself-aware scary ans selfish since my sister and I were born and it's only getting worse. She cares only about herself and is extremely rude manipulative and downright evil. My sister and I are sick and tired of the abuse she puts us through and really want nothing to do with her. All she brings is misery and strife into our lives and she has absolutely no concern about the horrible thing she says to us and other people. She can't go even 1 minute without saying something rude negative or inflammatory and yet she thinks she's the victim. She treats people like garbage then doesn't understand why they don't want to spend time with her. She alienates all the family members and then tries to place the guilt back on everybody else. It's just exhausting and too much drama talking to a 74-year-old who only cares about herself. She said before she never should have had children. Growing up I was scared to death of her she was mean and her punishments were very brutal. Growing up with someone like that has not had a positive impact on my life. My sister and I wish that she would just leave us alone. When she's not talking to one of us she starts hysterically calling the other one and expects that one to be her therapist. Both of her parents lived to be 99 and 98 and were equally as miserable and evil. My sister and I cannot deal with her for 20 more years!! She has already done enough damage to both of us and runs off any new friends she makes. I can't imagine what it's like to have a kind and loving mother who is warm thoughtful and loving.

She has a problem with everyone yet needs to be in the center of attention and typically gets there by being nasty confrontational and provocative. I grew up with her constantly not speaking to me unless I was doing something that made her feel good about herself. As I result I suffered trauma and have anxiety to this day at 53. I have kids of my own and a loving husband. When my Dad died 5 years ago she became even more awful with verbal abuse always seeking attention at others expense. Despite the abuse directed at me I have stood by her due to guilt and it has caused me a lot of angst. Now she is exhibiting signs of dementia she is drinking too much and she is full of hateful speech. I live in complete fear that I am going to end up taking care of her and being exposed to her nastiness on a daily basis. Her words still cut right through me.

As a mother she has dominated every aspect of her children's life.", "body": "I am also guilt ridden about my dad. He has dementia and had health issues and he lived with me for 4 months while i helped to get his health stable. I had to go part time from full time work in order to care for him. It was my intention to keep him with me but he has since had a leg amputation due to a diabetic foot wound. His dementia and his amputation together has made it impossible for me to care for him and run my business and care for my kids. I just can't be everywhere and do everything. My dad has always been a loner (not particularly family oriented) controlling critical and demanding. He went into a rehab facility that is about 20 min away from me after his amputation and I have decided to transition him to the nursing home side of the facility. He now calls and emails me constantly to come and get him out of there. He says he feels anxious when I'm not around and he wants home cooked meals and to stay at my house. At first I jumped at every call because I feel guilty not having him here. But I started to just get more resentful and exhausted and my kids and work had to take a backseat to his needs. I was visiting every weekend and/or bringing him to my house every weekend. But now I don't jump every time he calls and I go about every 2- weeks. I have constant guilt because I know it's not his fault that he has dementia and he feels frustrated to only have one leg. The guilt is always nagging away at me. But I do have to say that my life has simplified somewhat and I know that my dad is safe and well care for where he is. I think you have to think about YOU and your kids and your sanity! You can't continue to futilely try to please or appease her. You can call her now and then send a gift send flowers write her a personal note. But you don't have to have her at your home and be \"tortured\" anymore! That's not your duty or your obligation.

Shortly after she passed my husband took a stroke- vascular dementia- and I am struggling to be the best I can be for him; somedays I just cant take the drooling garbled words and I feel awful saying thing like-\" I missed that try again\" Im trying to maintain his dignity treat him as a respected husband still love him discuss things as husbands and wives do..... Im loosing it.  Sometimes I wonder if the mom issues just knocked the stuffin's out of me and I have less to work with for him like tolerance-the drooling sends me out of my mind. I know better and I cant seem to work past it.   Ok so those are todays issues but for you that are still dealing with mom or dad....please dont wait til their death put an end to this. If you carried what I carried Im suggesting you start now- the healing process- have something left over either for you or whatever else get brought your way.  She used to refer to me as the \"Blood clot that learned to walk and talk\". Or\" the worst miscarriage she ever had-she survived\". All those little terms of hers are silent now but not in my head. Still can hear them still remember when and where she would toss out those phrases.....and on days Im sinking caring for my husband.....here they come again..... Dont wait for the parents to pass-dont let their labels become who you are as I did. Cuz in my situation now granted Im not called a little b**** stupid b**** Gods garbage 24/7 like before yet when I cant seem to help my husband all that is loud and clear.

Aside from unforeseen unavoidable and \"bad luck\" events in some people's lives a main reason why receiving and giving care becomes a burden is because people are in denial and they don't plan and save. There are other factors like the cost of medical care and people who choose unhealthy habits but mostly many people just don't plan early enough.  My mom (the daughter of immigrants) was a single parent the entire time she was raising me (an RN who worked FT). She never received a penny of child support. YET she went on to own her own home (a humble home later in life and paid cash for it) owns her car has no other debt and lives comfortably on her savings. Because of clean living and the luck of the draw she is a very healthy 92-yr old. She has good financial means right now but if she has a profound medical issue she will burn through her savings pretty fast. Most people's life savings are used up in the last 18 months of their lives. At some point if she requires Medicaid so be it. This is what it's for (also funded by taxes).   Creating an adult care tax credit will require management by the government. Our large and inefficient government. Everyone else's taxes will go up to fund yet another program. IMO we should be lobbying for more transparency in medical and care costs so that there is accountability and we can vote with our wallets.

She lived in a very nice senior community (but alas did not have MC/NH).

The aides would show up late &amp; leave early etc &amp; her care became a nightmare . So I just moved mom over here and we will probably sell her house in the senior community.

I was 24 yrs when I came to America. It kills me to see other families planning summer trips there talking about ticket prices etc. I just cannot believe that there's no need for me to go there anymore.

I'm also an empty nester now and feeling every loss very acutely.Even if covid subsides mom is quite frail now and I doubt she can tolerate the plane journey to India and stay in her senior community like old times.Thank you for letting me ramble on and vent....I'm very grateful that mom is safe with me we have our health &amp; home etc..but some days these thoughts are not comforting enough.", "date": "2021-12-13 15:29:30", "user_name": "wearynow", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Mental Health", "Travel"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/i-feel-i-have-lost-so-much-with-moms-dementia-i-miss-my-home-country-471717.htm"},

I have a guy who will rope the moon if I asked and does everything in the world to make me happy.And in some important ways I can\u2019t imagine anyone unluckier than me.I don\u2019t know how I ended up 49yo unable to work earlier because of two autistic kids and then after a good career now unable to work because of two 80 yo parents who decided they\u2019d like to fill the shoes my kids left empty except they\u2019re not my kids and they\u2019re not cute.Between ten specialists for dad and three for mom breaking up their fights nonstop both physical and verbal driving around hunting down an old man who keeps taking off after fights expecting I\u2019ll find him and neither of them understanding a thing doctors tell them so I have to drive them to every appointment and be there for EVERYTHING\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m going to die soon if I continue doing this.Just 2.5 years ago I moved them to me in NV from CA because my dad was on oxygen 24 hours per day and admitted to the hospital constantly due to CHF \u2014 a condition he\u2019d apparently had for ten years except he didn\u2019t understand when he was diagnosed so I didn\u2019t know for ten years until I finally went to a cardiology appointment with him. I visited often enough when I lived 7-8 hours away but only for a few days at a time because it\u2019s draining being around their fighting. I didn\u2019t even realize the depth of how he had deteriorated mentally as well.In one month I sold off their lives and listed their house and moved them closer to me because I KNEW my dad was going to die and if that happened my mom would likely dig in and refuse to move.I got them their new place found every reputable specialist in NV including getting him into the Cleveland Clinic for his neurological issues and began to manage his plethora of fatal health problems and managed their entire lives.And he got better. He got better and didn\u2019t die because Mom and I dedicated everything to getting him better despite the odds and he lived. The better he got the worse he became as a person. At least if he couldn\u2019t breathe well \u2014 he was in bed and quiet.The level of energy these two have to battle it out is unbelievable. Without going into detail I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s bad. And somewhere along the way in the last two decades these two feel they need to tell me every detail of how awful the other one is. In the last two years it\u2019s almost like they tell me just to see if I\u2019ll side with the one doing the tattling. (And in 99% of the case it\u2019s my dad who is completely wrong and beyond reasoning but only he doesn\u2019t see it.)I do more than enough.Every single thing they need I have to find and make happen. I read every one of their mail and every time my dad decides he found a better deal for his insurance or a car loan or a mortgage I\u2019m the one who has to clean it up. Their cell phones act up - call me. Their TVs don\u2019t work - call me. iPads die \u2014 call me. Got a phone call \u2014 tell the caller to call me. Drug store claims some drug isn\u2019t available \u2014 \u201ccall my daughter.\u201d It\u2019s me for everything except grocery shopping.This isn\u2019t a life. They\u2019ve taken my life hostage and my life with my guy and my dogs\u2026.it just happens when I have moments leftover.My heart beats out of my chest and my pulse is so wild you can see it in my neck. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I ended up having two stents put in due to 100% blockage and have been diagnosed with diabetes.Tonight I was just screaming and screaming at my dad after having found him walking the streets going nowhere after they duked it out when I was called to find him \u2014 and felt like something burst in my head and for a couple of hours the eyesight in my right eye had a white flash in it. I\u2019m OK now but can\u2019t catch my breath.I am falling apart and at this rate they will outlive me. I never agreed to give them my whole life.

When I was in my mid-40s their relationship significantly deteriorated and I had to constantly be the referee. It was a horrible position to be in. I swear I still have PTSD from the constant odd phone calls drama falls fights 911 calls. It went on for years. In my case my mom was the aggressor and my dad was beginning cognitive decline. There was also prescription drug abuse and alcohol use (not a good mix for 70 year olds). Anyway I eventually had to place my dad in memory care for his own safety. Mom refused to consider any other option (such as in-home care). It was chaos. I am an only child and there was no one else to step in. I thought my life was over.  I do believe placing my dad in memory care probably caused him to die earlier than he would have. To me the blame is on my mom for that. He died in 2019 after 3 years in the facility. Now I am stuck with her but through some good fortune I was able to get the house sold in 2020 and because of her alcohol relapses she ended up in ER/hospital/skilled nursing/assisted living. Unfortunately the physical &amp; occupational therapists have spent all of 2021 bringing her from wheelchair to rigid walker to rollator and now a cane. Last year at this time she was in a wheelchair in memory care babbling nonsense and now she is walking and wanting to live independently again.  I am not sure me or my marriage will survive another miraculous recovery on her part. I will be 55 in February. I have been stepping in and dealing with their sh*t since 2009.

{"post_id": "473429", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "Here's how the cow chews the cud James: support groups are formed because there's a need for support. There's a need for support on a site like this b/c caregivers to elders in general are burned out exhausted and devastated b/c they've devoted their lives to loved ones who basically do not appreciate their effort; who complain &amp; treat them like dirt in return. So we're here to vent; to ask for help ideas tips support and to hear that we're not alone when we feel like we're falling off the edge of the Earth. You're not hearing positive stories b/c there are very FEW positive stories to share. Aside from yours that is.  You on the other hand are in an atypical situation where you're thrilled to be caring for your mom for the past 14 years thrilled to have given up your former life to do so thrilled to be 'relaxing' and to have quit your job given up your freedoms friends girlfriends concerts and all the rest of it in exchange for your caregiving duties. Which is great for YOU and you should be applauded for your devotion to your mother who apparently loves &amp; appreciates all of your efforts.  But that scenario is suited to probably 3% of the planet if that in reality. So to come here to this forum and expect to hear YOUR stories uplifting and 'non-depressing' stories such as the one you're telling is about as likely as a snowstorm in Florida in August truthfully. You don't like people telling you how YOUR story is off-the-wall yet you're here telling us OUR stories are off the wall or depressing? This is OUR reality James and for us it's an UGLY reality whether you agree with it or not. Because caregiving to elders IS a hard &amp; ugly job as you may find out yourself if your mother becomes incontinent &amp; dementia ridden &amp; starts playing with her feces &amp; spreading it all over the walls the bed &amp; the furniture. Then you may decide to come back to AC &amp; seek some of the support you once found to be 'so depressing' huh?  The vast majority of us are not 'relaxing' or 'enjoying' our time watching TV or fiddling around on a computer. I can tell you I DO have a cell phone which rang continuously with calls from my parent's ALF with them telling me of mom's falls all 95 of them. With calls from their doctors and nurses and hospice and EMTs and ambulance companies and specialists and hospitals and rehabs and mortuaries and moving companies for the SEVEN MOVES I've made for them and and AND. Because for most of us that's part of Real Life which you have managed to bow out of for the most part aside from staying home and relaxing and answering calls from your mother which you 'don't mind doing at all'. Which is your prerogative certainly.  But please reserve YOUR judgment for US like you've been telling US to do for YOU.  I don't like Twitter; I find it depressing and rather offensive. So I deleted my account there.

All the doctors did not want to give me this documentation even when it was obvious my mom could not take care of herself. Then to make it even more difficult to get this documentation there was stupid clause in the trust that stated \u201cincapacity had to be determined by a committee of two doctors and a priest.

As someone who is in a similar circumstance my first thought is to take care of your own health first. Immediately actually. I'm concerned about your eyes. Hire whatever help they need now so you can focus on yourself. Then when you're feeling better you can sit down and make a plan on how to best move forward.   I don't know your situation but things didn't improve for me until I told my siblings that I quit. We started working together as a family after that meltdown. It's amazing what can be accomplished if you have help and support from family. If not hire the help and support.  During a discussion we had with an elder care attorney she told us about someone she had on staff. I can't remember the woman's title but the employee would go into the home and evaluate the loved one and then make recommendations for care. She was like a geriatric social worker.   My husband and I have been held hostage for so many years I'm embarrassed to say because neither of us had the gumption to stand up for ourselves. As a result we've been caregivers for the three parents between us without help from family. Now I say \"Two down one to go.\" Dark humor forgive me.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "I'm a 36 year old only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7 I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills endless phone calls mountains of paperwork and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating.  Add to that I'm really sick of being a caregiver already and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week came home for a week went in for another week and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her and I feel bad about it. I apologized but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same.  I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot. I'm tired of being trapped in this house not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion. I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984 she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so.  The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings at home with me.  So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

Neither you or your mother will win a argument when trying to reason with someone with dementia. His ability to reason is long gone as is the executive ability required to manage his life.

Three patrol cars came and busted down the garage door to get in because they were yelling at each other in the garage because he was trying to drive off again \u2014 and all it did was get him in a 24-hour psych hold and then they told me to pick him up. And it cost $1200 to fix the garage door.  They won\u2019t touch him because of the massive health problems\u2014at least not without significant bloodshed. The only thing they\u2019ll do is throw him in an ambulance to be held at a hospital on a psych hold because he went nuts on the cops \u2014 and then I\u2019m called to take him back home. I tried to get him admitted to the psych ward officially \u2014 and the social worker agreed \u2014 but the doctor said it wasn\u2019t warranted because he\u2019s calm now.  It was literally better if the police hadn\u2019t been called because then I had to bring home an enraged man back to the same house and either leave my mom there with him stay there myself to ensure her safety or bring her to my home.  I suppose I could not have picked him up and left him there. I freely admit: I don\u2019t know how to do something like that to my own father. I didn\u2019t speak to him on the way home or for a week after until he apologized but clearly there were no lessons learned be it from the police or from how I handled it. Could I have ignored him for longer? Sure \u2014 but to what end? So he won\u2019t go to the appointments I worked my butt off to get for him and we miss something and he dies?   This level of care is why we\u2019ve discovered a subdural hematoma; a GIST tumor in his stomach that we had removed; a gall bladder mass that ended up being gall bladder cancer (also removed); a blockage in his carotid artery that now requires a vascular surgeon because an angioplasty was impossible; a mini stroke recently that now requires more neurology visits and that\u2019s in addition to his CHF vascular dementia stage 3 kidney disease COPD and more. It\u2019s really hard for me to treat him normally when he is clearly not \u201cnormal\u201d not that he was ever a \u201cnice guy\u201d before these problems.  I can rationally accept that the advice you\u2019re giving is sound given the circumstances. I\u2019ve advised as much to other people.

Doing everything for them is not a big issue for me though sometimes I find it irritating.   There are two distinct parts I just cannot stand.  (1) It\u2019s the dynamics of their awful angry relationship that affects me. It\u2019s just unbelievable to me that at 80 years of life with death up right ahead knowing one of them may not wake up tomorrow and that would not be surprising \u2014 this is how they want to spend what could be their last day of life. How sad for them\u2026and how pitiful for me to watch it firsthand.  (2) My dad is just mentally unfit. He\u2019s a well-educated MBA man who worked to the high ranks at a US conglomerate before retiring and he\u2019s deteriorated to making no sense and can\u2019t process what he hears be it in English or Korean. Can\u2019t hear that well and what he does hear he can\u2019t process. (They\u2019re concluding its vascular dementia but specifically not Alzheimer\u2019s which has been ruled out.) And everyone can see it EXCEPT HIM. He\u2019ll still actually tell me he knows better or he doesn\u2019t need the likes of me etc. unaware he can\u2019t do anything for himself.  Worse he creates more work for me having to undo these ridiculous scams he falls for \u2014 Cheaper Medicare! Better refinancing rates! Save money with solar! Free HBO! \u2014 and so forth. All the calls and paperwork I have to do for them doesn\u2019t anger me but when he MAKES trouble\u2026 I just get enraged. And he\u2019s not even apologetic; he says \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Call and cancel it and stop acting like you\u2019re doing something extraordinary!\u201d  Everything else meh \u2014 I\u2019ll live.

They need only get dressed and wait for me on the days we have appointments and attend; they don\u2019t need to listen to one thing the doctors say or follow up with a single item \u2014 I do it all. Literally all they have to do is not create chaos and I\u2019m willing to go to the ends of the earth to make their last years easy for them but it\u2019s like they\u2019re hellbent on sending me off first!

My Mom has dementia and requires almost full time care but I have my brother who always helps out and is very cognizant of what my Mom needs. What you are doing is just. too. much. for. one. person. My Aunt is my support person (she lives in Florida) took care of her husband until she had to place him in nursing home. He died from Alz and diabetes. While he was in the NH she went at lunch time to make sure he ate and then at dinner time. She never missed a day. She also went to support groups and learned a lot. She tells me every time I talk with her - Number One: Never feel bad or guilty about losing your patience or temper or what you say or yell. Number Two: You are doing the hardest job in the world. Number Three: You are doing more than what most people would do. Number Four: No one else has ANY idea how hard it is - unless they have done it too. I really know how you feel about taking care of your Mom and not putting her in a nursing home but you really do need to think/consider about prioritizing some of your needs ahead of hers - such as working and having enough to live on and for retirement. I did therapy via zoom (or something like that) with a therapist that is near-by so I could see her in person some day and I highly recommend you do the same. I am really concerned that this is going to destroy you/your life the way it is right now. I really am.

{"post_id": "471281", "title": "Update to financial impacts of disease treatments...", "body": "A lot has happened since I last posted. My husband's. Neurologist started the wheels in motion for him to begin Onpattro I fusions. Working with a case worker from the drug manufacturer and the infusion center where he will receive treatments we found ou that 80% of the treatment costs will becovered by Medicare. Our supplemental insurance will cover the remaining 20%. There was a slight delay in the approval process. Those of you living outside of the U.S. most likely will shake your heads in disbelief but in the United States our health insurance payment system is totally dependent upon codes that insurance companies assign to various procedures and treatments. Hospitals and clinics may also use codes...but they are usually internal to their operations and differ from those of the insurance companies. And then there is the added complication that hospitals clinics and treatment centers may have separate agreements with insurance companies that place them in selective discount tiers that allow them to adjust payment fees for differing institutions. When a doctor writes an order for a treatment they must be sure to specify the appropriate billing code used by whatever insurance company covers the patient. Many people are employed to keep track of all of this. In our case the neurologist correctly identified the appropriate billing code on the initial order. We were told however that a subsequent note that was sent to the infusion center contained a different code. With all the hands that touch the communications it took a while to identify who had seen the first code who had seen the conflicting codes who needed to contact the neurologist to make the correction and then find out where in the process the first information needed to be canceled so the correct code was used. (Yes we definitely need to overhaul our healthcare system.) Husband will receive his first Onpattro infusion today. We also were referred to a cardiologist to determine if husband's heart is involved. We met with cardiologist last week. We found that in Colorado where we live there are not many doctors with experience diagnosing or treating amyloidosis. This cardiologist referred by our primary care physician has some training both from his residency and a short internship with an amyloidosis specialist. Because husband already had the genetic confirmation of the Val30Met gene mutation the cardiologist limited his initial visit to an EKG and vitals. He advised the test that would reveal cardiac amyloid deposition is a PYP scan. A radioactive injection that when exposed to another scan causes amyloid deposits to glow thus confirming presence in the heart. This test is scheduled for early January.  mMeanwhile my husband's symptoms have worsened. His weakness and fatigue keep him chair-bound and napping throughout the day. If he does something like taking out the trash his breathing is labored and he must rest afterward..When he eats he feels full very quickly. He is eating barely half of what he was two months ago And continues to lose weight. In the past two days he has noticed considerable loss of strength in his left leg from his knee to his foot. He fell the day before yesterday after trying to bend forward to pick up something. He was not injured. But he did reveal that this was not the first time he has fallen. (News to me.) The falls the weakness the reduction in eating all tell me that disease is progressing rapidly. The infusion can't come soon enough.  I will share how the infusion goes and how he tolerates the treatment.

I HOPE you are advocating for your mom and minimally treating the pain. At 87 she doesn't deserve to have to suffer. Well actually nobody does.   I didn't require radiation so I can't speak to that.

I moved them here because it was clear they couldn\u2019t manage their care anymore. Be it a sick dad or sick mom I can\u2019t live with the fact that either died without my having done all I could.   Contrary to what I make it sound like in my original post (1) they were not bad parents to me growing up all things considered; and (2) I actually don\u2019t regret moving them here to manage their care. Even doing everything for them is not altogether torture for me in that giving them a few full-time years of my life to ensure a comfortable ending is still worthwhile to me. I\u2019m lucky to be able to do that. I know that.  It\u2019s that they hate each other and live off this drama that kills me. It\u2019s that they have zero qualms about involving me in this drama of theirs letting \u2014 no demanding and forcing \u2014 their daughter witness the ugliness and misery they cause each other at the end of their lives that just\u2026rots me. It\u2019s truly like a black mold that just spreads and I hate it. That is what I feel \u201cparents\u201d shouldn\u2019t do. I hate that my parents do this and I hate that I let it get this close to us.   I have asked and begged to be left out of it. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care that my dad took off again or that they had a blowout fight but I do not want to be involved in that part.

It causes chaos in my own household (because it affects me) and it causes me embarrassment that my parents are living out the end of their lives like this. My sister and I live petrified that I will turn out like this.

I got a recommendation from the SW or CM at the hospital from mum's last admission. I went with Visiting Angels because they had a local office in my parents town and when I called a real live person answered the phone. When I left a VM a real live person the same one multiple times called me back. They have have been great. Yes we got very lucky with an excellent aide who had capacity to take us on as a regular. If this is what you want make this known from the beginning with the agency. We have 3 times per week aide the same one every time for 3 hours a day. She mops the high use areas cleans the bathroom heats the food and makes sandwiches for supper washes the dishes and does the laundry takes out trash and provides them with some outside company and conversation. It is working out very well. She will go buy groceries if needed or pick up take away food too. The cost is less than $30/hr and if your mother has funds it is money well spent. You have to be involved at first. I was in the home when they started I wrote out check lists bought the cleaning supplies and stocked the bathroom and kitchen etc. But once you get a reliable aide with common sense and some experience after a couple of weeks of check lists its smooth sailing. I would Highly recommend them. But do be there when the aides first start coming so you can show them what is expected where things are and give them the low down on the parent - the good the bad and what you really need and expect. So they are not doing things you dont value and you are not always looking over their shoulder. Every day won't be perfect a couple times I found the trash was not taken out or the cat box was not scooped but 90% of the time its been great. We had only one who just came in sat on the sofa and played on her phone while my dad watched TV and talked to himself. (I walked in on this) But she was just a fill in for one day. The regular aides have been great and if/when they can't show the agency calls me direct and they will staff it with someone if at all possible. And as needs increase we can increase the coverage so they can stay in their home as long as possible. And if the aide cancels or quits the agency finds a replacement to staff your needs.

My mom passed last month and the finality of her being gone is a tough adjustment; but I would have continued my sacrifice just to have her here. I don't know if you believe in something higher than yourself but I advise that you pray and turn to the word whenever you are feeling stressed resentful angry etc etc. I also advise trying to seek counseling/therapy to help with coping mechanisms while this journey lasts. I had no counsel in the beginning and I was my only help. I cared for my mom from roughly 18-39 years of age and that story in itself is something made for a movie which I won't divulge right now as I'm trying to be brief. In addition to what most of your supporters have mentioned regarding seeking someone to give u a break every week or so if it's financially possible or applying for Medicaid so she can have home health aides with her during the day while you tend to your needs you must also focus on your health and well being. We are consumed when caring for our loved ones that we tend to neglect ourselves. I have had way too much experience with hospitals rehab facilities etc etc. The healthcare system is broken and changes must be made. If your parent requires 24/7 care and help the countless facilities I have experienced will cause a decline in their health. Thank God for his blessings over my strength and patience as I was there from sun up to sundown once I realized the care given is not present so I was pretty much an unpaid worker whenever she was hospitalized or in a facility. Places lack the number of staff needed to help and nurses are overwhelmed with too many patients and when you witness this for over 2 decades it's heartbreaking and the quality of care is nonexistent.

This has been a very valuable discussion for me as I'm sure for the original poster. My Mom is turning the corner on being 88 and just beginning to exhibit some memory issues and has incontinence issues. She's in excellent health otherwise. I've gotten her health POA and permissions to discuss her care with her GP Medicare etc. She agreed to do this so that I wouldn't have to deal with all that should she get sick. She lives by herself in a house built by her and my Dad. I moved long distance to live near her 6 years ago when my Dad passed away. My husband and I do lots of little things for her and we're happy to do it however she's beginning to let the house fall into disrepair. I had to have a talk with her to let her know that if she wanted to stay in her house she would need to get things fixed. She is financially well off so money is not the issue. I think she gets overwhelmed when there are too many things to take care of so she just ignores some things. I found a handyman to begin repairing and replacing some of the important things like getting one of her door locks replaced because it was broken. She reasons things away like this by saying she lives in a gated community and no one would be able to get in. Ugh! Her front door locks were oxidized and the key would no longer work so those are being replaced too. When I tried recently to get her to have other things fixed she said it was too much too fast. Big argument there so I let it go. I'm going to try again after Thanksgiving. Her memory issues worsened over the summer. It comes and goes. We live in an area where people live here 6 months out of the year (we call them snowbirds). Her friends are returning and she's as happy as a clam. She's been hacked three times and I worry that it's only a matter of time before it happens again and harm is done. (thankfully I caught all three in progress and averted the worst).  Problems with long and\u00a0short-term memory:\u00a0 1. forgetting that's she's already asked the a\u00a0question just\u00a05 minutes later repeats herself. Seems to come and go.\u00a0 2.Often reintroduces me to those I've known for several years. 3.Showed up a day early to pick up friends for dinner another day an hour early.\u00a0 4. Forgets that she's ordered something online or orders an excess of items.  5. Has several piles of mail around the house.  6. Can't keep up with her emails (I have access to that and clean out the spam for her)  7. It's hard for her to make phone calls for\u00a0things that need\u00a0taken care of or fixed. Gets confused as to who's who with vendors. 8. She has items that should have been returned a year ago sitting on her desk.  The list goes on and on. I try hard to help her with all of it but she's resistant and stubborn. The caregiving has barely begun and I'm already frustrated and angry. Thank you all for the advice!

Well since then we tried to get several attorneys everyone seemed like they wanted a $5.000.00 fee because they where not sure wether they could win or not. Then my brother had a serious discussion with me; he said that our mom would not want us to sue anybody. I was very angry with the nurses and doctors that I felt took my moms life to soon. Well the long and short was there was never a law suit because my brother convinced me that they did everything they could even-though some aspects of that I would have to strongly disagree with but I did get some grief counseling with my sister and it helped tremendously. I had a serious problem because my grief had me going to a place where I truly wanted to see some people not living anymore yes I mean the nursing home staff and some of the doctors but I worked through all of that I had to go to some pretty intense therapy sessions before I just had to let that go and just be at peace with the fact that my mom was no longer in pain with that brain tumor. It was called a Gleioblastoma one of the most aggressive tumors that there are. I am however writing a book called \"The Dangers of Hospitals and Nursing Homes\" to make people more aware of thigs like what are they really getting themselves into and stuff like about how they are going to become the \"Enemy Number One\" if they are there most of the time to watch out for their loved ones and exposing what the care in a nursing home is really like. I am doing this post pandemic and I will mention that in the preface of my book. I want it to get into the hands of people that have put their loved on into a nursing home or had to do it because they had no other choice. I am going to sell it send it to talk shows news stations etc... etc... etc... I want everyone to know the kind of crap they will pull if they can get away with it. For example there where Nurses Aids that would literally hide from us when we needed to get their help. There was an inspection from the nursing homes higher ups and they where literally told to avoid the inspectors if the came their way. They told them to go the other way. I got charged for co-pays after my mothers death that they where not suppose to charge after her death. When a person dies they are no longer responsible for any bill that that loved one had there was a guy stealing out of the nursing home patients funds that the family's put in for the patients so they had some money for themselves he invested it in football tickets and sold it to other people at a huge markup. He got arrested and killed himself in jail. I didn't get to take them to court but I am going to expose them to the public so they cant hurt anybody else.", "date": "2021-11-05 01:53:11", "user_name": "trapwhisk", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Elder Abuse", "End of Life", "Grief"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm"},

She was 85 yrs old when she came here to live in a home just 2 doors away from me. She just gave me the power to take over all her finances and keep the orderly running of her home. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. She was up and down in her health and my life became doctor visits taking her out to places she would enjoy and food shopping for her. I lost my own life completely. If the electric went out during a storm I worried. If we had a blizzard and couldn\u2019t get out I worried. Every minute of every day was thinking about her her bills that needed to be paid her medication refills her congestive heart failure problems her growing breast cancer her taking a shower just everything that a person needs in order to live comfortably. She was able to do so because I gave up everything for her. And I did resent her. She would not have done that for me. Now that she is passed - at age 95 (this past summer) I feel relieved but I am still stuck. I urge you to think about a facility that can care for her at her level of care. This is a situation that will eat you alive. I developed Non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 5 yrs into my caretaking and I know it was due to stress the first years of caring for her. I am still treating. I don\u2019t know how long I have as I am stage 3b and there are only 4 stages. My body could not take the stress of actually taking over someone else\u2019s life. I kept a diary of sorts for the first few years and when I read back on it I don\u2019t know how I did it. It was a terrible time for me. My mother had it good but I did not. Please consider doing the next best thing and do not feel guilty. You deserve your life and she will have hers. She may not like it in the beginning but don\u2019t let that sway you. You will be fine and she will even have friends meals showers etc. in her new home. And you can visit her and be her daughter again. Do it.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Might I make a few observations and suggestions.  1 - Your mom's care will be overwhelming if you are the only person caring for her 24/7/365. Burnout is inevitable if you do not get enough \"time off\" to meet your own health needs and social needs.  2 - While I admire your dedication to your mom and her care you are neglecting your own retirement. You need to secure your own financial state first and being with mom second. Nobody can secure your finances or retirement but you.  3 - Everything seems overwhelming. You need to sort out the issues and create a plan. Meeting with a social worker and a counsellor - even televideo meetings can help. The social worker can help you locate and access all the resources available for your situation. A counsellor can help you sort out the emotional overload and create a healthy plan for dealing with your mom.  4 - There are lots of ways that you can work get enough time off and help care for mom. You can not care for her 24/7/365 alone.   a - Ask for help from family friends community of faith and paid help. Some folks will be OK with sitting your mom for a few hours weekly. Others may be able to help with household tasks: housekeeping meals yardwork running errands...  b - if you can not get enough help to care for mom at home then it is time to look at outside resources. Adult Day Care is a Monday through Friday daytime option; they care for mom in a nursing home of private home while you work. Home health aides can also watch mom in your home while you work. Assisted living usually consists of having a private room or suite with home health aides that assist throughout the day. Full care is for those that need frequent care by others. Check to see if mom's insurance and finances will cover any of these services.   c - If mom doesn't have enough finances help her apply for Medicaid. Help her also apply for Medicare and any other public help. You can make an appointment with Social Service. It might help to review their websites and gather all documents needed. If your mom ends up in the hospital again ask social services to help you with these tasks.   d - If mom needs to use Medicaid for help she may be best served in a residential facility that takes Medicaid clients.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Oh goodness. I saw this in my email inbox and I knew that I had to come by and say something. My mom passed away last year. I am 39 years old. And I took care of my mom for 13 years. My mom was 75 much older than your mom but I took care of her from age 25-38. After my dad passed away I was her caregiver.   Listen sweetie. I said the same things as you about how I would never put her in a nursing home and how she didn't want to go anyway.   I miss my mom so much. I burst out crying yesterday because a memory came to me so vividly about her. But there is so much CLARITY now that she is gone. I love her to pieces but she would have been so much better off if at the age of 25 I put her in assistant living. Because at the time she was at least able to walk with a walker and in the beginning I only did things like laundry and cooking and standby assistance for showers. Gradually she got worse took a few falls messed up her back. Became bedridden during the last 6 years of her life.   I was her ONLY caregiver. She did have CNAs coming to bathe her 3 times a week which was helpful but even with that it was a burden. (Ask the doctor to order you this if she has Medicare she should be able to get CNAs to come bathe her). My mom was a fiery woman used to be very independent and always got her way. Very sweet though. She wasn't horrible I'm just saying she was a woman that knew what she wanted. It was... HARD. My brothers off in other states with their family. We had no family here. It was just me. I managed bills her pills her dressing Hoyer Lifts taking her to doctors appointments her dentures her voiding and bowel movements. The whole nine.   I still sometimes here a sound (probably my neighbors) that makes me think its her and I have an urge to jump up and run to see if she needs help. The PTSD-like crap will get to you. I don't even know if it's PTSD. It's something.   Look. I joined a gym and MADE time for myself when I was taking care of my mom. You have to. You HAVE to go on a walk or do yoga. You matter too.   But anyway.... I was saying before... that I have such clarity now. I would have done everything differently. And one thing that I learned... no matter how much your mom says she doesn't want to go to a nursing home the fact is she's just scared. Deep down any sensible human would choose a nursing home over putting burden on someone they love. But she isn't sensible. She's knocking pills out of your hand and she has had strokes. She's sick. So she can't think logically about the matter but you can.   You'd be able to visit your mom in a nursing home even take her out shopping or out to lunch sometimes come by and visit her and tell her about a new guy or job in your life. About your new yoga class. Have photos for her to look at. Grandkids for her to visit with. All these things I wish I could have done with my mom but can't because I never gave myself a life.

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge. And when you overcome a challenge you become a better and healthier person. AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF LIFE!  Good luck to all of you!

I\u2019ve been totally depressed for a day not really understanding why \u2014 until I realized again it\u2019s because I was yelled at all day yesterday by my abusive elderly mother.   I was helping her. It was necessary help.  When I get depressed I sleep (to try to escape). I eat bad food all day. It\u2019s like I self-destruct. I guess the junk food is comforting.  I need to scream.  (I\u2019m very calm friendly when I speak to her).   My mother has been abusive to me my whole life. And like many adult children suddenly we\u2019re helping our abusive parent.  This will go on for years.   It\u2019s destroying my mind (stress). And I can\u2019t work properly because after helping her I have to recover from the abuse.  I know many people are in exactly the same situation as me.  She\u2019ll continue forever.  She treats my brother very well. He does nothing to help. I know it\u2019s a common scenario.

Propaganda like this feeds the mentality that the only solution is to be a caregiver at home no matter what the cost mentally emotionally or physically\u2014and sometimes a combination of these. Doctors did a study and found that caregivers had a 63% higher mortality rate than others given similar variables. Were you ever a caregiver at home? If not you have no idea of what it takes to take care of someone especially with glioblastoma. Where would you have taken her if not a nursing home? You don\u2019t even mention what ways you think were detrimental to her. It doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re providing an alternatives so there\u2019s nothing constructive about this book. It\u2019s already common thinking that nursing homes are bad so why spread a generalization as truth?   At 65 my brother was diagnosed with glioblastoma. He needed 24/7 care. I found an excellent nursing facility on the Medicare website and placed him there along with getting hospice care. He\u2019s been there nine months and they\u2019ve both provided wonderful care. There was an inspection and his case was chosen to be examined. His tumor greatly affected his judgement impulsivity problem solving and his personality. It\u2019s evident that my brother is loved and cared for. Recently it looked like his death was eminent. For people upset because their loved one isn\u2019t being fed hospice explained to us that because his body is starting to shut down so he doesn\u2019t need much food if any. They lose the ability to swallow so feeding runs the risk of inhaling food and causing pneumonia. He\u2019s rallied some but now he\u2019s at the point where his brain says to get up but his legs are weak so he falls. Sometimes he refuses the meds that would calm down this activity. They can\u2019t force him to take them. Fortunately he\u2019s five feet from the nurses station so they can keep a closer eye on him. It\u2019s driving the nurses crazy because they want him to be safe but they can\u2019t restrain him and can\u2019t post an aide there 24/7. Obviously they care and worry about him.   So yes there are bad nursing homes\u2014I removed him from a previous one. But don\u2019t do a blanket smear job. Nursing homes are short on staff.

She moved to assisted living two months ago where she is thriving: eating well making friends sleeping better etc. To get her to willingly pull the trigger we had to allow her to take her car.  A couple of weeks in she approached the administrator shopping list in hand and asked for directions to the grocery store. Since this isn't his first rodeo he redirected her - successfully he thought. She seemed happy with his suggestions (let us call you an Uber we have a shopping trip scheduled Friday and you could go then etc.) and went back upstairs to her room. Then during the 2 pm staff change meeting when nobody was looking out the door she went and she drove away. She didn't have her phone of course.  Eight hours later and well after dark (she hasn't driven after dark in years) the police were just about to put a vulnerable adult alert out on Twitter with photos of her and the car. My husband was on the phone with adult child #2 filling him in (we didn't want him to find out when his friends said hey isn't that your grandma on Twitter?) when her residence called to say she had breezed back in thanks to a Good Samaritan who had guided her back from the grocery store. Where else she had been she can't say.  The next day I \"stole\" her car. It is in the garage in her house which she still owns. She asks after it wonders why I took it why I hate her etc. I've ordered the police report so with any luck seeing it in black and white will convince her it actually happened.", "date": "2021-12-09 09:18:26", "user_name": "Ambrianne", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/are-you-on-the-naughty-list-471582.htm"},

In 40 days in the beautiful new facility they never did anything like this. Here she says everything is nice she became friend of another lady whom she eats with and who encourages my mom to eat more!

As others here have observed and advised you your planned revelations are too dangerous will expose you to legal action and (IMHO) will not alleviate the anger you feel.  2.\u00a0 Your hostility and anger shows\u00a0 and DOMINATES loud and clear.\u00a0\u00a0 Attorneys sense this and can avoid becoming involved with someone hell bent on revenge by setting high retainer costs.\u00a0\u00a0 Attorneys do not need to be counselors and expose themselves or their staff to someone who seems to be vindictive angry and immune to helpful advice.  3.\u00a0\u00a0 You don't understand medical malpractice law and your method of expressing the alleged grievances doesn't fall within legal parameters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only people who are going to read your \"publication\" are those with similar approaches.  4.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter sentence also addresses how you will open yourself to either ignoring your online \"book\" or worse yet to retaliatory action from medical facilities especially if you're foolish enough to identify them.  5.\u00a0 If action in the last sentence occurs you could find yourself facing not only action against your own server access\u00a0but also restraint and cease and desist orders by the named facilities.\u00a0\u00a0 You could also face libel actions.\u00a0 You could be restrained by injunctive relief.\u00a0\u00a0   6.\u00a0\u00a0 You likely would be sued including for defamation.\u00a0\u00a0 The defense attorneys would probably file a motion for summary judgment to restrain you from further action but you would also likely be required to pay the costs of those you identify.\u00a0\u00a0 That means ALL COSTS ranging from time to copy and analyze your complaints have them reviewed by attorneys and/or medical people and the cost of filing a lawsuit with potential cease and desist prayers as well as the cost of serving any injunctive orders against you.  7.\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have several thousand dollars to engage in this hopeless endeavor?\u00a0 If not once the defense prevails judgments and \"cease and desist\" orders could and probably would be issued against you and either carried out through seizure orders or through a lien against your property.\u00a0 How would you handle that?\u00a0 Do you have enough money to pay off a multi-thousand dollar judgment and/or buy a new house?  8.\u00a0 This next comment is NOT intended to be cruel but it needs to be said.\u00a0 Caring for someone ranging from children to ill parents is very challenging emotional and frequently requires personal assessment.\u00a0 None of us want to feel as those we didn't handle these issues well.\u00a0\u00a0 We're often in territory none of us ever expected to be.\u00a0 We're struggling just as you were and are but it needs to be realized that leveling blame and hostility doesn't reverse anything.  Nor does it\u00a0\u00a0alleviate anyone by blaming someone else which is what you plan to do.\u00a0\u00a0 Therapy seems to have helped but not entirely.\u00a0 You NEED to get past this stage if you are to heal at all.\u00a0\u00a0   9.\u00a0\u00a0 Go back to therapy.\u00a0\u00a0 And continue with it until you understand that there are forces existent beyond our control that absolving ourselves of contributory actions and blaming others is NOT the solution.\u00a0\u00a0 Do you really think you're the only one who's experienced this?", "date": "2021-12-25 13:26:08", "user_name": "GardenArtist", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm"},

As a mother she has dominated every aspect of her children's life.", "body": "First rule is protect yourself. You are no good to anyone in this world if she destroys you and your joy.  It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him. Quite to the contrary the more I loved him the worse he treated me. I was trained by my mother who was very similar to him so my whole life I have been destroyed by jealous people. The more they tortured me the more I needs validation so I threw myself into my work and my hobbies. As a result I became more successful which only made things worse. I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave. I filed for divorce because he is going to keep caregivers refuses to go to Assisted Living until he uses up all his savings. At that point I realize his wife (me) would have to pay his expenses thus using up all my savings leaving me with nothing for when I can no longer care for myself. My kids see only the fake dad the perfect one making me look like the evil person. I have lost them we still see each other but it is very strained. My advice to you go no contact. She will destroy you. You deserve better. You will feel the weight is lifted off of you. Don't feel guilty. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about. Send cards and call. Don't go.

It's the craziest and horrible life as I am not able to live my life yet I have a hard time thinking of my mom living with less. Also not being the face of which she says to at first seeing her and asking her how she is \"Better now that I see you!\" Knowing that you are the comfort in their sight.

{"post_id": "472748", "title": "Argumentative, OCD, hoarding, bizarre behavior - could be low serotonin levels (and what helped my mom)", "body": "Thought I would share my experience in case others have the same problem since it helped in my case. TL DR: strange behavior and bad attitude / disagreeableness were 90% caused by low serotonin levels and I was able to greatly improve them.Short background: I had to step up as caregiver for my mom late last year since she could no longer be counted on to take care of herself (ate poorly - not enough good food - craved junk food but still underweight). In trying to help her I noticed some behaviors from her that she had never shown before.Any time I tried to get her to do something there would be an argument. If I told her she needed to do something or I offered a new idea she would disagree before three words left my mouth. She started to horde things (in her bedroom her chair in the living room the kitchen table). She'd get easily distracted while eating - if she saw a plastic bag on the kitchen table she'd pick it up and start futzing with it. It was so bad I had to clear everything off the table and hide things just to get her to eat.Then the bizarre behavior - weird bathroom habits / obsessions walking around without pants / underwear. Insisting that our Senator was on the radio late at night giving recommendations on what to eat (it was a late night talk show host reading commercials). Couldn't be convinced of anything that went against what she thought was true.She went on and on about old things that upset her - when I would address one she'd move on to another thing then another and then circle back to the first item in a never ending loop.She has Alzheimer's but this was a rapid progression from where she was just months before. She mentioned not sleeping so I started researching natural substances to help her sleep. Along the way I saw someone mention low serotonin levels causing problems like she was having. I found a video that listed these symptoms: (don't know if I can post links but the video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_IiJmIL9ss&amp;t=516s)- Frequent feeling of sadness - Constant worrying - Upset when things don't go your way (rigid/inflexible) - Upset when things are out of place - Tend to be oppositional or argumentative - Repetitive negative thoughts - You don't like change - Tend to hold grudges - Trouble shifting attention from subject to subject - Trouble shifting behavior from task to task - Difficulty seeing options - Tendency to hold on their own opinion and not listening to others - Tendency to be locked in a course of action - Needing to have things done in a certain way - Others complain that you worry too much - Tend to say \"no\" without thinking - Tend to predict fearShe had every one of them.I found people suggesting Saint John's Wort to help with low serotonin levels. I found a bottle of liquid SJW drops without a bunch of chemicals and ordered it. Those two days waiting for amazon to deliver took forever. While waiting I cleared it with her doctor to make sure it wouldn't affect her regular medication.I started with one drop in a glass of water. No side effects so I went to 2. Soon It was up to 3 drops in the morning and 2 at night. Along the way all the bad behavior started to slowly improve. She stopped arguing about every little thing. She didn't mind when my sister or I cleaned up the clutter that she didn't want to get rid of just weeks ago. Her actions were more rational her obsessions were greatly reduced. She could eat without without getting distracted by everything (but she still eats too slow - can't change 80 year old habits).Her poor sleep habits still cause problems but as long as I keep the SJW flowing all the symptoms she had are greatly reduced.If you have a LO with similar problems check out serotonin levels. Diet changes can help SJW worked for my mom but make sure to check with their doctor first - SJW can interfere with meds (like heart medications) so you definitely don't want to start it without getting approval.", "date": "2022-01-31 09:59:29", "user_name": "Thought", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Behavior Change", "Medications", "Mental Health"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/argumentative-ocd-hoarding-bizarre-behavior-could-be-low-serotonin-levels-472748.htm"},
{"post_id": "472553", "title": "Do you feel guilty?", "body": "I read many posts where a caregiver feels guilty about what they've done or not done with respect to their LOs` care. The feeling of guilt is often associated with the commission of an illegal act. But many guilt feelings have nothing to do with illegal acts but instead are about what a caregiver did or didn't do in caring for their LO.Whether caring for your parents your spouse or another LO you may feel guilt if - You were a difficult child You mistreated your LO before their diagnosis You wished your LO died You placed your LO in a care facility You wanted time apart from your LO You got angry with LO You feel guilty for what you should have done or what you didn't do. Etc. etc.None of these are illegal \u201cshould have\u201d or \u201cshouldn't have\u201d feelings but they are feelings of guilt nevertheless. Often the feelings of guilt are part of the grieving process. The two can co-exist. But one can grieve w/o guilt. One can also feel guilt outside of the grieving process. Guilt can be overcome and grieving can be more difficult and last longer but can also be worked through. All of the above feelings I mention above don't have to result in guilt.Realizing there is no playbook for dementia care and that you're doing your best can help fight off the guilt trips. Although there are many resources that can help manage the caregiving experience no two experiences are alike so it's mostly a matter of on the job learning. Videos of Teepa Snow books like The 36 Hour Day Surviving Alzheimer's and Learning to speak Alzheimer's can be very helpful but may not apply to your situation. You may have to \u201cfigure it out\u201d. Dr. Peter Rabins coauthor of the 36 Hour Day offers ways to prevent guilt in caring for a LO.

All of the companies are screened. They have had a lot of success at both ends. It was on the \"Today\" Show.  It's sounds like you and hubby jumped in and did a remarkable job reversing everything. You should both be commended.  You are doing an absolutely fabulous job! Keep in mind years' ago someone once said to me \"You can let people rock your boat but don't let them tip you over in it\". I think you get my message.  You are trying to give I assume (your mother-in-law) dignity and quality of life. You also sound like you have \"order\" in your life. When you are caregiving you have to keep some people at bay. I am organized just like you neat on time people remarked how orderly and \"peaceful\" everything is. Peaceful I repeat. This doesn't happen on it's own. It's by keeping a routine schedule and being a good steward over what you do have (materials things living arrangement etc.)  Don't let other people's \"erratic\" behavior come into your castle. It's takes work it takes declining \"some not all\" invitations and you set the schedule for visitations with your mother-in-law. When they visit \"the troublemakers\" you give them a window for example Mom is at her best in the morning from 10AM-12 Noon. Tell them we have appointment to get to that gets them out the door.  I don't imagine this sibling ever shows up with a box of pastry or flowers and asks you \"do you need anything\"? You have to take control which you certainly have and limit contact with the sibling who will destroy everything you built.  I am the female version of Felix Unger so I have my quirky ways we all do. But I insist on keeping my small place with Mom a place of beauty. And some people seek out to destroy that. Don't be polite about this.    The one's that make the most noise usually do the least and usually get the most attention and resources in the family. Unfortunately oftentimes their situation never improves. We all have a relative or (2) who needs a little help now and then along the way and you pitch in and they get on their feet--a death divorce sickness job loss--life happens. But for other's it can be lifelong with no end or improvement of any kind in sight. I call it the kitten who lost their mittens. They always have a problem. Probably more than what you can provide. More like they need professional help-social worker retraining skills perhaps housing and food voucher. They need to be assessed but you can't do everything.   Stay centered.

My mother-in-law is 77.  For 8 years since my father-in-law passed my husband's sibling and adult children have taken advantage of her; stripped her financially destroyed her property stole whatever they could to support their addictions. They left their dogs for her to care for (11?) and the list goes on. Anyway the house was full of rodents roaches a large rat snake (not a pet) holes in the walls and floors falling through.   Mom did not want to leave her husband died here so my husband left his job moved to his mom's removed all the human rats and spent 2 years cleaning the property and getting ready for a new home be put on it for her.   My husband found homes for multiple dogs so now we are down to 4 outside and 2 inside) and the new home was put on the property. Now we are getting ready to remove the remaining debris.  However Mom's personal care got to be too much for hubby alone so I retired from my position - he picked up a local job and now I care for mom 24/7.   When I was working I bought mom all new clothes bedding towels drapes furniture appliances etc...so everything was ready for the new house.   To present....So far it has been pretty easy...I clean and do laundry in the AM. She gets up around noon then the rest of the day belongs to her. Typically every other day begins with giving her a shower doing her hair cleaning her bed and bath rooms cooking breakfast massaging her knees and feet and cleaning up incontinence issues as they occur throughout the day - which occassionally means multiple showers.  Her bedroom is cleaned regularly and her 2 little inside dogs (one is mostly house trained the other one poops and pees wherever she feels like it probably because she is a senior dog) - are cared for; fed and bathed.  Mom has since progressed wonderfully in many ways - health wise. Her skin and face looks fresh the arthritic swelling in her knees (which made wearing pants difficult for her) has significantly gone down and she is now able to move around her new home much easier.   Problem 1: One sibling. Everything is drama and most of the time this sibling needs money. - which mom always tries to give. Last year the child demanded a lot of money for a downpayment on a car...literally bullied her until it was received -- and it is like this most every month. Its always something leaving Mom upset and wanting to give whatever money is \"needed\" to this child.   When we explain there is no money to give the bullying gets worse mom gets stressed and anxious her memory lapses she gets confused angry and frustrated. She talks about selling everything going to a nursing home or just dying. It literally takes a couple of days to calm her down.   This sibling hasn't been over for 2 weeks now..mom is starting to flourish though she still calls this sibling everyday.   Problem 2. I will have start working again soon. I am applying for work-from-home positions. Though finding something legit is proving difficult.  So coping: I think I am doing okay.  I do feel a little isolated at times not too bad..Financially we are stressed.

A couple of days ago my dad caused some emergencies at home. While I was trying to deal with them he kept calling on my mom to help him get clothes and other things he wanted (despite me repeatedly telling him not to). Since she has problems remembering things she couldn't follow through half the time then he'd get upset when he had no right to.   All that stress and everything else going on basically overloaded her - it got her so wound up that the benefits of SJW couldn't keep up. Now I'm trying to bring her back down to earth.  The next day (Actually early AM) she was acting obsessive about a financial matter that had been handled years ago. 3 people couldn't convince her it was handled it took her calling my brother (while at work) who handles that end that she was in fact wrong. And today she was back to obsessing about eating the horrible junk food that makes her worse. It's not happening with every little thing like it was before but she's latching on to some things like she did months ago.   Now I just have to work to get her to stay calm and relaxed and remind my dad repeatedly that I'm the one he should be calling when something needs to be done not my mom.  As far as treating low Serotonin. SJW isn't the only option but it's one of the few I can use with her. Meditation can help but she's not one for that. I tried 10hz meditative music (alpha brainwave frequencies) which helps me relax - but she hates that. Improving diet helps but I struggle just to get her to eat enough to maintain weight. Light therapy can help too but getting her to do it and juggle her and my dad is getting more and more difficult.  Beyond that is heavy duty psych medications but I'd rather avoid the side effects and she hates pills as it is so those are out. So SJW has become the easiest most reliable thing. I just wish it didn't give me a headache when I take it - because I could use it too with all the stress.

I tried giving up mom and saying I will move out and I\u2019m leaving mom to you they didn\u2019t budge and when I attempted to go on vacation for a week I cut my vacation short because my two sisters refused to give up their sleep at night and take care of mom so mom ended up with a UTI for being left on full diaper until the caregiver came home next day. To add insult to injury my older sis who is a doctor said why change diapers at night just leave it\u2026.there r so many things that made me hate my siblings and although I love mom but I can\u2019t wait for the day she transitions so I can leave this family and never look back. I cry so much because I\u2019m so exhausted and feel stuck. I support my mom financially and I take care of everything and my siblings except one won\u2019t even provide 50$ a month to help with mom expense. I have a high paying job but I don\u2019t know for how long I can keep it because I\u2019m not there mentally. I don\u2019t even go out on weekends for lack of caregiver that can come on weekends and my siblings refused to leave their kids on weekend. I will never put my mom in a nursing home.

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "This is not so much a question but more of a rant.In the last couple of years I have found myself fending off requests of assistance to assist with an elderly parent. Requests for money. Requests for time. Requests for care assistance.For the most part I have fended them off. But I do what I am comfortable with and that is all. I am often judged by others for this. Aunts Uncles family friends. But those others do not know what I have been through and were never there to assist me when I needed it. So I don't care. Their opinions are irrelevant. They mean nothing to me and I never have anything to do with them anyways. Aunty or Uncle status means nothing. They are basically strangers. Every source of support in my life has always come from outside of the bloodlines.Now in my 30s I have been the victim of neglect and abuse as a child and have never had any support in my life from my family. Neither emotional nor financial. So why should I drop anything now just because the remaining parent is old and infirm? I am not grateful for what has been done to me. I have always had to do everything for myself and fend for myself.I do feel bad for the remaining parent and I do not want them to suffer. But I also don't want my life dragged down by it and I wont let that happen. I am just going to do as much as I am happy to do and that is all.What tops it off and makes me even more angry is the parent arranged for all inheritance to go the step parent. I know it sounds entitled of me to complain about this but I don't care. After their gross lack as a parent the least they could have done for me is leave some kind of legacy rather than give it all to a step-parent who was part of the abuse and who I utterly despise. Part of that money also includes money left from the parent who I did love who passed a long long time ago and from two sets of grandparents. And they can't even leave me a cent. And yet there still is an expectation for me to be there at the beck and call and drop everything after all of this and they cannot even do that.Children of abusive parents - do not let yourself be pressured by others who know nothing of your circumstances into over -extending yourself to look after them when they are old. Stuff them. If they were never there to help you when you were vulnerable and needed support they are IRRELEVANT.Parents - be careful of how you treat your children because you reap what you sew. And if you abuse your children they will not look after you when you are old.

Well that woman just so happens to be my Husband's biological mom. He moved in with her into the house he grew up in back in 2011. She just couldn't keep up with all the responsibilities of the property and at the time he was single so he was happy to help. Back then he could work a full time job and not worry about his mom being alone all day. Now fast forward 11 years and I am the one providing the care for his mom who cannot be left alone period! I married him he has 4 other siblings who do nothing but criticize and gossip about me when they are together yet they don't help with 87 yearold mom. The x son in law helps more than her own kids except my husband. I'm here with her all day while my husband is at work. And when his siblings practically scared and threatened me into the position claiming I never \"went upstairs to help\" considering that my husband's sister lived upstairs with her and I did go up there but the sister was not mentally stable what so ever and I couldn't be around her she would accuse me of stealing from her and she would get physically violent at times. Plus I did all the house work and made sure all the garbage on the property was up on the road every week and cleaned up the property plus I took care of my 14 yearold son and husband on top of cleaning after his sister and aging mom. So the truth is she financially took advantage of the situation did nothing to benefit anyone in the house made more messes and verbally abused her mom for what? To get a free ticket out of our house and get taken care of by sis telling the sis that my husband and I do nothing for his mom that I never go upstairs when she was the reason why I couldn't sometimes to up there.

Everyone gets frustrated with the situation. Not being able to communicate with that special person the way we use to and would love to do so again. The condition our loved ones are in unfortunately is not going to get any better. It will help to realize that and ACCEPT WHAT YOU CAN NOT CHANGE. Reality is that 'Hope' it will change is a lot of wasted energy and you'll eventually realize it or it will drive up a wall worrying and thinking about it. Once I over came the 'Shock Factor' of what is happening and it is a shock to our systems as we've never delt with it before. It helped me a lot just to realize talking to my wonderful Mother and using REASON AND LOGIC is just not something that's ever going to happen again. Oh sure she has her moments but that's all it is a moment.  I for one will not put my Mother in an assisted living place. Just not going to happen. I'll bring in whatever I need in to allow her to live out her day in her Nest period. When memory goes the only great thing about it to me is whatever drama that arises day to day --- why should I let it bother me? Mother won't remember what happened in 6 hours much less in the morning. Mom's frustration is in the morning is she still has the emotional feelings and doesn't understand why. So I get her in the car and drive around a while just to get her outside her 'CONFORT ZONE' get her outside in the sun. If I leave her inside all day it get to me normal. That ain't good for her or me. So I get her out get an ice cream cone. This afternoon I'm taking her to the Dallas Arboretum. She hates not being able to walk without a stroller. Being pushed in a wheel chair she hates worse but once out she is glad to be out. I found a nice cleaning lady that delt with this same situation with her Mother. I pay her to take all day cleaning and talking to Mom while I go play golf. Mom gets upset when I tell her Lorie is coming today. I know what's coming. ----- I don't want her here today. I totally ignore the statement. I'll even leave the room when she starts talking. Got to go to the bathroom Mom. Come back for 15 minutes with some ice cream and hand it to her. Just FYI I mix little milk with Natural Vanilla Bean Ice Cream soon as she sees it whatever was on her mind goes away. If it doesn't Oh Mom we'll talk about that later enjoy and I'll leave the room. I have to treat Mom like a 6 year old child sometimes. Don't take this wrong but my sanity is much MUCH more important to the overall well being of this situation than is my Mothers as I'm the one dealing with it. Besides she won't remember after ice cream much less tomorrow. --- This is not how is my Mother coping with what is happening to her for that answer is Badly so what's your point. She won't remember tomorrow. My job is to just keep her frustration and stress levels to a minimum nothing else. If I can do that things run fairly smooth 80% of the time.  I've come to grips with the fact that I can't confide in Mom any longer. Can't ask - don't ask advice like I use to. Don't share what's happening in my daily life with her like I use to for she'll go off into outer space and deliver a retort that leaves me laughing. So I don't go there. You should not either.

Your siblings are probably thinking the same thing you are. They can't wait for you to be out of the picture and your mom in a better environment with the help she needs. Your siblings have their own families to think about. Why should they give up every weekend for YOU? You expect them to get on the band wagon on your terms not theirs. That's not a good way to ask for or accept help.  It's time to get your mom the kind of help she needs so she can be more comfortable. It's also time to get your head back into your job and stop blaming your siblings for everything. Not everyone is cut out to be caregivers so don't expect them to be. Being a physician is NOT caregiving.  Best of luck to your mom. What you are doing is not helping your mom. It's holding her back. Please think about this and do what's best for your mom... not you.", "date": "2022-02-17 11:42:03", "user_name": "Flowerhouse1952", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-tired-exhausted-and-just-too-young-to-endure-thisi-need-to-vent-473100.htm"},

The last I remember she was in an ALF but planning to move back home against your better judgment.   I have been using Brene\u2019 Browns latest book as a reference book recently. She discusses human emotions and shares her sources. Under grief she mentions different types of grief that we go through. Some not conventionally recognized as grief. That would be Disenfranchised Grief.  Situations that need grieving where there are no traditional mourning practices.  Also there are three types listed from The Center for Complicated Grief. Acute grief Integrated grief and Complicated grief.   Although the explanation of Complicated Grief from The Center for Complicated Grief is different from this I think all caregivers have a complicated grief.   Being \u201cthe last\u201d and feeling the full weight of that is certainly an occasion for grief. In your case from reading your posts over the years I wonder if you aren\u2019t also suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? You have been through a lot with your parents. We all have been through a lot in our lives and it is so good that you are honoring yourself with searching for support.  Perhaps your next therapist should be one with training in complicated grief work? Whether your mom has passed or not you have been grieving for a long time. Very understandable.   So after writing that about Brene\u2019 Brown I wondered what she would say about trauma. I did a google and came across a great podcast transcript of hers with Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Bruce Perry about their book \u201cWhat Happened To You? Conversations on Trauma Resilience and Healing\u201d. It might be helpful.   One last thing and perhaps not so heavy as my other suggestions is Ancestry.com When I started on ancestry years ago it was only for a few minutes at a time. My mom loved genealogy and I would look up things for her. After awhile I realized that I felt more connected to my family and that I wanted to know more. Reading the census records gave me a feeling of being with those great greats back in the day Sometimes I was shocked to see how long ago they lived as their stories were so relatable. Previous to this my eyes would roll back in my head when the genealogy subject came up. It was like reading the fine print of an insurance policy to me until I felt the connection.

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "LilyBear I can relate to so much of your story! I was also the only D and my parents ended up settling in my city 10 mins away. After my father died my mother slowly started failing but it didn't get bad until she stopped driving at age 90 in 2016. I became her chauffeur and she didn't like it when I placed boundaries about that.   One good thing that I did was to send my 3 brothers an email when I'd been with my mother telling them what I did how she was and how long it took. This was smart on my part since they would otherwise have had no idea how time-consuming she'd become for me.   My 3 brothers are out of state and it took quite a while before they started seeing what I was seeing as she could showtime. Eventually a gall bladder infection landed her in the hospital for 17 days then rehab then LTC in the NH where she finished rehab. Previously to this hospitalization she lived \"independently\" in a condo with the only help being a cleaner once a month (she was fastidiously neat and tidy). She refused to hire help with bathing which she needed. I didn't offer to help and don't know if she would have even allowed it. She sure accepted my help when I stayed with her for 8 long days and nights with some kind of muscle ache a few years prior. She became nearly helpless at that time.   She threatened to cut me out of the trust. She did cut me and one of my brothers out of being POA so that left 2 brothers with joint POA (each could act independently). (One of these brothers took her to the attorney on one of his rare visits -- he later claimed he had no idea what she did at that visit.) At this point she was in the hospital about to transition to rehab. My mental health was being affected and I told the main POA brother that I needed compensation if I was to continue on in my role. He readily agreed and agreed to compensate me with back pay also. (I'd brought up the issue of compensation with my mother previously and she'd gotten indignant and disgusted telling me \"You don't pay family!\")   Just as well that I wasn't POA -- now the POA could pay me $20/hour. (The POA couldn't pay themselves.) No taxes taken out I simply sent my brother an accounting of my hours and he paid from that. My mother would never qualify for Medicaid. Things got better from that point on because I considered it just a job. I had threatened that since I wasn't POA that one of my 2 POA brothers could move her to be near them.   My mother had made it clear (no filters) that I'd always been a disappointment to her was a nasty person was trying to cheat her out of her money etc. She even wrote a disjointed note at the NH to tell one of my brothers (got the name wrong) at the wrong address (was kind of HER brother's address). The staff thought it was quite amusing. I felt humiliated.", "date": "2022-02-02 08:47:41", "user_name": "CTTN55", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/adult-children-abused-by-parents-who-are-now-elderly-467437.htm"},
{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "I wish I had been able to access your letter 20 years ago! In a nutshell both of my parents were toxic. My mother was cold and emotionally distant and my father was a malignant narcissist. When they were still young and healthy they moved near me and my family. My kids were able to develop a relationship with them because they were good to my children. Good grandparents. Poor parents.  It started slowly. They needed help for this or that we didn't think anything of helping them out. I did not sign on to become their main caregiver. I have three other siblings who lived too far away to help. Mom started having real issues along with severe dementia and my father refused to place her. He would take care of her and when I came over once a week I'd spell him. I didn't want to have to bathe her change her poopy pants take her pills or try to appease whatever delusions she had. And he wasn't capable of taking care of her. Eventually he realized she had to be placed it was more than he could handle.   She died and he fell apart. I had to have him hospitalized three times that year and every time he was angry with me. How dare I take him to the emergency room because I thought he was septic? This brilliant man also developed dementia. He started accusing me of stealing his money. I wasn't stealing his money I was paying his bills because he had refused to sign a POA. Was I supposed to let his lights go out? Not have TV? I accessed his bank account with his permission and paid everything online. With his paranoia he told my brother I was doing \"nefarious things\" at the bank and taking his money. So my brother called the bank believing him rather than discussing the situation with me. DCF was called and when I realized what had happened I called my siblings and told them I quit and one of them was going to have to step in.  They were horrified. Take care of him? But he's so mean and difficult! So for the first time the family got together and made a plan to help me take care of him. But they weren't there for the day-to-day abuse. It just kept getting worse. It was my fault he was old. My fault he was fragile. My fault he was blind. He'd go into rages at me often because I wasn't helping him enough with his laptop. Can you imagine trying to teach someone how to work a laptop when they're blind? He couldn't even remember how to turn it on!!  I had promised him I would do everything in my power to allow him to age in place. In the end I realized that wasn't going to work even though we had contracted with two different agencies to make sure we had 24-hour coverage. One of the aides who was caught sleeping made a complaint to DCF. Kind of a CYA kind of incident.   He was difficult until the very end. Convinced I was stealing his money he kept asking for an attorney to cut me out of the will. After the DCF investigation he went to hospice to wait for a bed at the ALF I had selected for him last year.   In hindsight I should have listened to my therapist who advised me to let go of my relationship with my parents and my brother. But I had been trained to be a \"good daughter\".   Yes I'm getting my inheritance. However I'm going to have to use quite a bit of it to get counseling to overcome my PTSD and my bad feelings about myself because I don't mourn either of them.", "date": "2022-02-01 18:53:17", "user_name": "LilyBear", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/adult-children-abused-by-parents-who-are-now-elderly-467437.htm"},

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "My 91 year old father moved in with my husband and I a little over two months ago. He fell at home (he lives 10 minutes away - we've always been a close family) and fractured his pelvis spent a few weeks in rehab. Our house is a two family and my sister lives upstairs (it's not a big two family - 2 beds downstairs and one up a bathroom on each floor). The facility specifically told us that my father could no longer live by himself. My sister works full-time and is single so she cannot care for him during the day. I've been working part-time off and on for years family has always been a priority so caregiving fell on my shoulders. Just seemed to make sense to move Dad into our house so he wouldn't be alone and I could still take care of the pets and everything else. We rented a van and moved our college aged daughter into my old bedroom at his house (she's away at school) and my father took her room at our house. My sister moved some of her things into his house in her old room and kept some of her things in her apartment upstairs (my father was very worried that someone would break into his house and didn't want it sitting empty - we figured one less thing for him to worry about). Basically everyone's life was uprooted. The first couple of weeks my father was literally awake all the time. The rehab facility changed his medication and added some new drugs that really did not agree with him. His doctor prescribed additional medication to help him sleep - it woke him up and made him more confused. It took a while to get his medications straightened out but we did. Showering was an issue - thankfully my husband volunteered for the job. Incontinence is an issue. He still gets the urge to use the bathroom but can't make it. So he wears adult diapers. Only problem is that he still thinks he has to run to the bathroom. So he was doing this at night and not putting the diaper back on properly or just not putting it back on at all. So there were many many night time accidents. And like a child he woke us up nightly screaming he was wet (him the bed everything needed to be changed all hours of the night). So I was constantly washing something - my dryer called it quits after two weeks (I completely understood - it was a lot of work).   He has physical and occupational therapy a few times a week at home along with a visiting nurse. The therapy helps a lot but feels like my home has a revolving door - always someone stopping by for something. My dogs are always barking at someone. The therapy has helped him immensely. My father is walking much better with a cane and has learned how to properly use the bathroom and potty chair in his room. The occupational therapist worked with him and he no longer wets the bed at night the way he was when he first moved in. Biggest problem right now is his constant craving for attention and severe memory loss. If he wakes up at 3 in the morning he thinks we're all ignoring him (we're sleeping). I keep reminding myself that it's all new for all of us him included. It's not easy and I don't know what the future holds.Some days are good and some days are tough.

She is beginning with signs of dementia although she is still pretty self sufficient. She is the most negative person I have ever known. She has alienated my siblings and any friends that she had left.She is critical of everything and everyone. Today first thing this morning I get greeted with how much she hates my cat and wants to get rid of him because she didn\u2019t shut a cabinet door all the way and he pulled out paperwork she had in there. I reminded her that it was my house and my cat and she literally had a tantrum.Although she could do light housework she doesn\u2019t. She sits and watches tv all day. Then when the weekend comes and I\u2019m running around getting things done she says I\u2019m doing it either to make her feel bad or that I\u2019m bipolar (that\u2019s one of the newer accusations). Everything has to be about her. She takes no interest in anything going on in my life.I bought a new trash can for my kitchen and she says I have no idea how to handle my money and I\u2019m too frivolous. I had a few friends over one evening this summer for a bbq and around 9:30 she calls out the window that it\u2019s getting late and they should go home. I was mortified. I\u2019m 46 years old and it\u2019s my home and I feel trapped.She is diabetic and when she gets really mad at me she will eat very little causing her blood sugar to drop very low and I think it\u2019s just to get me to feel sorry for her.I gently suggested a few months ago that maybe we could find her an apartment in a senior building and it went very badly. Apparently I was \u2018throwing her to the curb like trash\u2019.I love my mother but there are times that I feel real hatred toward her. I feel like I do not have my own life.

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "Hi Anonymous1  I was beaten so badly that I have permanent physical scars. My NM claims that it is all in my head and that she has done nothing to be forgiven for. She now 'uses' her age to be extra cruel verbally and emotionally abusive and as an excuse for her behaviour.  I did have care &amp; love shown to me by my great-aunt. When my mother wasn't looking she would feed care for me and love hold me.  My NM does have dementia but can be 'normal' for all doctor community ageing worker visits and so on.  I was always on egg shells trying to please. As an adult I lived with 'the guilt' of being such a \"terrible child\" so that it was my fault that I was beaten abused and humiliated She does her 'act' all the time. She is so good at manipulation and threats that lawyer and doctor are afraid to sign any documentation. I can't get her any other more help without it.  I am expected to be her help. My 'golden-child' sister lives so far away and won't really help me.   I have found out that I am now getting very sick. I think is was the stress I have endured that has actually damaged my heart and body. . Whenever I try to explain to mom that I am too weak or too tired to talk for longer than 30 minutes. then her phone calls and retaliation; get more and more meaner.  She continues to expect me to be at her beckon call even though I have tried to explain that I am sick. Apparently cancer is my fault. It is was and will always be about her.   As children of abusive mothers it is hard to believe that there is real dementia and not just another excuse to abuse us.  I thought I had forgiven my mother many years ago.  Though I can never forget what she did to me and continues to do to me.   I am also a mother who has made many mistakes with my own children now 34 32 30.  Sadly you are so right... you do reap what you sew. I never hit/hurt burnt slashed them called them names belittled them criticized or took away hope or set them up for a fall. I did try to give them better life than I had... but.... it was not enough.   I know that \"you can't give what you don't have\".  I probably did not try hard enough to overcome my upbringing because my boys all have problems; with me and with the world.  After your parent dies you won't get the chance to offer forgiveness. By giving forgiveness you can get forgiveness from others.   I think that abusive narcissists will abandon anyone and everyone (including children siblings 'friends' and parents) if that person is no use to them.  In fact they might walk over and kick a small hungry child--- unless someone is watching.. then they make a HUGE deal out of giving them a dollar.  It is my belief that trying to forgive will at least show you that you have an inner strength that was not pulled out of you and trampled on. Forgiveness is not for the forgiven but for the forgiver.

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "Not sure if this thread is still monitored but in answer to the question one day at a time. My parents moved in with me back in 2019; my dad had Parkinson's &amp; mom was worn out from caregiving for him. He was a piece of work; used to being independent and being the boss but with the PD the filter that used to keep him at least nominally interested in other people disappeared. He passed away after a hospitalization in 2020 - probably a PE but a blessing/release in any case.   So now it's just mom living with me. I bought a house for them to move in with me because my condo would not have worked (stairs). Overextended myself on it but it's done. All of their stuff is in the main part of the house; I have my own room/bathroom but just about everything else is hers. My stuff is in the basement as is the rest of hers because when we moved God forbid we got rid of too much. Dishes pots/pans etc. that never get used but have to be unpacked &amp; put on shelves... (\uff0d\u2038\u10da).   I ended up spreading my own furniture out to occupy the space I needed to avoid having her ideas take over the basement too. My dad didn't leave her with much financially and what she had left after their house sold is almost gone because she just buys things we don't need. Retail therapy.   She's had a cough for 4 months now - her dr is treating the symptoms which is about all he can do since the likely reason for it is she eats too much of the wrong things (wheat dairy etc.). I think she has an eating disorder - she used to be quite heavy but had gastric bypass followed by several other complications. She has plenty of energy to shop or cook all over the kitchen but gets exhausted if she has to do anything she doesn't want to do.   I get that some of this is probably backlash from being my dad's caregiver herself for so many years; he wasn't a kind man before PD &amp; she's a retired nurse so there was a lot she did that probably most wouldn't have done. But sure as she feels the least bit neglected she gets \"sick\" which then becomes an actual sickness requiring attention &amp; reassurance.   I have no friends that aren't also now her friends because she's competitive about it - had to go meet my co-workers so now I don't even have that. We go to church when she's up to it - which she hasn't been for weeks because she's self-conscious about the coughing. Yes she has asthma but again cutting out the wheat and dairy help that too - can't cut that out though because that's what she eats: sandwiches with meat and cheese...   I've been working from home for the last almost 2 weeks because we caught whatever bug is floating around; she got dehydrated and dizzy/unsteady. She's better today (drinking more water) &amp; I'm looking forward to going back to the office but then what? She sits at home &amp; waits for me to come home instead of making new friends or contacting the ones she has. I'm not her husband - I'm her daughter....   She won't take care of herself because she knows that I will - sister moved out of the country to not have to deal with this. 2 brothers live in different states - bless them they both have had her stay with them for a week here &amp; there but now mom is not comfortable flying by herself &amp; wants me to go with her. Doesn't get that part of these trips is giving me a break &amp; God forbid anyone should actually say that - she'd go into a funk &amp; throw it up in my face for the rest of her life. NH is not an option at all. Couldn't do it.   She has no hobbies &amp; doesn't want any friends that aren't associated with the church. More &amp; more dependent &amp; enmeshed as the days go by &amp; I'm the bad rotten terrible person who can't say anything because other people do not get it. I love my mom - I really do! - and I was so glad that they moved here instead of being 750 miles away but she's overly dependent &amp; needy &amp; it's getting harder to handle. So one day at a time.

My mother has always been a very negative individual as well which made me decide to NEVER move her in with me decades ago. So when I had to move both parents near me in 2011 after dad had to stop driving I set them up in a senior apartment bldg in Independent Living. I still did a ton FOR them it was just not inside my home; they had their place and my DH &amp; I had ours. Then after dad fell &amp; broke his hip I had to get them both into Assisted Living in 2014; dad passed in 2015 and mom stayed on in the same AL. It was a good thing too b/c she was diagnosed with progressive dementia in 2016. She became even more negative &amp; miserable in general so I was VERY relieved that she was in AL and not living with me. We were able to maintain our relationship intact that way vs. me having a ton of resentment and hating my life in my own home as you are feeling now.  Mom is now 95 and living in Memory Care AL wheelchair bound and incontinent. She has WAY too many issues to live anywhere BUT in managed care so she's where she belongs and very well cared for by the staff and visited by myself &amp; my DH frequently. Her dementia has progressed to the point where she's delusional almost all of the time so she thinks she's living in a hotel and going out to different restaurants and entertainment centers on a daily basis so that keeps her happy thankfully.  You have to figure out how to get your mom into her OWN place now preferably in Assisted Living that also has a continuum of care so she can segue into Memory Care when the time comes. You tell her that you love her very much but that you need your house back it's not working out for EITHER one of you to be living together. Period. She'll rant &amp; rave but in the end you're doing this to save your own sanity. She is manipulative and trying to guilt you into feeling pity for her by eating too little etc and that will only lead to you feeling MORE resentment and having the relationship suffer irreparable damage as well. Save it while you still can that's my suggestion. Let the staff in AL take care of her and deal with her tantrums as well; you can go visit her and spend some quality time together instead of this 24/7 situation going on now. If she accuses you of 'throwing her to the curb like trash' so be it. She'll get over it once she acclimates to AL. If you wind up hating her by keeping her in your home who wins then? Neither one of you. You're better off having her angry NOW than having a horrible relationship for the rest of your lives.  Here is a useful article on dementia called Understanding The Dementia Experience by Jennifer Ghent-Fuller; it's a 33 page booklet which is a free download:  https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/210580  It will help you understand what is going on in HER head nowadays and how you can deal with her in a more useful manner.   Wishing you the best of luck dealing with a difficult situation.

And even though I forgave them I still chose to remain out of their lives as it was just healthier for me to do so.  Both of my parents are dead now and I have no regrets in the way things went down.

Many many of us expect family and siblings to rally around to contribute an equal amount to the care of our elders only to be shocked and gravely disappointed and then angry. That being said no one can be assumed into a caregiving role and your siblings are under no moral or ethical obligation to care for their parents (and morality means their own not yours).   So you need to decide if you can come to having peace in your heart to being the only caregiver.   Next are you able to be the only caregiver? Do you have PoA for one or both of them? If so then you also have the ability to be the only one to make decisions in their (and your) best interests. You do not need to have any input or consensus about their care with your siblings. The caregiving arrangement only works if it works for both the care receiver and giver. If it is onerous to you you must find other solutions before you burnout.   You can choose to keep going along the same path down a road of bitterness or to make changes. If you are not the PoA then this is an issue. If no one is their PoA you must work to convince them to assign this responsibility to someone and the logical person right now is you (if you want to keep managing and providing their care). Please do this before they enter cognitive decline or they may not be legally able to assign a PoA at that point.

Before bed I prepared a pull up diaper and put in TWO additional insert pads in the middle of the pull up for extra absorbency then I helped my mom put them on. I had a large underpad over the bed to protect the bed in case she soaks through the diaper and pads and clothes. And she often did.   I changed her the next morning. I put her on the toilet and washed her very well front and back with soap and warm water using a squirt bottle (for postpartum use). She never developed UTI from being in the same diaper overnight. She did get UTI several times however but those were all because she went #2 in her diaper and I forgot to give her prune juice/pill afterwards to prevent UTI.

I have a guy who will rope the moon if I asked and does everything in the world to make me happy.And in some important ways I can\u2019t imagine anyone unluckier than me.I don\u2019t know how I ended up 49yo unable to work earlier because of two autistic kids and then after a good career now unable to work because of two 80 yo parents who decided they\u2019d like to fill the shoes my kids left empty except they\u2019re not my kids and they\u2019re not cute.Between ten specialists for dad and three for mom breaking up their fights nonstop both physical and verbal driving around hunting down an old man who keeps taking off after fights expecting I\u2019ll find him and neither of them understanding a thing doctors tell them so I have to drive them to every appointment and be there for EVERYTHING\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m going to die soon if I continue doing this.Just 2.5 years ago I moved them to me in NV from CA because my dad was on oxygen 24 hours per day and admitted to the hospital constantly due to CHF \u2014 a condition he\u2019d apparently had for ten years except he didn\u2019t understand when he was diagnosed so I didn\u2019t know for ten years until I finally went to a cardiology appointment with him. I visited often enough when I lived 7-8 hours away but only for a few days at a time because it\u2019s draining being around their fighting. I didn\u2019t even realize the depth of how he had deteriorated mentally as well.In one month I sold off their lives and listed their house and moved them closer to me because I KNEW my dad was going to die and if that happened my mom would likely dig in and refuse to move.I got them their new place found every reputable specialist in NV including getting him into the Cleveland Clinic for his neurological issues and began to manage his plethora of fatal health problems and managed their entire lives.And he got better. He got better and didn\u2019t die because Mom and I dedicated everything to getting him better despite the odds and he lived. The better he got the worse he became as a person. At least if he couldn\u2019t breathe well \u2014 he was in bed and quiet.The level of energy these two have to battle it out is unbelievable. Without going into detail I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s bad. And somewhere along the way in the last two decades these two feel they need to tell me every detail of how awful the other one is. In the last two years it\u2019s almost like they tell me just to see if I\u2019ll side with the one doing the tattling. (And in 99% of the case it\u2019s my dad who is completely wrong and beyond reasoning but only he doesn\u2019t see it.)I do more than enough.Every single thing they need I have to find and make happen. I read every one of their mail and every time my dad decides he found a better deal for his insurance or a car loan or a mortgage I\u2019m the one who has to clean it up. Their cell phones act up - call me. Their TVs don\u2019t work - call me. iPads die \u2014 call me. Got a phone call \u2014 tell the caller to call me. Drug store claims some drug isn\u2019t available \u2014 \u201ccall my daughter.\u201d It\u2019s me for everything except grocery shopping.This isn\u2019t a life. They\u2019ve taken my life hostage and my life with my guy and my dogs\u2026.it just happens when I have moments leftover.My heart beats out of my chest and my pulse is so wild you can see it in my neck. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I ended up having two stents put in due to 100% blockage and have been diagnosed with diabetes.Tonight I was just screaming and screaming at my dad after having found him walking the streets going nowhere after they duked it out when I was called to find him \u2014 and felt like something burst in my head and for a couple of hours the eyesight in my right eye had a white flash in it.

I am blessed that his illness did not fully control his every thought etc. We had some challenges for the eight days I was in the hospital. Coming home on Monday we had a grand homecoming. Wednesday evening he began to decline until his last breath Thursday evening.He was so good to me and others. I was chilled Wednesday night and bless his heart he tried to get me warm by laying blanket upon blanket on me. By the time I got out of all the cover we laughed. I wasn't cold any more. I still have to isolate as I have neutropenia fever. His memorial service is scheduled for Saturday a week.I am trusting my doctors will give me an okay to go. The church will have me by a door that only I will go in and out and the door will remain cracked for me to access fresh air everyone wearing masks (for my protection) and an 8' perimeter will be set up. I can't imagine not going and after 8 days of antibiotics I feel protected.This disease brought us closer to each other. His prayer was for us to leave this world together. I laughed and said \"I will order an elevator and when God sends it down we will both get on and ride.\"While so many family and friends did not understand dementia I am glad so many reading this does.

He married had children but never completely recovered from PTSD yet was a wonderful and charismatic man who felt gratitude for surviving while many of his fellow prisoners did not.

You were the good daughter who took care of her parents. Kudos to you for caring so much for them (I didn't say ABOUT them for a reason).   Now it's time to step away.   They don't LIVE with you so that part is done.   They fight b/c that's the marriage dynamic they have always had and always will. My inlaws battled like they were in a frickin war all the time. MIL hated FIL so much it was palpable. They finally divorced in after 42 years of vitriol &amp; hate.   FIL died 17 years ago but MIL acts like he's still here and she is as angry today as she was the day something 'bad' happened. THAT'S no way to live. And it is NOT the kids' responsibility to make it be OK. Bet your mom will be the same when your dad passes.   I would change my phone number and get a cheap 'burner' type cell phone to use to call them and only give them that number. Then DON'T answer it or call them unless you can handle it.   They're in some kind of NH? Or do they live alone? Either way *you* need to get out of the CG business!! Like yesterday!  If they live in a NH the staff there should be handling a lot of this. If they live independently hire a couple of thick skinned CG's and let them deal with your folks. Trust me an employee is much less invested emotionally and the fighting and such may ramp down around 'strangers'.   Quit chasing your dad down when he 'runs away'. Call the police. Refuse to pick him up. I think your folks are trying to outdo each other for the 'worst life ever' award. (Sorry but that belongs to MY MIL. )  Once you've hired help--cut down any contact with them to a 2 hr window once a week. It will be tough but at this rate you will die long before they do. I assume there are no siblings around? All of this is on you--rather you took it on you. Now give it back.   Another alternative if finances aren't an issue (And I am aware that they usually are) is to split them up into separate living places.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "I'm a 36 year old only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7 I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills endless phone calls mountains of paperwork and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating.  Add to that I'm really sick of being a caregiver already and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week came home for a week went in for another week and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her and I feel bad about it. I apologized but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same.  I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot. I'm tired of being trapped in this house not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion. I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984 she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so.  The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings at home with me.  So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

Also to a certain extent I felt it was on me to be her caregiver because 1) she lived with us and 2) I was the only one of my siblings (at the time) who was retired and would not have to \"choose\" between work and care.  I am also the one in the family that tends to feel guilt over things which I have no control - I think that was the influence of my mother's mom with whom I was very close as a child but hooboy did she ever enjoy laying on the guilt. She was really a professional at it.  To my mom's credit she never ever took advantage of me even knowing I felt all of those things that I listed. She was also not physically difficult to take care of; she didn't have any sort of dementia so mentally she was always my mom. It was the CHF that left her so weak that she needed help with some ADL's; others she was able to handle with no problem.   I don't know honestly how I would have done if the time had come that I had to place her. While taking care of her at home was incredibly hard in an emotional and mental sense I am grateful that her health never got so bad that we had to make a hard choice about placement. I have such sympathy for everyone who has to make that choice even when it's clearly the only option (of bad options) left to them.

Certainly there are many examples of this also there are many cases where the opposite happens. I'd explain it that some people have a greater sense of family responsibility than others and this may be due to any number of factors including (but not exclusively) how they were raised.  Also there is the factor of circumstances and the parents' wishes. My husband and I are currently caring for his mother in our home - she has terminal cancer and is in hospice. As you all know it is very difficult. At the appropriate time I plan to discuss with my three children that I will absolutely be going to assisted living if the time comes that I'm not able to care for myself.

I know you say it\u2019s been a couple of weeks however it looks like you were \u201cintroduced\u201d into caregiving in the advance section!   Some of us caregivers caregiver quiet a while before those issues. You have been thrown into the deep end.   There\u2019s a book called The 36 Hour Day that you may want to read. And this forum here will give you encouragement and at least show you these feelings of anger and resentment are actually normal. Not great yet very common. Also your mothers behavior is very common. Seems like she hates you\u2026but the disease is messing with her mind. She doesn\u2019t know up from down real from fake - most of the time. Yet she does have her good moments and yes cherish those.   What I\u2019m finding out is caregiving is the most thankless job out there. It\u2019s like you volunteered to be someone\u2019s punching bag. Someone who used to love you but for unknown reasons now wants to make you miserable. However the reason for the caregiver is known\u2026it\u2019s the dementia. You know your mother does love you she just can\u2019t tell you/show you they way she used to. Her world is upside down and she doesn\u2019t even know it.  For the long term if there\u2019s any support you can rustle up\u2026a local support group in person online or phone. Forums like this one they will help take the edge off. Educate yourself with online reading about dementia caregiving whenever you can.  For the short term take a deep breath. Remember it\u2019s the disease treating you like crap not your mom. Get some fresh air. Put on some music. Splash some water in your face. Pet your dog/cat\u2026pet the neighbors dog/cat\u2026just one positive thing no matter how small. It won\u2019t seem like enough but do it anyway.

I have so much paperwork\u2026.it seems like I\u2019ve been doing paperwork for 2 yrs now! However if you can get some help it\u2019ll be worth it.  You are only human. You feel angry when not treated right. Who wouldn\u2019t? Don\u2019t beat yourself up for feeling normal. I wish I could make all this go away but no one can. Find ways to get caregiver support. It\u2019ll be your lifeline now that you\u2019re in the deep end. Yeah I\u2019ve told you some things to do\u2026.as if you don\u2019t have enough to do already.

He died in Dec 2020. As I read your situation I had flashbacks of nearly everything you describe. With every flash feeling like a kick in the gut highlighted with the vivid memories of me being so afraid I\u2019d do the wrong thing paralleled with anxiety over how very long I might have to be in our situation with no one to turn to. We didnt qualify for medicaid no matter how much we spent down due to working hard our whole lives and now receiving pensions that place us above the poverty levels in our state. However if I placed him in memory care there would be nothing left with which to pay our bills. So I can truly feel your pain and the worry and fear that you fight over just \u201cliving day to day\u201d. You took a lot of time and effort with your post and I hope you felt even a little relief after doing so. You most likely have a lot ahead of you that could be difficult. You sound like a very strong and able young woman! Your mental abilities to cope will make all the difference in your ability to establish personal boundaries hence find joy as you move forward. Being a caregiver challenges even the strongest of us!! Can I get an amen from fellow posters!!! Sorry I digress!!! Given what you\u2019ve shared you have no reason to feel guilty or in any way like scum. I would tell you from my experience to find a good psychological counselor that can give you feedback on a regular basis like weekly or monthly so you can rid yourself of the negative emotions as you feel them. They are real feelings and you can\u2019t just wish them away but a trained counselor can help you apply logic to figure out which are the draining emotions that aren\u2019t valid but healthy boundaries. I would bet literally everyone on this site has felt the exact same emotions you describe. Its what makes this caregiving so incredibly difficult. If you have insurance they can direct you to counselor\u2019s in your network. If no insurance many churches have counselors on staff. Many are free or ask you to pay whatever you can. The point being there is no shame in fact it is critical for you getting yourself the help you need and do it early on. This is important so you can make decisions that you will NOT regret down the road after mom is gone. There will be so many decisions and with all you have done and are already doing\u2026you have all that it takes to be a great caregiver and decision maker for your mom. Whether that means assisted living or in home nurses or whatever you decide. It does however take a \u201cheaping load\u201d of mental fortitude so find someone to talk with so you can keep your emotional dumpster emptied and then with each day and each decision you will do great!!! Let me add also If you are a spiritual person leaning on your faith will also strengthen you in ways you might not have known before! God bless you on your journey.

As I was aware they also told me she may not fit in due to being higher functioning. Her functionally is more akin to AL but the wandering and hampered memory which foster a certain amount of dependence pose an issue.

Well since then we tried to get several attorneys everyone seemed like they wanted a $5.000.00 fee because they where not sure wether they could win or not. Then my brother had a serious discussion with me; he said that our mom would not want us to sue anybody. I was very angry with the nurses and doctors that I felt took my moms life to soon. Well the long and short was there was never a law suit because my brother convinced me that they did everything they could even-though some aspects of that I would have to strongly disagree with but I did get some grief counseling with my sister and it helped tremendously. I had a serious problem because my grief had me going to a place where I truly wanted to see some people not living anymore yes I mean the nursing home staff and some of the doctors but I worked through all of that I had to go to some pretty intense therapy sessions before I just had to let that go and just be at peace with the fact that my mom was no longer in pain with that brain tumor. It was called a Gleioblastoma one of the most aggressive tumors that there are. I am however writing a book called \"The Dangers of Hospitals and Nursing Homes\" to make people more aware of thigs like what are they really getting themselves into and stuff like about how they are going to become the \"Enemy Number One\" if they are there most of the time to watch out for their loved ones and exposing what the care in a nursing home is really like. I am doing this post pandemic and I will mention that in the preface of my book. I want it to get into the hands of people that have put their loved on into a nursing home or had to do it because they had no other choice. I am going to sell it send it to talk shows news stations etc... etc... etc... I want everyone to know the kind of crap they will pull if they can get away with it. For example there where Nurses Aids that would literally hide from us when we needed to get their help. There was an inspection from the nursing homes higher ups and they where literally told to avoid the inspectors if the came their way. They told them to go the other way. I got charged for co-pays after my mothers death that they where not suppose to charge after her death. When a person dies they are no longer responsible for any bill that that loved one had there was a guy stealing out of the nursing home patients funds that the family's put in for the patients so they had some money for themselves he invested it in football tickets and sold it to other people at a huge markup.

It\u2019s been an interesting shift for everyone. I am thrilled he\u2019s seeing his children in a different light including me. What I know in my heart is that there will be no regrets. It has changed our family life completely but it\u2019s a chapter a moment in time. It\u2019s harder than I ever imagined. Since he has moved here he has had an \u201cincidental\u201d finding after a fall that required surgery. He was diagnose with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. Wow! What an amazing set of circumstances. My dad wont be alone and we will go through his last part of life altogether. Is it easy? No. Are there precious times? Yes. I\u2019ve learned things about myself and my husband that I never knew and things from my dad that I will cherish forever. He\u2019s going to teach us how to die on his terms since he\u2019s chosen to pass on chemo etc. I didn\u2019t know ANY of this when he asked to come to stay. Sometimes life has plans we don\u2019t anticipate.  I know that I said yes to my dad\u2019s request to move in because it felt right. Having a good relationship prior surely factored into my answer but it\u2019s a completely different dynamic when an aging parent moves in. There hasn\u2019t been a handbook.

If we did it out of reciprocal love and care this wouldn't be an issue.  I think many of us do it because we love our parents regardless of what kind of parent they were or are. Which can be the same or two entirely different people.  I agree with JoAnn that an abused child should not be a hands on caregiver. Making sure they are getting the care they need is the only way to not stay triggered all the time especially if they haven't changed. I think it is also a dangerous situation for elder abuse to occur particularly when the parent treats the adult as a child that is under their authority and needs to be submissive.  For me I help because they need(ed) it and I am the only one willing.   If I treated them the way they treated me that's means I am no different than them and have no room to talk or be hurt by their actions. I also believe that vengeance is not mine. I am only answerable for my actions not theirs.  Good boundaries are vital when we decide to help our elder parents or anybody for that matter.

My mother was mentally ill while I was growing up and I suffered greatly at her hands whether she was intentionally abusive or not. My father was pretty much not around b/c he was working to support her me and her mother who lived with us contributing greatly to the enormous chaos in the home. So no my childhood was anything but warm &amp; cozy. But I'm the only child so who else could step up and take over the care and management of my parents if not me?  'Blood ties' have nothing to do with it in my case b/c these are not my biological parents but my adoptive ones.  Personal integrity has a lot to do with who steps up to care for their parents in their old age too regardless of how they were or were not raised I believe. We have to overlook many things in order to do what's necessary for them as they age get sick need help medical attention doctors living arrangements etc. etc.   So again at the root of 'why' is Love in my opinion. Nothing else really matters at the end of the day. If I love you I will do whatever I have to do to make sure you are properly cared for safe and as happy as possible.

I think this post of yours provides complete information. When that happens there is less back and forth trying to find out what the exact circumstances are. We sure do wish the best to you; am glad you are exploring what might work for the entire family. Do know you will all have grieving and heartbreak and some few tears around this. That's normal. Not everything is easily fixed. Adjustment takes time.

{"post_id": "472965", "title": "Update: Towards my mothers situation.", "body": "I don't think I responded to your original post because I had seen certain people that I respect their opinions reply so I didn't.   Wandering is a Dementia thing. The one reason I placed my Mom in an AL was because at my house being a split level she was pretty much stuck in the room in the lower level. (She could not do stairs and I had 3 sets) The AL was like a square. The hallway went around inside the building with rooms on both sides. There were comfy chairs and couches book cases with books u could borrow. My Mom walked those halls a lot. Always coming back to the common area and dining/activity room. The AL had an outside area with a Gazebo and benches all around that was enclosed.  I think the care of a Dementia patient is beyond the care of a PCP. A PCP suggesting one on one care is not considering the cost to Mom. Because you should not be paying for that cost. My Mom was also in LTC. By that time she was wheelchair bound but could scoot around in that wc. The residents were allowed to wander the building. They are not confined. They would find one resident sleeping on another residents bed in another wing and walk her back to her wing. If Mom wanders at night there are sleep medications. There is also a night shift to keep an eye on her.   In my State ALs and MCs are private pay. Medicaid only gets involved when the resident has privately paid for at least 2 years. I was lucky 5 yrs ago to get Mom into an AL when they had a half price sale. It kept her cost just below 5k. Money ran out before 2 yrs so she was transferred to LTC with Medicaid paying. (Mom did pay 2 months privately) I see u have an appt with your State Medicaid. Be aware that their \"in home\" care may not pay for 24/7 care. Some States will only give a few hours. Can u be paid to be her caregiver or do they supply aides or do u go thru an agency that excepts Medicaid.  My daughter is an RN who worked in NHs with Dementia patients for 20 yrs. She was with me when we transferred Mom to LTC. After Mom was settled in my daughter said she thought I should have placed her earlier. No it wasn't perfect because Mom will never be cared for the way you would have cared for her. But my Mom was clean and cared for. On the whole the residents looked happy. I would visit and a staff member would be sitting talking to Mom. Others would tell me they had nice conversations with her. Mom was in her final stages.   So glad that you have made a geriatric psychiatric appt. Tests will now be done to determine where Mom is in her journey. What type of facility would most suit her. Kniwingcwhat type ofcDementia she has is important because of Medications.  Seems you are on the right track. Its just a matter of getting all the info you need to make informed decisions.

She likes to be out and about which is not an issue where we are because everyone knows her and she also knows the area very well. She is still operating on her long term memory at this point. The wandering more so will be an issue in places she is unfamiliar with.   They are willing to do an assessment but they told me not to hold my breath based off the conversation we had. I already knew AL was a long shot especially with me being honest with them going based off her worse day not the best. If I went based off her best then it would not be such an issue I think but that is unfair to the staff of the facilities rather be transparent with those involved in her care.   Like I exampled to them she is one of those residents that is easy to please just time consuming. I understand they are for 24/7 care but not a one-to-one companion service. That is more so where my mother is at she gets lonely and bored very easily unless she has some vested interest in the task and all parties are involved. Redirection is requires a more active approach since she still has some retention.   She is EO in terms of raw functional behavior but memory is more so at the Mid to serve stage. As her doctor has put it to me many times she is able to function based around her long deep seeded routine. We have explored medication in the past her current doctor has been against it. They are more in favor of non medication interventions. She has also been my mothers doctor since I was a kid. My mom still remembers them and trusts them.   Either way I have to get a proper assessment on medication management she will not last long without a care plan for when she gets anxious.

I got all my notes from the time I started taking notes back when all this was happening. I interviewed my brother my sister and from my memories I am pretty sure that I am going to have to so a lot of editing to put everything in the right order. When I get this book done I am going to put up my servers with roaming i.p. addresses and make it avelable for free for the first 90 days. I will post a link when I am done. I think that people should be armed with the information that I am about to give them. During our time having to deal with the hospital / Nursing Home this has taught me a few many things about how they operate. For example: The nursing homes hire the people that are the bottom of the barrel and they just show up do their jobs and collect a handsome paycheck every 2 week's. I mean you can tell the ones that are generally there for a paycheck and ones that truly care about the patient's / resident's; I can count 5 people at this nursing homes that where genuinely there for the patient's and not just the paycheck. here is one of the little tidbits that I am going to give you. If your loved one has to go in a nursing home for one reason or another you should look for one that is a non profit because they will give the resident way better care than a for profit nursing home; all the for profit's do are take peoples \"social security\" give them not very good food and are a lot more neglectful to the patient's than the ones that are non profit. and another one of my helpful tips is to watch out when they try to put your loved one on \"nursing home medicaid\" because they will take your original medicaid and your loved one \"Social Security\" Away and you will then become long term care and your loved one will be refereed to as incarcerated as one nursing home staff informed me of. If they are paying rent they will loose their place to live and they only way they will be able to get out is to leave \"AMA\" \"Against Medical Advice\" or have a family member that they can stay with and re-establish their life. The nursing home will try to sway your against this because they want that \"Social Security\" because the longer you are in there the more they get paid from the state because of your rooming and board. I think they also get grant's because the medicaid will pick up half of your cost and the grant will pick up the other half of your tab for being in their. So like I said I will post a link to my book when it is done so it can be downloaded for free for 90 days because I want everybody that can to read it because it is going to be armed with some very helpful information before you make that decision to put your loved one in any kind of a nursing home situation.", "date": "2021-12-24 03:05:09", "user_name": "trapwhisk", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

They raised me to be independent to know that the world would require that of me to go out on my own and make my own life and family to care for THEM in the best way I was able. They made themselves safe and comfortable by moving into a village in which care could progress for them as needed allowing them first a duplex then into apartment then onto different levels of care when needed. They saved all their lives so as not to be dependent on their children. They taught US my brother and me how to save. It is the eagle story you know.

But I promise you I will carry your lesson for life and I will do all I can to save my OWN babies\". This chick was carried to safety. The way of it is that our parents have children whether by choice happenstance. They do all they can for them given their limitations. And the children should pay this forward.

Maybe its the word 'owe' that is the problem. I do believe that no child abused by a parent should physically care for that parent. I don't think we should give up jobs and our homes to care for them. Bringing them into our homes is not always a good thing either.   Once we leave our parents home we really can't go back. (I had to and 1 year was enough) We change. We grow and mature. We have different experiences than our parents. Our views are no longer the same. We are now adults with jobs homes and our own families. But as we age so do our parents. They need to rely on someone and it should be their children. And as children we should at least make sure they are safe and cared for. Help find them resources. Set them up in a care facility. You can then walk away.   In a perfect world the child graduates from high school and maybe college. At that point the child starts a life of their own. Marries at that point that family becomes #1. Once the nest is empty the parent should be finding things that interest them get involved. New stage in their life. Neither child or parent should need to rely on each other. But that's not the real world. We have children who rely on parents to live and visa versa. Both spending money they don't have. Drugs and alcohol go both ways.   Its a shame that there is abuse in families and those who did the abusing then expect that child to care for them in their old age. And its a shame that that child feels obligated. In that situation a child needs to know its OK to walk away. We all need to set BOUNDRIES. What we can do and what we can't do. And it would be nice if our parents excepted this and did what needed to be done to be safe and cared for. Can't keep your house up then you downsize. Need 24/7 care then you go to an AL or LTC. You don't ask ur children to give up their lives so you can continue to live in a dream world. Its not being independent when you expect a child to do all the work and sacrifice so you can stay put.

There are many nice places and the rent is based on a sliding scale. So there are people of mixed incomes living in these places. They also allow home/health aides and usually have some of their own staff. If your mother possesses no independence then look at some care facilities to place her in. Start doing this now. I'll tell you what will happen if you don't. Not what might happen but what WILL happen. You become a slave of sorts and lose your own independence. Then because mom is paying the rent that will turn into her having to support you because you don't work and do nothing for her. If you think your life is a misery now just wait. Let your situation continue until weeks turn into months and months turn into years. Then you become me. There is no joy or hope. You live as a slave and at the mercy and whim of the person you're forced to take care of for free. You can look forward to them grinding you down into dust because they're the one paying the rent and \"letting\" you live in their house out of the goodness of their hearts. This is what your life will become. You become a loser in the eyes of everyone you know including yourself because you've been discounted devalued and abused for so long that it's become a way of life for you. Whatever love you had for mom disappears and turns to anger resentment and guilt. You will beat yourself up with guilt because of the anger you feel because the love you had for your mom is replaced with resentment and dread.

{"post_id": "471013", "title": "Update on Can I Sue The Nursing Home For Killing My Mother.", "body": "I am So sorry for the loss of your mom and for what you as a family endured during her care.   I will offer full support of your book and gladly add to it. I will tell you - I learned a lot from the CNA\u2019s that helped care for my mom and a few other amazing individuals but I mostly saw horrific care not only for my mom but by gosh all the people around her \u201cwho had nobody as their voice\u201d - I felt sick for the people who did not have loved ones to watch over them. I saw and heard negligence - I often felt like I was witnessing stuff in a third world country. I\u2019m ashamed of the care provided in my country. You can guarantee that somewhere right now someone or an elder is suffering neglect in a NH or SNF or even a well known hospital.   I am sure some of what you feel is grief but I believe you on witnessing neglectful care. I was with my mom most all times and she still had bruised eggs on her head from someone clearly trying to change her in the middle of the night alone and smashing her head into the railing (because she was dead weight in the beginning after her stroke and a 2 person assist) I also witnessed her fully aspirated with peg tube food all inside her oxygen mask because I had to be the one to tell them \u201cstep one turn the feeding tube off before lying her flat to wash her up\u201d (I learned this in ICU but clearly it was never taught to anyone after that). I had to write it and tape it all over the bed rails - hanging behind the bed etc so before they would press the button to lay flat they would see my sign and this was from hospital to acute care to rehab SNF - 95% of the time I had to say \u201cshut of the food so she doesn\u2019t aspirate\u201d.  If your loved ones level of care is higher then they should never be left alone. The medications given without reading \u201callergies\u201d - or wrong meds given out - my heart really feels your pain - as I don\u2019t doubt for one minute what you went through.  I do want you to know that your mother knew you watched over her - she knew you did everything you could and she without a doubt is at peace now and so proud of you and probably wouldn\u2019t want you to pursue law suits etc. she truly would want you to live and have a good life.  If you are doing something to help find better ways to protect ill or elders and it becomes a passion that you feel you can help someone else or another family or be a change in this horrible system then I fully support you. Just let it come from something good - let it be when you are fully ready and have healed from your grief - do it when you can put your heart in it and feel goodness from it. Don\u2019t let it steal anymore from you - when the time is right - it will feel as if you have a new journey to help others and that\u2019s when you pick up the pen and start writing your heart out \ud83d\udc95.", "date": "2021-11-05 21:46:55", "user_name": "Momheal1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

Glioblastoma is a horrible painful cancer that can take a life in weeks if not months. There are not many 'happy endings' to that particular cancer.   You are obviously still deeply grieving--as you say you see people when you go to therapy that you'd like to see people 'dead'--that's not terribly forgiving and comes across very hostile still. You will not get far with your book/legal case if you come across like that.   However--  If you want to write so you can feel some sense of catharsis that's up to you. I imagine you will have a hard time selling something of this nature. Slander and Libel and 2 attorney favorites and you kind of hit on both.   I agree some NH's are nightmares. Nobody would deny that. Did your mom receive the best care possible? We'll never know. But--she would have died of the cancer no matter what you did.   Attorneys will charge a fortune trust me. My son is one and sometimes I am absolutely appalled at the fees he charges. But he is a great attorney and will tell a client if he will represent them and how much it will cost--upfront. $5K is just for the initial consult and discovery. You could easily be charged $50K if this goes any farther and the hospital/ NH has attorneys too. Likely much more.   Personally I would spend more time in therapy and less in trying to place blame.

She proceeded to go headfirst into a telephone poll knocking down the wires for over 300 feet. The poll went across the road and thankfully no other cars or people were involved. Thankfully she had her Jitterbug on her and a woman driving by was able to find the emergency number and call me and 911!   In the end Mom was fine other than bruised ribs and ego. My brother and I made the decision to have her cease all driving. The condition was that in order for her to continue living with me she would have to agree to give up driving. She reluctantly agreed. She still complained she can\u2019t drive and even after her Alz diagnosis\u2026.still states she\u2019s fine and has no memory issues. Sometimes tough love needs to happen.

There are a million reasons they can't help and they all sound reasonable. I will warn you though talk to them and communicate about it. This resentment can become a monster (as it has in my family) if it's not addressed. It fractures families forever.   And yes you can blame them for \"living their lives\". YOU have a life too. Yours matters just as much and is as important as theirs. You have stepped in to do something that now that you're in it seems so so difficult to extricate yourself from because the parent still needs care. And if you don't do it who will? No one else is going to step up. They rely on you doing it all and not acknowledging you're doing it assuages their guilt for doing nothing.  I can't stress this enough. I'd address it with them. Plenty of people can still help in some way even if they live far away or have jobs. People do it every day. If they can't be there maybe they can help financially to get some caregiver help in.

I hope she will give me a certificate saying I have to rest for a couple of days... Otherwise I will take some days off... I really need to rest. I cannot avoid what is happening to my mum but I think I can stop working for a couple of days.  This time she called one of the journalists we work with (I work for a magazine) introducing herself as director of the magazine and asking the journalist to change the subject of her article. In the past she fired one of the journalists which she cannot do and so she was asked by the magazine director not to contact any of them... But she still does it. And she doesn't realises that the journalists will inform me as they do not know who she is and I have been working there for 19 years.", "date": "2021-03-18 16:51:21", "user_name": "Anche71", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/news-from-italy-465683.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

This is no different than telling someone with a peanut allergy to take a bite of that PBJ when they are hungry and \"just deal with it\". I consider this irresponsible bordering on criminal.

Or she may be trying to instigate some trouble making you the villain and your nephew will go rushing in to defend her. Instigating trouble for trouble's sake is common with elderly people. You are right about the rehab would have done something if you pushed her. That kind of behavior doesn't fly in a care facility. If you want to cut all ties with your family then that is what you will do. Please have a meeting with them and talk first before you take this action. A lot of the manipulating and lying could be your mother's doing. She may very well have dementia and could seem perfectly fine to everyone. They're not though. Often when the dementia is in its early stages and the person is still highly functional they will fixate on someone and turn on them for no rhyme or reason. That person becomes as you say the \"villain\". They usually start by accusing the villain of stealing from them. Then the villain deprives them of food and starts hitting and shoving them. Often when actually with the \"villain\" they're nice as pie as if nothing ever happened. Especially if there are other people around. I've been in elder homecare for many years. In those years I have been the dementia \"villain\" many times. It's always a lie. I've been replaced on some assignments but never fired because an elder with dementia showtimed so well that it was believable. I remember with distinction one client who accused me of the most heinous behavior. She had dementia but seemed very lucid and together. She was still highly functional too and lived alone. Her family had cameras all over the house and I was watched and heard every minute so they knew nothing was going on.  Your situation might be like this too. How about talk to your family and see what's up. Maybe it's not them. Don't become your mother's caregiver if she goes home though. Let your family figure out what to do with her not you.

{"post_id": "472575", "title": "Never volunteer to care for a senior.", "body": "The traps are these:  Dad was going to be homeless four years ago. I got him a place to live. Therefore he became my dependent in fact. After repeated falls and trips to the hospital a social worker threatened me with elder abuse for abandonment! (He lives in Hawaii I live in Virginia).  To move him out of the apartment and into Medicaid adult foster home the agency required me to sign papers saying if anything happens I will assume financial responsibility. I was okay with that until...  He Medicare/Medicaid hopped on 01 JAN. The new insurance would cover his adult foster home. Other insurances won't. If he hops to an uncovered insurance I'll assume financial liability. Oops!  Yet there's nothing I can do to stop it except stop service on his cell phone and isolate him. That's cruel. But if it's him or me... sorry dad.  This isn't the only thing. I had similar problems with his bank. Lots of borderline fraud. Bank wouldn't close the account. Dad wouldn't close it (didn't understand what was happening). I paid.  Also problems with co-pay for medication doctors hospitals. Insurance hopping caused problems with payments I had to straighten out or pay.  I won't go on but you get the point.

{"post_id": "471606", "title": "Don\u2019t feel like doing this anymore.", "body": "I am so fed up. In many ways I am the luckiest girl alive. I have a guy who will rope the moon if I asked and does everything in the world to make me happy.And in some important ways I can\u2019t imagine anyone unluckier than me.I don\u2019t know how I ended up 49yo unable to work earlier because of two autistic kids and then after a good career now unable to work because of two 80 yo parents who decided they\u2019d like to fill the shoes my kids left empty except they\u2019re not my kids and they\u2019re not cute.Between ten specialists for dad and three for mom breaking up their fights nonstop both physical and verbal driving around hunting down an old man who keeps taking off after fights expecting I\u2019ll find him and neither of them understanding a thing doctors tell them so I have to drive them to every appointment and be there for EVERYTHING\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m going to die soon if I continue doing this.Just 2.5 years ago I moved them to me in NV from CA because my dad was on oxygen 24 hours per day and admitted to the hospital constantly due to CHF \u2014 a condition he\u2019d apparently had for ten years except he didn\u2019t understand when he was diagnosed so I didn\u2019t know for ten years until I finally went to a cardiology appointment with him. I visited often enough when I lived 7-8 hours away but only for a few days at a time because it\u2019s draining being around their fighting. I didn\u2019t even realize the depth of how he had deteriorated mentally as well.In one month I sold off their lives and listed their house and moved them closer to me because I KNEW my dad was going to die and if that happened my mom would likely dig in and refuse to move.I got them their new place found every reputable specialist in NV including getting him into the Cleveland Clinic for his neurological issues and began to manage his plethora of fatal health problems and managed their entire lives.And he got better. He got better and didn\u2019t die because Mom and I dedicated everything to getting him better despite the odds and he lived. The better he got the worse he became as a person. At least if he couldn\u2019t breathe well \u2014 he was in bed and quiet.The level of energy these two have to battle it out is unbelievable. Without going into detail I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s bad. And somewhere along the way in the last two decades these two feel they need to tell me every detail of how awful the other one is. In the last two years it\u2019s almost like they tell me just to see if I\u2019ll side with the one doing the tattling. (And in 99% of the case it\u2019s my dad who is completely wrong and beyond reasoning but only he doesn\u2019t see it.)I do more than enough.Every single thing they need I have to find and make happen. I read every one of their mail and every time my dad decides he found a better deal for his insurance or a car loan or a mortgage I\u2019m the one who has to clean it up. Their cell phones act up - call me. Their TVs don\u2019t work - call me. iPads die \u2014 call me. Got a phone call \u2014 tell the caller to call me. Drug store claims some drug isn\u2019t available \u2014 \u201ccall my daughter.\u201d It\u2019s me for everything except grocery shopping.This isn\u2019t a life. They\u2019ve taken my life hostage and my life with my guy and my dogs\u2026.it just happens when I have moments leftover.My heart beats out of my chest and my pulse is so wild you can see it in my neck. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I ended up having two stents put in due to 100% blockage and have been diagnosed with diabetes.Tonight I was just screaming and screaming at my dad after having found him walking the streets going nowhere after they duked it out when I was called to find him \u2014 and felt like something burst in my head and for a couple of hours the eyesight in my right eye had a white flash in it. I\u2019m OK now but can\u2019t catch my breath.I am falling apart and at this rate they will outlive me. I never agreed to give them my whole life.

Having four of them potentially means a month's worth of weekly visits because there's no other way.  You can be antivax all you want. However some others of us are sitting here having to deal with seeing our los by law as well as not infecting them as possible.

When I was in my mid-40s their relationship significantly deteriorated and I had to constantly be the referee. It was a horrible position to be in. I swear I still have PTSD from the constant odd phone calls drama falls fights 911 calls. It went on for years. In my case my mom was the aggressor and my dad was beginning cognitive decline. There was also prescription drug abuse and alcohol use (not a good mix for 70 year olds). Anyway I eventually had to place my dad in memory care for his own safety. Mom refused to consider any other option (such as in-home care). It was chaos. I am an only child and there was no one else to step in. I thought my life was over.  I do believe placing my dad in memory care probably caused him to die earlier than he would have. To me the blame is on my mom for that. He died in 2019 after 3 years in the facility. Now I am stuck with her but through some good fortune I was able to get the house sold in 2020 and because of her alcohol relapses she ended up in ER/hospital/skilled nursing/assisted living. Unfortunately the physical &amp; occupational therapists have spent all of 2021 bringing her from wheelchair to rigid walker to rollator and now a cane. Last year at this time she was in a wheelchair in memory care babbling nonsense and now she is walking and wanting to live independently again.  I am not sure me or my marriage will survive another miraculous recovery on her part. I will be 55 in February. I have been stepping in and dealing with their sh*t since 2009.  I agree parents are absolutely not supposed to be like this. I never imagined either one of my parents would end up living a decade or possibly two in such a state.

As someone who is in a similar circumstance my first thought is to take care of your own health first. Immediately actually. I'm concerned about your eyes.

I don't know your situation but things didn't improve for me until I told my siblings that I quit. We started working together as a family after that meltdown. It's amazing what can be accomplished if you have help and support from family. If not hire the help and support.  During a discussion we had with an elder care attorney she told us about someone she had on staff. I can't remember the woman's title but the employee would go into the home and evaluate the loved one and then make recommendations for care. She was like a geriatric social worker.   My husband and I have been held hostage for so many years I'm embarrassed to say because neither of us had the gumption to stand up for ourselves.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "I'm a 36 year old only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7 I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills endless phone calls mountains of paperwork and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating.  Add to that I'm really sick of being a caregiver already and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week came home for a week went in for another week and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her and I feel bad about it. I apologized but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same.  I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot. I'm tired of being trapped in this house not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion. I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984 she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so.  The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings at home with me.  So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

She's been doing this for more than 6 months now so the 'prep' time should be long gone; if she was getting ready to pass away she'd have done so by now!

As you note It will also help you have a therapist--someone who will be in your corner and confirm what you already know--that you are in a deeply unhealthy relationship.  You might also find folks in similar situations at the alzheimer's org forums and join in the discussions there as well--it's more of a 'dementia' caregiver's forum than just for AD. A lot of this is so overwhelming...this forum and the Alz.org forum let me know that what I was seeing in my mom was not unusual and helped me understand how to handle some of our potential conflicts.

Hindsight is always best. Placed in a care facility your mom would get the best from you - and look forward to seeing you - and you would get the best from your Mom. I am so sorry you quit your job. I take care of my Mom full time but I had enough years in to retire with a comfortable income. My Mom has dementia and requires almost full time care but I have my brother who always helps out and is very cognizant of what my Mom needs. What you are doing is just. too. much. for. one. person. My Aunt is my support person (she lives in Florida) took care of her husband until she had to place him in nursing home. He died from Alz and diabetes. While he was in the NH she went at lunch time to make sure he ate and then at dinner time. She never missed a day. She also went to support groups and learned a lot. She tells me every time I talk with her - Number One: Never feel bad or guilty about losing your patience or temper or what you say or yell. Number Two: You are doing the hardest job in the world. Number Three: You are doing more than what most people would do. Number Four: No one else has ANY idea how hard it is - unless they have done it too. I really know how you feel about taking care of your Mom and not putting her in a nursing home but you really do need to think/consider about prioritizing some of your needs ahead of hers - such as working and having enough to live on and for retirement. I did therapy via zoom (or something like that) with a therapist that is near-by so I could see her in person some day and I highly recommend you do the same. I am really concerned that this is going to destroy you/your life the way it is right now. I really am. I also had a thought that maybe an attorney could get the medicare etc. in place instead of you doing it. At least if attornies do this you could get a price and see if it is feasible.

I got a recommendation from the SW or CM at the hospital from mum's last admission. I went with Visiting Angels because they had a local office in my parents town and when I called a real live person answered the phone. When I left a VM a real live person the same one multiple times called me back. They have have been great. Yes we got very lucky with an excellent aide who had capacity to take us on as a regular. If this is what you want make this known from the beginning with the agency. We have 3 times per week aide the same one every time for 3 hours a day. She mops the high use areas cleans the bathroom heats the food and makes sandwiches for supper washes the dishes and does the laundry takes out trash and provides them with some outside company and conversation. It is working out very well. She will go buy groceries if needed or pick up take away food too. The cost is less than $30/hr and if your mother has funds it is money well spent. You have to be involved at first. I was in the home when they started I wrote out check lists bought the cleaning supplies and stocked the bathroom and kitchen etc. But once you get a reliable aide with common sense and some experience after a couple of weeks of check lists its smooth sailing. I would Highly recommend them. But do be there when the aides first start coming so you can show them what is expected where things are and give them the low down on the parent - the good the bad and what you really need and expect. So they are not doing things you dont value and you are not always looking over their shoulder. Every day won't be perfect a couple times I found the trash was not taken out or the cat box was not scooped but 90% of the time its been great. We had only one who just came in sat on the sofa and played on her phone while my dad watched TV and talked to himself. (I walked in on this) But she was just a fill in for one day. The regular aides have been great and if/when they can't show the agency calls me direct and they will staff it with someone if at all possible. And as needs increase we can increase the coverage so they can stay in their home as long as possible. And if the aide cancels or quits the agency finds a replacement to staff your needs.

Small ice cream for dessert. Breakfast is Cheerios and a banana and a hardboiled egg and toast. You can go a long way on this routine. If she is still smoking stop that immediately. get her a nicotine patch if she has cravings. Stop the sugared soda immediately and get club soda or zero calorie soda options. It all costs the same get the healthy stuff. Give her the routine baths in am or pm change of clothes MWF or whatever. Change the sheets and towels on a routine.

Doing everything for them is not a big issue for me though sometimes I find it irritating.   There are two distinct parts I just cannot stand.  (1) It\u2019s the dynamics of their awful angry relationship that affects me. It\u2019s just unbelievable to me that at 80 years of life with death up right ahead knowing one of them may not wake up tomorrow and that would not be surprising \u2014 this is how they want to spend what could be their last day of life. How sad for them\u2026and how pitiful for me to watch it firsthand.  (2) My dad is just mentally unfit. He\u2019s a well-educated MBA man who worked to the high ranks at a US conglomerate before retiring and he\u2019s deteriorated to making no sense and can\u2019t process what he hears be it in English or Korean. Can\u2019t hear that well and what he does hear he can\u2019t process. (They\u2019re concluding its vascular dementia but specifically not Alzheimer\u2019s which has been ruled out.) And everyone can see it EXCEPT HIM. He\u2019ll still actually tell me he knows better or he doesn\u2019t need the likes of me etc. unaware he can\u2019t do anything for himself.  Worse he creates more work for me having to undo these ridiculous scams he falls for \u2014 Cheaper Medicare! Better refinancing rates! Save money with solar! Free HBO! \u2014 and so forth. All the calls and paperwork I have to do for them doesn\u2019t anger me but when he MAKES trouble\u2026 I just get enraged. And he\u2019s not even apologetic; he says \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Call and cancel it and stop acting like you\u2019re doing something extraordinary!\u201d  Everything else meh \u2014 I\u2019ll live. I make all the food they love and have them over or deliver it and go out to dinner with them every week. I take them out to social activities they like and my husband is a good sport about going with us. When they have to drive a ways to meet friends and it\u2019s nighttime we drive them there and find something to do for five hours so they can have fun. They need only get dressed and wait for me on the days we have appointments and attend; they don\u2019t need to listen to one thing the doctors say or follow up with a single item \u2014 I do it all. Literally all they have to do is not create chaos and I\u2019m willing to go to the ends of the earth to make their last years easy for them but it\u2019s like they\u2019re hellbent on sending me off first!

I'm 39 and like you I was extremely overwhelmed in the beginning of my caregiving journey. My mom passed last month and the finality of her being gone is a tough adjustment; but I would have continued my sacrifice just to have her here. I don't know if you believe in something higher than yourself but I advise that you pray and turn to the word whenever you are feeling stressed resentful angry etc etc. I also advise trying to seek counseling/therapy to help with coping mechanisms while this journey lasts. I had no counsel in the beginning and I was my only help. I cared for my mom from roughly 18-39 years of age and that story in itself is something made for a movie which I won't divulge right now as I'm trying to be brief. In addition to what most of your supporters have mentioned regarding seeking someone to give u a break every week or so if it's financially possible or applying for Medicaid so she can have home health aides with her during the day while you tend to your needs you must also focus on your health and well being. We are consumed when caring for our loved ones that we tend to neglect ourselves. I have had way too much experience with hospitals rehab facilities etc etc. The healthcare system is broken and changes must be made. If your parent requires 24/7 care and help the countless facilities I have experienced will cause a decline in their health. Thank God for his blessings over my strength and patience as I was there from sun up to sundown once I realized the care given is not present so I was pretty much an unpaid worker whenever she was hospitalized or in a facility. Places lack the number of staff needed to help and nurses are overwhelmed with too many patients and when you witness this for over 2 decades it's heartbreaking and the quality of care is nonexistent. If ever you need to talk about the nitty gritty when it pertains to ALL THINGS related to caregiving please reach out. I tended to all my mom's countless needs and as time progressed more issues arose so I was in charge of medication administration feeding tube care tracheostomy care you name it....I was even taught how to give her antibiotics via her pic line at home. I have learned so much that I would not mind sharing with you or anyone else for that matter. Please pray and try your best to love her through her illness.

I moved them here because it was clear they couldn\u2019t manage their care anymore. Be it a sick dad or sick mom I can\u2019t live with the fact that either died without my having done all I could.   Contrary to what I make it sound like in my original post (1) they were not bad parents to me growing up all things considered; and (2) I actually don\u2019t regret moving them here to manage their care. Even doing everything for them is not altogether torture for me in that giving them a few full-time years of my life to ensure a comfortable ending is still worthwhile to me. I\u2019m lucky to be able to do that. I know that.  It\u2019s that they hate each other and live off this drama that kills me. It\u2019s that they have zero qualms about involving me in this drama of theirs letting \u2014 no demanding and forcing \u2014 their daughter witness the ugliness and misery they cause each other at the end of their lives that just\u2026rots me. It\u2019s truly like a black mold that just spreads and I hate it. That is what I feel \u201cparents\u201d shouldn\u2019t do. I hate that my parents do this and I hate that I let it get this close to us.   I have asked and begged to be left out of it. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care that my dad took off again or that they had a blowout fight but I do not want to be involved in that part. I don\u2019t want to know and if they can\u2019t handle their own tempers to ensure they live peacefully they should deal with the repercussions of that on their own too. I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m savage and callous - but they don\u2019t understand I really cannot operate like this.  I\u2019ve explained that my life and my relationship with my husband are so peaceful and zen BY CHOICE and that I can\u2019t deal with the constant animosity they bring into it.

My sister and I live petrified that I will turn out like this.  Because this part comes with the other parts I willingly manage and like you said it was my decision when I knew their relationship was not great when I moved them here (since they involved me in that part then too though in my defense I had no idea to what extent or frequency this happened!) I do regret my decision\u2026.now.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "What a great thread. This has been a very valuable discussion for me as I'm sure for the original poster. My Mom is turning the corner on being 88 and just beginning to exhibit some memory issues and has incontinence issues. She's in excellent health otherwise. I've gotten her health POA and permissions to discuss her care with her GP Medicare etc. She agreed to do this so that I wouldn't have to deal with all that should she get sick. She lives by herself in a house built by her and my Dad. I moved long distance to live near her 6 years ago when my Dad passed away. My husband and I do lots of little things for her and we're happy to do it however she's beginning to let the house fall into disrepair. I had to have a talk with her to let her know that if she wanted to stay in her house she would need to get things fixed. She is financially well off so money is not the issue. I think she gets overwhelmed when there are too many things to take care of so she just ignores some things. I found a handyman to begin repairing and replacing some of the important things like getting one of her door locks replaced because it was broken. She reasons things away like this by saying she lives in a gated community and no one would be able to get in. Ugh! Her front door locks were oxidized and the key would no longer work so those are being replaced too. When I tried recently to get her to have other things fixed she said it was too much too fast. Big argument there so I let it go. I'm going to try again after Thanksgiving. Her memory issues worsened over the summer. It comes and goes. We live in an area where people live here 6 months out of the year (we call them snowbirds). Her friends are returning and she's as happy as a clam. She's been hacked three times and I worry that it's only a matter of time before it happens again and harm is done. (thankfully I caught all three in progress and averted the worst).  Problems with long and\u00a0short-term memory:\u00a0 1. forgetting that's she's already asked the a\u00a0question just\u00a05 minutes later repeats herself. Seems to come and go.\u00a0 2.Often reintroduces me to those I've known for several years. 3.Showed up a day early to pick up friends for dinner another day an hour early.\u00a0 4. Forgets that she's ordered something online or orders an excess of items.  5. Has several piles of mail around the house.  6. Can't keep up with her emails (I have access to that and clean out the spam for her)  7. It's hard for her to make phone calls for\u00a0things that need\u00a0taken care of or fixed. Gets confused as to who's who with vendors. 8. She has items that should have been returned a year ago sitting on her desk.  The list goes on and on.

She was 85 yrs old when she came here to live in a home just 2 doors away from me. She just gave me the power to take over all her finances and keep the orderly running of her home. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. She was up and down in her health and my life became doctor visits taking her out to places she would enjoy and food shopping for her. I lost my own life completely. If the electric went out during a storm I worried. If we had a blizzard and couldn\u2019t get out I worried. Every minute of every day was thinking about her her bills that needed to be paid her medication refills her congestive heart failure problems her growing breast cancer her taking a shower just everything that a person needs in order to live comfortably. She was able to do so because I gave up everything for her. And I did resent her. She would not have done that for me. Now that she is passed - at age 95 (this past summer) I feel relieved but I am still stuck. I urge you to think about a facility that can care for her at her level of care. This is a situation that will eat you alive. I developed Non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 5 yrs into my caretaking and I know it was due to stress the first years of caring for her. I am still treating. I don\u2019t know how long I have as I am stage 3b and there are only 4 stages. My body could not take the stress of actually taking over someone else\u2019s life. I kept a diary of sorts for the first few years and when I read back on it I don\u2019t know how I did it. It was a terrible time for me. My mother had it good but I did not.

Mother Teresa would have trouble handling the frustration. And there are people who did everything right for their health and still end up with dementia and multiple physical problems. We do not know the causes of so many diseases.   I would suggest finding a geriatric psychiatrist. They are very hard to locate - but well worth it. They can offer medications that ameliorate many of the behaviors you describe. The behaviors you describe are intolerable for anyone - it is not a case of your lack of patience or love.  You are finding this hard because it is the hardest job anyone will ever do. Medicare should cover an aid 3 times a week to help with bathing and dressing. They should also cover a social worker to come to your house and let you know what services are available in your area.    I am so sorry you are going through this nightmare at such a young age. It will pass. The workforce you left will take you back. The patience creative problem solving organizational skills communication and task completion skills you are honing now will enhance your value to an employer.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Might I make a few observations and suggestions.  1 - Your mom's care will be overwhelming if you are the only person caring for her 24/7/365. Burnout is inevitable if you do not get enough \"time off\" to meet your own health needs and social needs.  2 - While I admire your dedication to your mom and her care you are neglecting your own retirement. You need to secure your own financial state first and being with mom second. Nobody can secure your finances or retirement but you.  3 - Everything seems overwhelming. You need to sort out the issues and create a plan. Meeting with a social worker and a counsellor - even televideo meetings can help. The social worker can help you locate and access all the resources available for your situation. A counsellor can help you sort out the emotional overload and create a healthy plan for dealing with your mom.  4 - There are lots of ways that you can work get enough time off and help care for mom. You can not care for her 24/7/365 alone.   a - Ask for help from family friends community of faith and paid help. Some folks will be OK with sitting your mom for a few hours weekly. Others may be able to help with household tasks: housekeeping meals yardwork running errands...  b - if you can not get enough help to care for mom at home then it is time to look at outside resources. Adult Day Care is a Monday through Friday daytime option; they care for mom in a nursing home of private home while you work. Home health aides can also watch mom in your home while you work. Assisted living usually consists of having a private room or suite with home health aides that assist throughout the day. Full care is for those that need frequent care by others. Check to see if mom's insurance and finances will cover any of these services.   c - If mom doesn't have enough finances help her apply for Medicaid. Help her also apply for Medicare and any other public help. You can make an appointment with Social Service. It might help to review their websites and gather all documents needed. If your mom ends up in the hospital again ask social services to help you with these tasks.   d - If mom needs to use Medicaid for help she may be best served in a residential facility that takes Medicaid clients.   A good daughter or son makes sure that their parents are cared for... even if it means you can not do the hands-on care yourself.", "date": "2021-11-18 09:56:23", "user_name": "Taarna", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-new-to-caregiving-and-trying-not-to-drown-in-it-471198.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},
{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Oh goodness. I saw this in my email inbox and I knew that I had to come by and say something. My mom passed away last year. I am 39 years old. And I took care of my mom for 13 years. My mom was 75 much older than your mom but I took care of her from age 25-38. After my dad passed away I was her caregiver.   Listen sweetie. I said the same things as you about how I would never put her in a nursing home and how she didn't want to go anyway.   I miss my mom so much. I burst out crying yesterday because a memory came to me so vividly about her. But there is so much CLARITY now that she is gone. I love her to pieces but she would have been so much better off if at the age of 25 I put her in assistant living. Because at the time she was at least able to walk with a walker and in the beginning I only did things like laundry and cooking and standby assistance for showers. Gradually she got worse took a few falls messed up her back. Became bedridden during the last 6 years of her life.   I was her ONLY caregiver. She did have CNAs coming to bathe her 3 times a week which was helpful but even with that it was a burden. (Ask the doctor to order you this if she has Medicare she should be able to get CNAs to come bathe her). My mom was a fiery woman used to be very independent and always got her way. Very sweet though. She wasn't horrible I'm just saying she was a woman that knew what she wanted. It was... HARD. My brothers off in other states with their family. We had no family here. It was just me. I managed bills her pills her dressing Hoyer Lifts taking her to doctors appointments her dentures her voiding and bowel movements. The whole nine.   I still sometimes here a sound (probably my neighbors) that makes me think its her and I have an urge to jump up and run to see if she needs help. The PTSD-like crap will get to you. I don't even know if it's PTSD. It's something.   Look. I joined a gym and MADE time for myself when I was taking care of my mom. You have to. You HAVE to go on a walk or do yoga. You matter too.   But anyway.... I was saying before... that I have such clarity now. I would have done everything differently. And one thing that I learned... no matter how much your mom says she doesn't want to go to a nursing home the fact is she's just scared. Deep down any sensible human would choose a nursing home over putting burden on someone they love. But she isn't sensible. She's knocking pills out of your hand and she has had strokes. She's sick. So she can't think logically about the matter but you can.   You'd be able to visit your mom in a nursing home even take her out shopping or out to lunch sometimes come by and visit her and tell her about a new guy or job in your life. About your new yoga class. Have photos for her to look at. Grandkids for her to visit with. All these things I wish I could have done with my mom but can't because I never gave myself a life.   You need to take care of yourself.", "date": "2021-11-18 09:55:59", "user_name": "thepacifist", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-new-to-caregiving-and-trying-not-to-drown-in-it-471198.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

Well since then we tried to get several attorneys everyone seemed like they wanted a $5.000.00 fee because they where not sure wether they could win or not. Then my brother had a serious discussion with me; he said that our mom would not want us to sue anybody. I was very angry with the nurses and doctors that I felt took my moms life to soon. Well the long and short was there was never a law suit because my brother convinced me that they did everything they could even-though some aspects of that I would have to strongly disagree with but I did get some grief counseling with my sister and it helped tremendously. I had a serious problem because my grief had me going to a place where I truly wanted to see some people not living anymore yes I mean the nursing home staff and some of the doctors but I worked through all of that I had to go to some pretty intense therapy sessions before I just had to let that go and just be at peace with the fact that my mom was no longer in pain with that brain tumor. It was called a Gleioblastoma one of the most aggressive tumors that there are. I am however writing a book called \"The Dangers of Hospitals and Nursing Homes\" to make people more aware of thigs like what are they really getting themselves into and stuff like about how they are going to become the \"Enemy Number One\" if they are there most of the time to watch out for their loved ones and exposing what the care in a nursing home is really like. I am doing this post pandemic and I will mention that in the preface of my book. I want it to get into the hands of people that have put their loved on into a nursing home or had to do it because they had no other choice. I am going to sell it send it to talk shows news stations etc... etc... etc... I want everyone to know the kind of crap they will pull if they can get away with it. For example there where Nurses Aids that would literally hide from us when we needed to get their help. There was an inspection from the nursing homes higher ups and they where literally told to avoid the inspectors if the came their way. They told them to go the other way. I got charged for co-pays after my mothers death that they where not suppose to charge after her death. When a person dies they are no longer responsible for any bill that that loved one had there was a guy stealing out of the nursing home patients funds that the family's put in for the patients so they had some money for themselves he invested it in football tickets and sold it to other people at a huge markup. He got arrested and killed himself in jail. I didn't get to take them to court but I am going to expose them to the public so they cant hurt anybody else.", "date": "2021-11-05 01:53:11", "user_name": "trapwhisk", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Elder Abuse", "End of Life", "Grief"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

Propaganda like this feeds the mentality that the only solution is to be a caregiver at home no matter what the cost mentally emotionally or physically\u2014and sometimes a combination of these. Doctors did a study and found that caregivers had a 63% higher mortality rate than others given similar variables. Were you ever a caregiver at home? If not you have no idea of what it takes to take care of someone especially with glioblastoma. Where would you have taken her if not a nursing home? You don\u2019t even mention what ways you think were detrimental to her. It doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re providing an alternatives so there\u2019s nothing constructive about this book. It\u2019s already common thinking that nursing homes are bad so why spread a generalization as truth?   At 65 my brother was diagnosed with glioblastoma. He needed 24/7 care. I found an excellent nursing facility on the Medicare website and placed him there along with getting hospice care. He\u2019s been there nine months and they\u2019ve both provided wonderful care. There was an inspection and his case was chosen to be examined. His tumor greatly affected his judgement impulsivity problem solving and his personality. It\u2019s evident that my brother is loved and cared for. Recently it looked like his death was eminent. For people upset because their loved one isn\u2019t being fed hospice explained to us that because his body is starting to shut down so he doesn\u2019t need much food if any. They lose the ability to swallow so feeding runs the risk of inhaling food and causing pneumonia. He\u2019s rallied some but now he\u2019s at the point where his brain says to get up but his legs are weak so he falls. Sometimes he refuses the meds that would calm down this activity. They can\u2019t force him to take them. Fortunately he\u2019s five feet from the nurses station so they can keep a closer eye on him. It\u2019s driving the nurses crazy because they want him to be safe but they can\u2019t restrain him and can\u2019t post an aide there 24/7. Obviously they care and worry about him.   So yes there are bad nursing homes\u2014I removed him from a previous one. But don\u2019t do a blanket smear job. Nursing homes are short on staff.

If a person has a relatively high income but is paying a fortune in medical and pharmacy bills they may well qualify.

Eight hours later and well after dark (she hasn't driven after dark in years) the police were just about to put a vulnerable adult alert out on Twitter with photos of her and the car. My husband was on the phone with adult child #2 filling him in (we didn't want him to find out when his friends said hey isn't that your grandma on Twitter?) when her residence called to say she had breezed back in thanks to a Good Samaritan who had guided her back from the grocery store. Where else she had been she can't say.  The next day I \"stole\" her car. It is in the garage in her house which she still owns.

Lucky you did not break anything. Sorry about not getting support form your mother. She might be aware of your problem at first but forgot. Try not to take it personally. I know it is hard but you do not need any added stress. That is what I do most of the time and if it still bothers you I would have a serious discussion and explain your feeling. You would feel better once you get it off your chest. I had some major health problems in the past and I told my mother and she felt bad in the moment and then forgot about my problem. I wanted her support more than anyone else in the world at a time in my life when I could have died but with her memory loss the support was only there for a brief period of time. My mother was always concerned about her family. She would always put others first. As a declining elder and lots of health problems she has been more focused on herself. I do not take it personally because she was never like that before and I know it is difficult for her. I love her unconditionally. It is difficult to see some changes in her but mostly she is her sweet self.  I hope you start to feel better soon. It might have been lots of stress that caused to to fall and hit your head. It happened to me while my mom was in the ER. I had new shoes on and was rushing to let my niece in the door to the ER and my foot got stuck to the tile floor and I took a flip and hit my head against the wall I was on blood thineeres at the time.. I was in the same room as my mother overnight. It was definately stress and lack of sleep. Take care of yourelf get support from other family members if possible and get help when needed.

I have Been BLISSFULLY no contact since March of 2020 \ud83d\ude03 lots of drama regarding her living in our rental with roommates and hoarding. To many comments and shitty behaviors towards me an my only child Dear Husband.  My husband hasn\u2019t seen his mother since he moved her out of the rental in July of 2020. Yes her crap and roommates crap stayed in our rental for months! I had to send a formal letter stating we would pay 1 month of storage. Mind you she had help from my husband our daughter (17) and flying monkeys to move.  DH has finally come out of the FOG. He still has some work to do in regards to her guilting him over the phone. He hasn\u2019t seen her since July 2020.  Her bday is this weekend and he has offered to have our daughter drive her and her FM (flying monkey) to our cabin property that has been passed to him. Falling apart when we got it.  Im worried she is going to pull some form of guilt and he will get into a funk/bad mood. I\u2019m hoping that DD driving her 1-1/2 hours to and from the property will alleviate her guilting him on the car ride if he had to take her lol. She only shows her crappy side to DH her brother and me. DD is my child from a previous marriage\u2026 so she\u2019s not family (MIL words)  Im torn between wanting her to behave and wanting her to mess up. DH said if she acts up\u2026he has done his diligence in trying to spend time with her.  I refuse to get her a gift. He bought her a card. In the past we would splurge and take her out and she would invite her FM and order to the nines. Also would invite herself and 2 uncles b-day (they don\u2019t get along) they ordered over $350 worth of cocktails and surf/turf grrrr many more stories of her thinking we are her piggy bank (she can well afford things btw) sorry got side tracked \ud83d\ude02.  hugs to you guys in healing from these Monsters!  oh yeah (ex-foster child here) she has stated more than once to me that we should do things for her because \u201cI know you don\u2019t know this but that\u2019s what family should do\u201d her words.

As others here have observed and advised you your planned revelations are too dangerous will expose you to legal action and (IMHO) will not alleviate the anger you feel.  2.\u00a0 Your hostility and anger shows\u00a0 and DOMINATES loud and clear.\u00a0\u00a0 Attorneys sense this and can avoid becoming involved with someone hell bent on revenge by setting high retainer costs.\u00a0\u00a0 Attorneys do not need to be counselors and expose themselves or their staff to someone who seems to be vindictive angry and immune to helpful advice.  3.\u00a0\u00a0 You don't understand medical malpractice law and your method of expressing the alleged grievances doesn't fall within legal parameters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only people who are going to read your \"publication\" are those with similar approaches.  4.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter sentence also addresses how you will open yourself to either ignoring your online \"book\" or worse yet to retaliatory action from medical facilities especially if you're foolish enough to identify them.  5.\u00a0 If action in the last sentence occurs you could find yourself facing not only action against your own server access\u00a0but also restraint and cease and desist orders by the named facilities.\u00a0\u00a0 You could also face libel actions.\u00a0 You could be restrained by injunctive relief.\u00a0\u00a0   6.\u00a0\u00a0 You likely would be sued including for defamation.\u00a0\u00a0 The defense attorneys would probably file a motion for summary judgment to restrain you from further action but you would also likely be required to pay the costs of those you identify.\u00a0\u00a0 That means ALL COSTS ranging from time to copy and analyze your complaints have them reviewed by attorneys and/or medical people and the cost of filing a lawsuit with potential cease and desist prayers as well as the cost of serving any injunctive orders against you.  7.\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have several thousand dollars to engage in this hopeless endeavor?\u00a0 If not once the defense prevails judgments and \"cease and desist\" orders could and probably would be issued against you and either carried out through seizure orders or through a lien against your property.\u00a0 How would you handle that?\u00a0 Do you have enough money to pay off a multi-thousand dollar judgment and/or buy a new house?  8.\u00a0 This next comment is NOT intended to be cruel but it needs to be said.\u00a0 Caring for someone ranging from children to ill parents is very challenging emotional and frequently requires personal assessment.\u00a0 None of us want to feel as those we didn't handle these issues well.\u00a0\u00a0 We're often in territory none of us ever expected to be.\u00a0 We're struggling just as you were and are but it needs to be realized that leveling blame and hostility doesn't reverse anything.

Men women and children go of this and further treatments can just amount to torture. If you have researched glioblastoma I am certain you know the statistics on it. It explodes through the brain like an ink blot spreading fingering out into the brain like a spider's web. As a nurse and as a person who lost a dear friend who died of a glio very young I can sympathize completely with your pain even if I do not with your overall view of nursing care.  I am glad you have some peace and know your Mom would be glad of that as well. Your book will keep you busy. You have lots of research to do.

They have been very helpful!", "body": "I want to begin by saying thank you to you all for your posts and encouragement on these forums. They have been very helpful to me. I don\u2019t post (until now) but I do read what others have posted in situations similar to my own.We had another rough Christmas this year with my narcissistic parents and I need to vent a bit and get some feedback if possible. In a nutshell I am 55 the oldest (daughter) with a 51-year-old brother who is a drug addict felon and homeless. He is the golden child and I am the scapegoat. My parents both 75 moved 6 hours away from our hometown where we all resided about 12 years ago. They both take lots of medications including antidepressants etc. which is beginning to affect them cognitively. The distance has been a good thing for us though.I have cut off all contact with my brother due to his addictions choices and behaviors. I do not discuss my brother with my parents especially my mother. Last year in about September I received a phone call from my father stating that they were driving down here to pick up my brother and take him back to their home in Tennessee. At Christmas my husband and I had to drive up there and remove him from their home as he was taking advantage of them not working and doing drugs. I knew this was going to happen but had to wait until there was a crisis. My mother keeps trying to \u201csave\u201d him and gets my father to go along with her plans.This Christmas they wanted to drive down here to celebrate with me and my family and Mom asked if my brother could come celebrate with us. Of course I said no and she got mad at me. They came they acted perturbed and stayed in the bedroom much of the time when they were here. They would come out in the evening to watch tv with us and one night out of the blue my father told me in front of my husband \u201cI\u2019m going to kick your butt!\u201d Twice. I just said \u201cOk. Pop.\u201d When I told Mom about it later she giggled and said \u201cThat\u2019s your Father!\u201d Then on Christmas eve we had a big family gathering with our 5 kids and their families. My mother decides to show out in front of everyone (she loves an audience) and screams my name at the top of her lungs from the bedroom upset about my father not wanting to wear an ugly Christmas sweater. Then she comes out yelling at me and I corner her in the dining room away from everyone to let her \u201cvent\u201d and not cause too big of a scene. And yes I was very embarrassed but I handled it ok. On Christmas day they met my brother at a truck stop for a meal came home went to bed packed up and left early on the 26th. I purposefully did not communicate with them for 3 days since that time and have had limited contact since then as I am done with this situation. My mother knows something is up as she has been texting me more frequently telling me what a \u201cwonderful\u201d visit they had. I told her I was on vacation from my cell phone and spending time with my husband who was off for the holidays.My parents are very secretive about things and will not tell me anything about anything regarding their life plans etc. I have finally let it all go and will intervene when something happens. I will continue to be the responsible daughter I should be but from a great distance. My husband and I have a wonderful marriage 5 awesome and well-adjusted adult children and 1 sweet granddaughter. This is what I will be focusing on from here on out.FYI\u2026(I went through several years and thousands of dollars of therapy about 15 years ago to deal with the dysfunction I grew up in and to get to this place in my life. I am very protective of who I am now my family and where I am in my life).

She had been eating very little ( a few bites of food or some soup then I'm full) in the past couple of months but still her usual level of cognition and up and about in her wheelchair. My kids were going to be at their inlaws for Christmas this year so we all got together the Sunday before to have a meal and exchange gifts. My sister and family my 2 adult kids and their families. I brought mom from her MC facility and she enjoyed it especially the great grand baby hugs. We took lots of pictures.Then the next day on Monday she decided that she just wanted to sleep they couldn't get her out of bed; I thought she probably was just tired out from the long day before but it continued on Tues just able to get her a few bites of pudding with her meds and a little water. Then Wed back to normal sitting upate having a nice visit with her cousin. So I thought ok just needed some downtime. Then Christmas eve it all changed. Back to bed not eating sleeping not able to rouse at all would mumble and shift in bed hold your hand but not open eyes. Hospice doctor decided to hold meds since she had lost weight maybe that was making her too drowsy that they might be building up in system and need adjusting. But it just didn't do anything. So I had to make a call whether to accept this was the end that maybe she had had a brain event did I want to take her off hospice and hospitalization for feeding and hydration etc. Based on her weight loss from before and her changes in cognition in the last few months ( more trouble with words difficulty eating) I said no. But it was difficult. They kept saying she was a strong lady because it's probably only a \" couple of days\" was 10. They had oxygen on hand for comfort if she needed but the morning she died her oxygen sat was 91. She just slept and held our hands until the last day. They administerd a low dose of morphine only a couple of times over those days when they bathed and changed her as she exhibited some distress then. And again once on the last day as her breathing was more rapid. I'm going to miss her but there is relief in there too because these last few years was not how she wanted her life to go and was hard. But she lived independently until age 89 and was loved and respected by many", "date": "2022-01-05 11:10:22", "user_name": "Gracie61", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Caregiver Support", "End of Life", "Mom"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/my-mothers-long-goodbye-has-ended-472167.htm"},

You're obviously very upset about the standard of care and I don't blame you.  Every hospital and/or primary care trust has a PALS team. It takes time but you can approach these people to raise your concerns and ask questions about the negligence/neglect you believe caused your friend's death.   Did you see your friend's \"Respect\" form? The reason I ask is that these forms detail what level of care any individual of any age has stated he or she wants to receive in the event that they need interventions when they're not able to make decisions. There has been controversy about them in the last year or two because as in every bureaucratic system (which the NHS certainly is as even its best friends would not deny) the strong emphasis on getting patients to complete them has led to too many reported cases of the job's being done clumsily heartlessly hastily sometimes to the great distress of the patient's friends and family when for example they don't agree with the patient's choice of DNACPR.

Unless a capable patient or their legal spokesperson signs a DNR for the file CPR will always be performed in the event of cardiac arrest. It is more likely that your friend didn\u2019t want the quality of life putting her body through CPR and fixing the underlying cause of her heart stopping would most likely provide and chose to be a DNR herself. It\u2019s not something the hospital can decide for a patient.   Depending on her consciousness and swallowing ability amongst other things they may very well have kept her dentures from her they can be both a choking hazard and a barrier to air/breathing adjuncts if needed in an emergency. Dentures are always taken out before surgery and often held out for a while for these medical reasons. But if she was eating or cleared to eat solid foods sitting up and breathing fine unfortunately they may have been overlooked like her glasses and watch. Hospitals rehabs and nursing homes were understaffed before COVID now the nursing and support staff are more than overworked it\u2019s amazing they keep their heads above water at all. I think it has always been the case that the more a patients family and friends can be around to help with those things as they know the patient best and are able to devote their full attention to that one person the better for that patient. It is a crime that the people who chose caregiving as a profession simply don\u2019t have the time to spend attending to these things for their patients believe me most are as frustrated as you that they don\u2019t but when you consider the things that take precedent it\u2019s hard to argue because you want those things to take precedent when it comes to your LO too. It\u2019s too bad your friend didn\u2019t have anyone who was able to be around to take care of these things for her.  It sounds like she had an IV set up with fluids to help combat her dehydration maybe another indication she wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep hydrated herself. That is a closed system there wouldn\u2019t be any air in the bag or lines to pump into her. The bag is supposed to run out and they measure how much fluid they put in over a period of time and how much comes out so an empty bag not being replaced rite away is normal and not dangerous though they typically do remove the bag the next time they are in the room and close off the IV line until it\u2019s time for the next bag. Only certified people are able to do this though not just anyone who comes in the room.  I would be very surprised if many COVID deaths weren\u2019t DNRs as well so many have been elderly but that isn\u2019t what killed them. Performing CPR on a patient with COVID that advanced may prolong their life hooked up to breathing machines and comatose but that\u2019s not the way I would want to go nor is it something I would want for someone I care about.  It sounds like your friend was a strong vibrant woman who had lived a full life and wanted to continue living a full life. Which is exactly why she probably signed a DNR if she couldn\u2019t live life her way she preferred to pass as peacefully as possible CPR is not peaceful. DNRs don\u2019t kill people they allow them to pass with dignity.  The thought that a facility wants to allow their patients to pass just isn\u2019t logical they don\u2019t make any money on a dead patient they only get paid to care for living patients.I know you are grieving and I don\u2019t doubt that the care she got wasn\u2019t as attentive as she deserved but I can\u2019t think of any reason for a facility to knowingly kill her or how a DNR would be a method to \u201ckill\u201d or \u201cmurder\u201d someone.

In 40 days in the beautiful new facility they never did anything like this. Here she says everything is nice she became friend of another lady whom she eats with and who encourages my mom to eat more!

I am now relaxing and sleeping for 8 hours per night! I can\u2019t recall when I could last do this! but I am still very angry with the other facility and wonder if I can do something to stop their bad behaviour.

Grief also happens and sometimes it happens to look just like this post.   Tooth - I am sorry this happened to you and that you feel your loved didn\u2019t matter enough to those who made that decision. I see she meant a lot to you - she most likely knew that very well. Thank you for caring for her and about her so much.   There we\u2019re plenty of drs since my moms stroke that made statements or tried to influence their views and also ones who made their own conclusions when meeting her with UTIs. Is my moms journey a hard one - Yes! When asked if she wants to live or is happy with the decisions we have had to make for her - her answer is yes she wants to be here and she would have made the same decisions thus far. For now she is happy that she got 3 more years . Others have gone in early morning during UTI treatments to persuade her to sign one and then come to persuade me to do the same - and not once or twice but over and over - it is not okay. I do not have rose colored glasses on -I am not blind to our lives - I like drs who give me the truth so I can prepare as best I can - I am a communicator - I want to know what every option looks like - but I have also had more (in hospital settings) try to shove their opinions down our throats than not. When it doesn\u2019t feel like actual helping families make hard decisions and feels more like \u201cthey are telling you what your choice should be\u201d it does leave people questioning if they did the right thing. I know they see what happens during resuscitation -but Moms last UTI (she was out of it from the meds and infection and they acted like she wasn\u2019t worth it) - to those of you who haven\u2019t experienced those type of drs - be grateful - it isn\u2019t pretty and it feels really wrong.   After moms stroke - she mostly slept - her eyes stayed closed but she answered everything with thumbs up and thumbs down in the ICU - And I mean everything from \u201cdid you pay your health insurance\u201d to \u201cis this the correct password for your computer and accounts\u201d - she thumbs up and down and was correct on every one of them - my mom was 71 - lived on her own - ran a business and even though she was hooked to machines and couldn\u2019t talk or eat - and slept a lot she still comprehended every question - after her brain swelling went down and she was finally in the clear - the Neuro took me aside and said \u201chere is your moms scan - it was a large stroke and your saying she was independent so though she will most likely talk again - swallow and eat and probably walk she will have cognitive disabilities and won\u2019t like her life \u201c she then said I wouldn\u2019t put the feeding tube in\u201d and go home with hospice. I asked more - I told her I would think about what she said and I would review her living will (I did listen to her - but it also made no sense) after she left I thought - \u201cshe told me she will walk and talk and eat and swallow and mom is answering every question I ask her correctly\u201d - this is only day 7/8 and I need to give my mom more time to heal - I read and researched stroke recovery etc (and had been learning for days while in ICU) then the next day told her - I wanted the feeding tube. The neuro and her \u201cundergrad followers\u201d stood outside my moms room telling me all the reason she didn\u2019t agree and how if it were her and blah blah then an hour or so later the case manager called me into her office to \u201cspeak With me\u201d about my decision (I asked my husband - my sister - moms sister and granddaughter - am I crazy? am I making the right choice - we all agreed mom would want this. So case manager was questioning me and I just handed them her living will - it said yes to feeding tube if for chance of recovery and that I was to make all choices. I totally do not want my mom to suffer with life saving measures but the sad part is \u201cI don\u2019t trust others to make those decisions\u201d for her. It does happen.

Mom felt awful when her pressure was low. Too high or too low is bad.   If she doesn\u2019t drink a lot try fruit jello yogurt lots of ice in juice. If she sips slowly the ice is melting and she\u2019s consuming more water. Personally I eat soup year round. Some people only like it in the winter. My mom went to the bathroom so much that she didn\u2019t want to drink a lot but they get dehydrated. I made smoothies for her with fruit yogurt and ice.
