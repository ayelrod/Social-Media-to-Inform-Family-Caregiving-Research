Not this grey winter that never ends and snow that goes into April. I'm starting to feel like I don't have anything left and I don't want to try anymore. I don't want to listen to my mother talking for hours anymore, I don't have the energy to work through all of her problems or issues anymore. I don't even know to where to start, I just want to sleep or stay in my room all day because it's the only place I get some silence.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>I had some energy when I got up today but she started talking and talking and talking and I could feel it all getting sucked away. Do people ever think that if you try to have a 'serious conversation' every single day with someone then after 5 or 10 years you are going to give it as much attention? The biggest part of taking care isn't managing her physical needs, it's her emotional ones. Every interaction she has with another person has to be analyzed. She thinks most people don't like her or are out to get her. She monologues about her childhood every day. She likes to tell me what I'm doing wrong or that I'm not really talking with her so this must mean I'm not a Christian. She has debilitating bouts of depression that make her irritable and negative. I ask her to be quiet for a while and she just keeps on talking. If I go somewhere without her, she acts depressed or like I'm going somewhere to talk about her.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>I want things to be easier and happier. My entire life has been spent around people who blow up when they are mad, hold onto the past and can't forgive and let go. I feel like she's trying to make me angry or get some sort of response out of me. I did stop confiding her a long time ago because when she gets mad she'd say anything to try to hurt you. I don't want to argue or try to explain anything and I dont to be 'talked at' for hours every day either.

{"post_id": "474034", "title": "Where would you run away to?", "body": "I have 1 daughter &amp; 1 step daughter who could both chew the ear off a brass monkey. I can't tolerate it really. When my DD was a child she didn't say a word until she was 3. The family (on my ex's side) were all so worried OMG there was something WRONG with her they'd say over and over again. I knew otherwise. When she turned 3 she started talking in sentences and hasn't shut up since; she's now 29. As a child I'd tell her 'I need 5 minutes of silence now dear.' That was the rule; we'd start out with 5 minutes of silence and work our way up to 10 and 15 from there. It was while driving I'd ask for the silence b/c it'd drive me up the WALL to hear her constant chatter while trying to focus on the road!   My step daughter now calls my husband and literally keeps him on the phone for 2 hours or more; I have no idea how he does it. It takes her longer to TELL a story than it took for the incident to HAPPEN!   So you want peace I understand that intimately. What I do not understand is why you are living with your mother who drives you insane? A child there's no choice about a mother there is. Using the \"you must not be a Christian b/c you're not doing things MY way\" BS against you is hitting below the belt. Having dramatic mood swings run-on monologues and the need to micro-analyze every personal interaction she has sounds like mental illness to me. Not to mention 'debilitating bouts of depression' and non-stop chatter. My mother was like this to a large degree which was one of the many reasons I could NEVER live with her again after childhood. Once was more than enough. She too could not have a moments silence while together; I believe she couldn't stand her own company and had to fill every moment with idle chatter just so there WASN'T a moment to THINK or to feel alone. That's my 2 cent psychology on the matter. My mother's mental illness was apparent since I was a very young child; I even kept a black &amp; white marble notebook about her 'episodes' so that I could present it to the 'men in the white coats' when they came to take her away so they'd have some history to go on. That never happened. Untreated/undiagnosed mental illness takes a huge toll on everyone but mostly on YOU the recipient of all of her wrath suspicions histrionics and runaway thoughts she can't seem to stop ruminating on.  You need a break. Yes it would be great to run away to some tropical island but that's not reality just a nice fantasy. Why not focus on what you can actually DO to get mom out of your living space NOW? Who cares if you send her off to the sibling &amp; they have a fight? Welcome to YOUR LIFE! Look into Assisted Living or Independent Senior Living or just an apartment for her OUT of your house (or you moving out of her house; whatever your living arrangement is). Other alternatives ARE available even if you think they're not. They are. Medicaid is available to finance Skilled Nursing if she qualifies. Section 8 housing is available even if it means you get her on a list now for sometime down the road. Even just getting the ball in motion can relieve your MIND of some of the burden it's hanging onto.   I don't have all the answers I just want to make you think about finding some yourself. Living like this with THIS type of mother invading your peace 24/7 is a terrible burden to bear. It has nothing to do with 'love' but with peace and with blessed silence that you deserve to have in your life. We all do. It's a human right I think that we take for granted until someone steps in and takes it away from us. Then we realize just how sacred it was!  Wishing you some joy &amp; peace in your life my friend and hoping you can find it somehow.", "date": "2022-04-06 14:34:50", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/where-would-you-run-away-to-474034.htm"},

It's like she has no awareness that I'm trying to do something else and cannot or do not want to listen to her at the moment. I've asked her how other people asked her quit talking in a way that did not hurt her feelings or what I should say when I need silence and her answer was 'I don't know but I know they were able to do it'. I don't have any respite providers my only sibling that lives in town hasn't talked to her or me in about a year. I'm almost too nervous to send her to my other sibling's house because I think she may end up saying or doing something that would cause a fight. She doesn't really have any tact or buildup in arguments she will say whatever comes to her mind and goes from 0 to 60 in about 3 seconds.  Yesterday was actually an ok day once I got home from work. It's just that I never know what I'm walking into she could be severely depressed from something she saw on the news she might be angry about something she could be just fine she could be ruminating on something from the past. She brings up the past so much I know just about all the stories by heart. She asks me what I'm going to do after she's dead and I feel like it's a trick question. Like she wants to know so she can pick it apart. I can't confide anything in her anymore because even if she doesn't intend to it's like she can't stop herself from using it against you at some point down the road.

{"post_id": "474131", "title": "Palliative care in the hospital rushed my sister's death.", "body": ["<p>My sister Diane was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in mid october. She went to a local hospital for treatment and was recommended to try radiation to shrink the tumor to open up her airway so she could breathe a little better. She knew that she didn't have a lot of time left but wished to die at home and not in the hospital. As she followed the recommended options from the staff for her care her goal became to get home and into hospice there. We were told that would be nearly impossible as her breathing was quickly deteriorating. As each new episode caused anxiety, she began having a fib episodes also and they made the decision one night to intubate her. She only agreed to a seven day window and if no improvements were made she wanted to be taken off and let her go. After the days went by, we were all really stunned at the speed in which this all occured as she was actually showing improvement and was to be released to home care prior to intubation occured. We were all very shocked by this developement and the reasons given for the decisions being made. We all gathered to say goodbye to her. The doctors extubated her and we were told once again that she would pass very quickly without the tube. We proceeded to watch her struggle to breathe for the next 30 hours on her own, mind you vital fluids were cut off and her oxygen was reduced to 3 percent! We watched as she slowly became corpse like in front of us. We all knew she was very sick but after we were told she would not be able to make it home to pass because she wouldn't be able to breathe long enough to make it past the parking lot. To do so seemed like total bs as we watched her struggle the whole time on extremely reduced oxygen and no vital fluids going in. This all has been extremely hard and frustrating as we all felt as though she had a few good days left that could have been spent at home but were discouraged by them that it was too dangerous based on her lack of oxygen. As she lasted over 30 hours breathing almost on her own the whole time it feels like they ultimately decided she was too sick and sped up the process dramatically. Could she have been taken home? With fluids and oxygen may she have had a few good days to spend? Should our request have been denied? She was laughing, eating, and vibrant prior to intubation and was being told she could go home. Was her a fib enough to justify massive sedation followed by oxygen depravation, loss of medications for anxiety and blood pressure control and removal of vital fluids?I really can't seem to process or justify what happened to her other than it felt completely wrong.

In any case with stage 4 lung cancer going on I think there are minute-by-minute medical decisions that are made depending on the situation at hand. It sounds like the doctors did what they could for your beloved sister but it was her time to transition when she did unfortunately.   Death often feels wrong; like the timing is off somehow and that maybe something else could have or should have been done to prolong life a bit more. We want to lash out and blame others too. I know I felt an incredible amount of anger when my mother died in late February although I couldn't direct it at anyone in particular b/c nobody did anything 'wrong'. Yet I still felt so ANGRY inside. It was mom's time to go certainly and I knew that in my heart yet she took to her bed one day w/o warning and became semi-comatose just like that. So I wasn't really able to say 'goodbye' to her while she was awake/coherent. I think that was part of why I was so angry; I wanted that chance to say goodbye to her on MY terms and didn't get it.

The two who live in town come in 2-3 hours a week to help with cooking meals for mom.

I take care of my mom M-W from 5pm after work to until she goes to sleep at 9pm, then I wake up every 3 hours throughout the night to change her diapers and put her back to sleep. My mom was the kindest and sweetest human any child could ever wish for - Im shocked because I thought my siblings will take care of mom and let me live my life to the fullest as they did when I was their age. I tried giving up mom and saying I will move out and I\u2019m leaving mom to you, they didn\u2019t budge and when I attempted to go on vacation for a week I cut my vacation short because my two sisters refused to give up their sleep at night and take care of mom so mom ended up with a UTI for being left on full diaper until the caregiver came home next day.

Everyone gets frustrated with the situation. Not being able to communicate with that special person the way we use to and would love to do so again. The condition our loved ones are in unfortunately is not going to get any better. It will help to realize that and ACCEPT WHAT YOU CAN NOT CHANGE. Reality is that 'Hope' it will change is a lot of wasted energy and you'll eventually realize it or it will drive up a wall worrying and thinking about it. Once I over came the 'Shock Factor' of what is happening and it is a shock to our systems as we've never delt with it before. It helped me a lot just to realize talking to my wonderful Mother and using REASON AND LOGIC is just not something that's ever going to happen again. Oh sure she has her moments but that's all it is a moment.  I for one will not put my Mother in an assisted living place. Just not going to happen. I'll bring in whatever I need in to allow her to live out her day in her Nest period. When memory goes the only great thing about it to me is whatever drama that arises day to day --- why should I let it bother me? Mother won't remember what happened in 6 hours much less in the morning. Mom's frustration is in the morning is she still has the emotional feelings and doesn't understand why. So I get her in the car and drive around a while just to get her outside her 'CONFORT ZONE' get her outside in the sun. If I leave her inside all day it get to me normal. That ain't good for her or me. So I get her out get an ice cream cone. This afternoon I'm taking her to the Dallas Arboretum. She hates not being able to walk without a stroller. Being pushed in a wheel chair she hates worse but once out she is glad to be out. I found a nice cleaning lady that delt with this same situation with her Mother. I pay her to take all day cleaning and talking to Mom while I go play golf. Mom gets upset when I tell her Lorie is coming today. I know what's coming. ----- I don't want her here today. I totally ignore the statement. I'll even leave the room when she starts talking. Got to go to the bathroom Mom. Come back for 15 minutes with some ice cream and hand it to her. Just FYI I mix little milk with Natural Vanilla Bean Ice Cream soon as she sees it whatever was on her mind goes away. If it doesn't Oh Mom we'll talk about that later enjoy and I'll leave the room. I have to treat Mom like a 6 year old child sometimes. Don't take this wrong but my sanity is much MUCH more important to the overall well being of this situation than is my Mothers as I'm the one dealing with it. Besides she won't remember after ice cream much less tomorrow. --- This is not how is my Mother coping with what is happening to her for that answer is Badly so what's your point. She won't remember tomorrow. My job is to just keep her frustration and stress levels to a minimum nothing else. If I can do that things run fairly smooth 80% of the time.  I've come to grips with the fact that I can't confide in Mom any longer. Can't ask - don't ask advice like I use to. Don't share what's happening in my daily life with her like I use to for she'll go off into outer space and deliver a retort that leaves me laughing. So I don't go there. You should not either.

No. Are siblings obligated to be your backup for days off holidays sickness or stress? No.   Of course it would be great if they offered more but just as you are all individuals all have your own lives partners kids jobs hobbies - you are all adults &amp; get to choose for yourself. They may have decided they can do no extra.   Yet you need extra help.   This is when you change your mind - change your thinking. From looking to *sibs* to help you to; 1. What extra help do I need? 2. How can I find this help? 3. Are there the funds? (ie does Mom have the $) 3. Is it possible?  There comes a time when many caregivers must reassess their plan. Is it still working? If not can it work with more help? Or has Mom's needs exceeded what can be done in a home setting? (Due to exhaustion lack of extra helpers or finances for aides).  Spend no more time wishing for siblings to be the work horses you need. You have strength &amp; courage. You CAN change the situation &amp; make it work better.

Before bed I prepared a pull up diaper and put in TWO additional insert pads in the middle of the pull up for extra absorbency then I helped my mom put them on. I had a large underpad over the bed to protect the bed in case she soaks through the diaper and pads and clothes. And she often did.   I changed her the next morning. I put her on the toilet and washed her very well front and back with soap and warm water using a squirt bottle (for postpartum use). She never developed UTI from being in the same diaper overnight. She did get UTI several times however but those were all because she went #2 in her diaper and I forgot to give her prune juice/pill afterwards to prevent UTI.

{"post_id": "473532", "title": "I\u2019m only venting. No question. Stress. Worry. Sister in hospital.", "body": "UPDATE  :) Dear all  THANK YOU for your support in a very difficult time for me.  You let me vent and you gave me warnings and support!!  My sister is on her way home now after about 1 week in hospital!! :) :) :)  I want to add some details below in case it helps someone in the future. Of course every case is different. \u2014\u2014  1. It was a good idea I refused anesthesia. I also refused invasive (stomach) testing. No point. My sister is elderly. Only risky. And even if they discover something we\u2019ll never operate.  2. Our urologist (not from hospital) (I was in constant contact) was right!! \u201cMaybe stomach ulcer\u201d (hospital doesn\u2019t know if there was an ulcer; we didn\u2019t do the invasive test to check) went away after calm. Our urologist said: he believes she never had an ulcer before the hospital and it suddenly appeared after hospitalization (due to stress of hospital stress from UTI + strong hospital medicine) (that was my initial instinct too).  Please be careful when you decide whether LO should go to hospital. There are risks. Sometimes there\u2019s no choice and you must go to the hospital.  We could have gotten our private urologist to see my sister at home treat at home. (Sometimes possible; depends how bad the situation is).  I didn\u2019t decide to bring my sister to the hospital. I was not home in that moment. The caregiver made the decision. The caregiver is a lovely competent person. We have agreed however that from now on my sister will not go to the hospital again without my consent (caregiver will call me). (Exception: falling possible broken bones ok to go to hospital without my consent).  3. My sister has always had some anemia (but every doctor has said it\u2019s OK). It\u2019s possible hospital decided unnecessarily to treat the anemia.  4. I have POA. My sister wants me to make decisions under some circumstances. The hospital doctors know. Next time they\u2019ll always ask my permission.  5. My sister was given blood transfusion against \u201cmaybe ulcer bleeding\u201d without my consent. That\u2019ll never happen again. (Day after being hospitalized she suddenly had bloody black stools. But then bleeding stopped some days later.)  6. UTI fine. They fixed it.   7. Blood transfusion:  please be careful before you accept.  Sometimes necessary to save life (then personal choice or religious if you want; if your family wants).  Sometimes not necessary (like my sister). It only adds more risk. My sister is full of energy healthy very good blood. Be careful before you agree to accept someone else\u2019s blood.  Anemia can be treated in many ways (blood transfusion not always necessary).  Ulcer bleedings can stop on their own (our urologist was right: he knows my sister\u2019s medical history well. He said this is from hospital stress medicine etc. It will stop on its own).  Please do research on blood transfusions: they are often over-used in hospitals (I\u2019m not talking about when you\u2019re in an accident bleeding).  8. Goooood luck everyone!!!!! My sister is very lucky. She\u2019s OK!!!  9. This is our personal decision: we will never accept blood transfusion for anemia. We will always look for alternative treatment. It\u2019s a personal choice. My sister doesn\u2019t want blood transfusion against anemia (they gave her blood but she was unfit/unwell to make a decision. She was in a daze/incoherent/confused. Hospital as said admits they should have asked me.)  Our bodies create new blood every 4 months. Then the donor blood in my sister\u2019s body will be replaced by her own new blood. Good.  10. My sister is soooo happy to be home. This ended very well.  11. Our private urologist comes to the house tomorrow to check.  12. Our private cardiologist comes to the house also to check all the results and try to reduce all the medicines back to how it was before hospital. (My sister only had 1 little pill 3 times a week).

One tends to summarize and not all facts are presented.  Here more facts:  I have POA. I\u2019m the brother.  My sister was in good health.   My sister doesn\u2019t have dementia.  In hospital - right now - not good for her to make decisions. Doctors agreed.   Doctor agreed they should have asked me. (I\u2019m not just family I\u2019m POA).  It\u2019s not that important to me that they didn\u2019t ask my permission. I know they did what they think is best:  give blood transfusion.  It appears now that blood transfusion was necessary.

It\u2019s also possible it was caused by stress and strong medications in hospital. Our urologist (he\u2019s not from the hospital) said this now.  It\u2019s also possible there is no ulcer.  We won\u2019t do invasive testing/anesthesia. Too risky. And even if test says ulcer: we won\u2019t operate. Too risky. So no point to test. Our urologist agrees.

{"post_id": "473532", "title": "I\u2019m only venting. No question. Stress. Worry. Sister in hospital.", "body": "UTIs if not treated can cause sepsis. The person also has Dementia like symptoms. I bet there was some dehydration too. This also will cause Dementia type symptoms.  Alva's the nurse so she will say if I am right or wrong. Anemia and stomach ulcers do not happen because of a couple of days in the hospital. These problems were before her stay and found when she entered the hospital. As explained if the ulcers were bleeding then your sister was losing blood the reason for the transfusions. Your sister should have been showing some signs. Like thinking it was stomach upset or heartburn. If she has ulcers she needs to watch her diet. No hot and spicy foods. No foods with high acid content. Before she leaves the hospital ask for a diet plan. If these ulcers don't heal she will be back in the hospital. Over the counter meds will not help.   You keep saying sister is elderly. I am 72 and do not consider myself elderly. If your sister is passed 80 she may start having health problems she did not have before. The UTI can be kept at bay by using cranberry tablets and a probiotic. Alva swears by D-Mannose. Because she may have ulcers I would check with her doctor if safe to use what I have suggested. She should be drinking plenty of water. When she uses the bathroom she should use wipes to clean herself well after toilet paper. I like Huggies. No soap near the urethra. Cotton panties because they breath.   As long as your sister is competent to make decisions a doctor does not need to talk to you. Even if you have medical POA if she is competent doctors don't need to talk to you. She can have you put on HIPPA paperwork or verbally say its OK to talk to you. HIPPA keeps doctors and nurses from being able to say more than \"she's comfortable\" or \"shes had a good day\". Patients have a right to privacy when it comes to their health. You as a sister gives you no legal rights. If you do not already have POA I would get it and have it immediate meaning it starts as soon as your sister signs it. This does not mean you make her decisions if she is competent just means you don't need a declaration of incompetence from a doctor if for any reason she is incompetent. Really the doctor does not have to discuss anything with family if your sister is competent to make informed decisions. It was a courtesy that he did so.   My daughter is an RN who worked in rehab/NH facilities. She had a Dementia patient that had only a sister who came to visit. Since the patient had Dementia she couldn't sign a HIPPA form. Even so my daughter would tell the sister how the patient was doing and what was being done until one day when the sister started ranting and raving about a bandaid that had been put on the patients hand for a skin tear. No one had called her. No they wouldn't because she had no POA or was she on the HIPPA form as a contact. My daughter could not calm her down and eventually had to be curt and tell the woman that she was lucky that my daughter had told her anything. What I am trying to say is just because your family you have no rights to your sisters health information if she is considered competent to make informed decisions. Your opinion is not relevent. You sister has the final say. Its between her and the doctor how her health is handled. Your sister can ask that you be present for any consults. This gives you the opportunity to ask questions. You can talk it over with ur sister but she has the final say. Which is the way it should be.   I will say this won't be the last time your sister will be hospitalized. These stays will be a lot easier if you understand the system. Be glad that a Doctor comes out and talks to you he doesn't have to.   Hope there r no more hospital visits and her healthcare can be handled by her PCP.

I'm curious why is your sister not able to speak for herself about what treatments or tests she wants?  Your sister must have consented to the transfusion right?  When my mother reached the age of 90 had had a stroke a broken hip and been diagnosed with vascular dementia we realized that there were no \"good\" solutions to her increasingly complex medical issues.  Is your sister very elderly and confused about her health? If she is in good health and doesn't have dementia and presents with a possible ulcer and internal blood loss I would certainly want an endoscopy done (under a local) to see if there is a bleeding ulcer. I'd also want to test for H. Pylori. I'd want a stool sample to test for occult blood.  Sometimes blood loss like your sister's is life-threatening and there is not the luxury to wait for the patient to take supplements and eat better. A transfusion absent other contraindications gives immediately relief and gives the docs time to figure out what is happening.  Please stick around and let us know how you AND you sister are doing tomorrow.", "date": "2022-03-09 22:05:51", "user_name": "BarbBrooklyn", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-only-venting-no-question-stress-worry-sister-in-hospital-473532.htm"},

But do know if you write on the Forum and don't want ANY advice you should likely write in your own diary to vent instead. Here you have people. People will react if you see what I mean. I hope your sister will get better. The two things she is suffering from are extremely common and can be caused by a multitude of things.  I hope you will put your trust in the doctors who are trained in care. I spent my career as a nurse and if I have learned one thing it is that \"a LITTLE knowledge can be a dangerous thing\" as the old adage goes.  Remember the doctor has many many years of training under his or her belt and a wealth of experience. That's why you are there. Is this the first illness your Sister has faced down? Or the first illness serious enough to be hospitalized? Are you her POA for health care or a person listed as her POA on an advance directive? May I ask how old your sister is? And how old you are? I was the POA and listed on advance directive for my brother. We were like Hansel and Gretel in the dark forests of life until his death. I understand the deep affection and loyalty you express and the worry.

It is Feast: True Love in and out of the Kitchen. I just finished Jamie Raskin's book Unthinkable about January 6th and about the suicide of his son. Highly recommend. A wonderful man who tries hard to see both sides. And what an education: For instance at 80 I never knew that until 1913 it was our Congress who elected our Senators not \"we the people\". Most profound from him is this quote which shows how differently we think in our country how divided we are: \"As the senaors exit and the House members resume their usual places I look to my left and see the Democrats and to my right I see the Republicans. I recall a conversations I have with a Republican colleague Rep. Clay Higgins of LA. once when we were sitting on the floor. 'What do you see when you look out over our side and then over your side'? I asked Clay who is a good- natured man with an awesome Cajun accent. \"He looked at me and said 'you tell me first'. 'When I look at our side' I said 'I see America today in all its glory; black white hispanic asian-American LGBTQ straight gay women men immigrants native-born. And when I look at your side I see America in the 50s.' (Clay replied) 'When I look at your side he said I see the Coasts New York and California. When I look at my side I see the heartland'. End of quote from this book. Really if we could just think and talk to the \"other side\" how much we could learn about the differences we all feel see believe. And how much more alike we might admit to be in our thinking than the rhetoric we are forced into when forced to \"choose\" those sides?

Her own brother, who is 95, and totally the opposite of her in terms of disposition and complaining has two daughters and a granddaughter who help with him They are going to Mexico for three weeks. Instead of complaining, he tells me how happy he is they can take a break as they do so much for him. Instead, my mom gripes, saying I need to call every day. I said part of the reason frankly I am leaving is not only the weather but to get away from her constant spewing of anxieties every day. I say call one of my other brothers. She said one lives 1000 miles away and one works full time. I say I cannot be helpful if I am in Florida or somewhere. I remind my mom how her brothers kids are going to Mexico for three weeks and Charlie is happy about that. She responds, but Charlies girls do so much for him otherwise, And I dont I though? One time at a holiday event she said, Kevin, look how much Charlie's girls do for him. One of those very girls scolded my mom saying, Jeannie, my dad has three people watching over him, you have ONE. You shoud appreciate that. Naturally it did not sink in.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>Last week it hit a head. I was on the phone with her forementioned brother while at her apartment trying to get information about the walker, hearing aids, etc he uses so I can help my mom more in what to choose. Then we chatted. She goes, I want you to hang up now. I said Uncle Charlie, my mom wants me to hang up, so we did. Then she yells at me why I told Uncle Charlie I needed to hang up, I should nothave said that. I said you should not have said that to begin with. She wonders why I cant alk to Charlie for ten minutes but not her. I said first of all I talk to Charlie once every three our four weeks so there is more to talk about, unlike two or three times a day but also, I added, Charlie is pleasant to talk to, she is not. I and I pointed out that her demand I hang up NOW is an example of how unpleasant she is to be with</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>Anyway, dont know what to do anymore.

{"post_id": "473079", "title": "Doing better with boundaries but not with consequences.", "body": "Consequences: refuse to take her any place the van goes to; if she needs to go to those places let her work it out. Tell her you won't be calling during your vacation; and stick to it. Your mother is safe and well cared for; she is entitled to nothing further from you. Anything she gets from you is a privilege not an entitlement. If she is rude and/or demanding during face and phone conversations tell her you won't keep talking with her on those terms and leave/hang up. When you start implementing consequences be prepared that she will ramp up/accelerate the whining complaining shaming and guilt. Stick to your script. It will eventually lessen some of her behaviors. And you really should consider your mother's narcissistic behavior (for example you admit you are the 'whipping post'-another word for scapegoat. By letting her constantly treat you badly without repercussions is 'enabling'). (I refused to talk to or see my own 88 year old mother for over 8 months due to her very vicious mouth etc. This absence sent a very clear message to her that if she expected me to be around when she really needed help she would have to behave more civilly. I'm not suggesting something this drastic for you its simply by way of example of a 'consequence'. And the absence did work to some extent; she started reigning in her worse behaviors.) Bottom line: boundaries only work if you implement consequences. Make a list of your boundaries and next to each boundary write the consequence. Read your list every day. That is what I did. And it helped me retain some sanity in a very unsane relationship. Good luck; I sense you are a very kind and generous person and send many good feelings to you.", "date": "2022-03-19 14:36:05", "user_name": "stilldealing1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/doing-better-with-boundaries-but-not-with-consequences-473079.htm"},

{"post_id": "473805", "title": "Move where you want, not because of housing prices. Right?", "body": "I would never be in the camp of moving where you want regardless of costs to live there. I don't know when it started that people decided (to live on credit cards) to live the life they want; it's been prevalent at least the last 20 years.  I moved around a lot in my earlier years always living beneath my means or right at them b/c I had no choice. As I aged and my income increased I still lived beneath my means.   This offers a lot of opportunities. Freedoms. Less stress. I could change jobs if I wanted even if they offered less money. There came a time where I didn't have to sweat the big stuff when it rolled around (and big stuff is always right around the corner). Etc.  I'm not motivated by money but you need it. That said I tried to work jobs that gave me purpose or enjoyment whatever...but none offered a salary that you see these days. I never got above middle-middle class and then that was only because of a single job I held for 14 years and combined with my husband's income.  Now that I'm in my older years it's paid off in ways that end up very important yet in reality I hadn't considered them as such.   We bought a bit of a fixer-upper 20 years ago b/c it checked all the boxes of what we wanted and was purchased for less than what we were approved for .   Sunk a lot of CASH into the house; didn't even have a credit card then(!).  The 30-year mortgage was paid off in 14 years.  My credit score even without credit cards was 810 or 820. (My husband had the same mindset as me--live beneath your means--which made life a lot easier to navigate.) His credit score without credit cards was 820.  When we started buying new vehicles b/c we tired of used we got excellent interest rates. We were able to buy two new vehicles in one day b/c even though we weren't \"well off\" we had a nice discretionary income and stellar credit. (We'd both been able to buy two new vehicles we always wanted--another win!)  We didn't live a dull life b/c of our approach. He was a musician on the side--very expensive. We had Harleys (one at a time) and he was finally able to buy a brand new one; it was paid off a year early. And of course he was a guy so he had big-boy toys. None of it was a problem.  I'm now a widow and my income is waaay down but the house is paid off my expenses are covered. I don't have to stress about this or that getting shut off or bill collectors etc. And b/c I keep expenses down there is the occasional month that rolls around here and there where I'm actually able to put a few extra hundred dollars aside beyond what I put in my budget to save. (Though I've been known take a bit of that to the casino lol.)  It's less about saving more about living in a manner that allows you to live with less stress or worrying about the \"what-ifs.\" I'd rather have a nice little house than a \"better\" one I could lose b/c of the economy job loss death/divorce etc.  No matter how much money the average working person makes they're only a paycheck away from potential disaster.

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge.

Some of us have small grandchildren we're tending.   And some of us are in our 70s or 80s tending elders in their 100s.  Not all of our parents have money. And not all of our parents are \"delightful\".  There are circumstances that lead to folks being angry.   Walk a mile in someone's shoes with a feces-smearing paranoid accusatory violent elder before you judge the desperation you see in these posts.  Or with a self-involved mentally ill mother who never gave her children a single thought but now expects them to dance attendence on them.  Or the in-law from heck who is moved in because the parentified child \"can\"t bear\" to see mummy in a home but asks the spouse to give up her/his life snd livelihood to enable a charade of independence.  Don't judge us based on your \"delightful\" experience.", "date": "2022-02-11 15:51:09", "user_name": "BarbBrooklyn", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-anger-breaks-my-heart-473003.htm"},

Testing means nothing because a person can text positive one day and negative the next day. I am sorry people have died from covid but that is not an excuse for all the fear porn we are being hit with on a daily basis.   Not to mention the media spin on children who had covid and were hospitalized who the CDC now admits that almost all of these children were hospitalized for something else and then tested positive for covid.  Covid treatment protocols in hospitals are killing people with remsidiver being a 50% killer. Then add in the vent and you see that percentage increase.   Never before have we seen so much propaganda surrounding a vaccine that does not seem to be protecting anyone from getting or spreading covid. A covid test that they now are creating new rules for asymptomatic people after telling us the opposite for 2 years. Just look at current protocols for quarantine to see there is no science behind any of it. Just dollar signs.  Vaccine manufacturers have no liability for deaths or injuries related to these vaccines so they are churning out even a booster for omicron tjat is supposed to be ready by March. Even though omnicron is not a lethal strain of covid. Why? Because there is billions to be made. In the mean time the media blackout on deaths and injuries from the vaccine is a disgusting breach of ethics.   Where is the public outrage for even one death because of the vaccine? Why is that acceptable but one death from covid isn't? Covid is not preventable as we see people who have been masking social distancing getting vacmccines and boosters still contraching it. Both vaxxed and unvaxxed have a 98% recovery rate.   Those with long haul covid may want to research the medications they were given to see if just maybe those are the cause of their long haul covid and not covid itself.

She caught it in a rehab hospital not in her place. She was isolated for two weeks after returning from the rehab place then on her last day of isolation she tested positive and was quarantined for another three weeks.  They did have an outbreak in her MC five months before Mom had it and they did a good job of containing it. A couple of residents did die but they were also in very bad shape already so I wasn't surprised.  However I saw my mother in person on March 14 2020 and didn't get to hug her again until March 20 2021. (I did get to hold her hand when they sent her to the ER once in October 2020.) She couldn't see me through the window when I visited and she wasn't good on the phone although I called frequently anyway.   That isolation did real damage to her and to all the other residents especially because MC residents have no idea what Covid is. It damaged relationships as my mother wasn't totally clear on who I was once I was able to see her again. I had put her on hospice care when she came back from the rehab place and the hospice nurse let me come to assist her with Mom's wound care so I was able to come into the MC when other family members still couldn't visit in person. I'm immensely grateful for that time with my mom but I also resent that lost year that led to such confusion for her and accelerated her memory decline.  I didn't know any family members at that place who supported such draconian measures but I also don't know if they could have done anything else. This time around though I think they need to tread carefully and make sure people aren't unnecessarily separated from their loved ones. It's very difficult to get a test around here and there are spouses who visit every day. I'm not sure that requiring a test every time is realistic or fair.

It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him.

I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave.

Thankfully she had her Jitterbug on her and a woman driving by was able to find the emergency number and call me and 911!   In the end Mom was fine other than bruised ribs and ego. My brother and I made the decision to have her cease all driving. The condition was that in order for her to continue living with me she would have to agree to give up driving. She reluctantly agreed. She still complained she can\u2019t drive and even after her Alz diagnosis\u2026.still states she\u2019s fine and has no memory issues. Sometimes tough love needs to happen.

I have news for you, that is not the case for anyone I know. Everyone I know that is my age HATES doctors and the entire medical profession because they have been lied to, treated like they are stupid, patronized, misdiagnosed, overcharged, and just generally treated like they don't matter. I know that my recent battle with COVID has convinced me that not one person out there in the so-called \"medical profession\" has any idea what they are doing. I, for one, am just not going to put up with it. If I die, I die, but I am not going to be told to my face that I am stupid because I won't take their nonsensical advice. As a 4F patient (Female, Fat, Fertile, Over Fifty), every doctor treats you like a hypochondriac or some raging idiot. Imagine if you will, having a \"medical professional\" tell you to just take a treatment that you are allergic to and just \"deal with the side effects\". Yup, you guessed it, I was told to just take the stupid vaccine just because they are demanding it and I could just be damned because I was allergic to it. This is no different than telling someone with a peanut allergy to take a bite of that PBJ when they are hungry and \"just deal with it\". I consider this irresponsible bordering on criminal. I have also had a doctor tell me that I broke my ankle (tripping over a garden hose of all things) because I was overweight. Really? Exactly how does that work in your little pea brain? Was I supposed to be dancing in the garden instead of carrying a bag of fertilizer?</p>", "<p>And all because, at best, their big pharma-loving parent companies tell them what to think and how to practice medicine. At worst, they are lazy and stupid. I can not tell you how much I hate the entire medical profession. They treat all of us old people like we are just expendable and should just get on with dying. My response to that is not something I can say in polite company.

No one else is going to step up. They rely on you doing it all and not acknowledging you're doing it assuages their guilt for doing nothing.  I can't stress this enough. I'd address it with them.

You are right about the rehab would have done something if you pushed her. That kind of behavior doesn't fly in a care facility. If you want to cut all ties with your family then that is what you will do. Please have a meeting with them and talk first before you take this action. A lot of the manipulating and lying could be your mother's doing. She may very well have dementia and could seem perfectly fine to everyone. They're not though. Often when the dementia is in its early stages and the person is still highly functional they will fixate on someone and turn on them for no rhyme or reason. That person becomes as you say the \"villain\". They usually start by accusing the villain of stealing from them. Then the villain deprives them of food and starts hitting and shoving them. Often when actually with the \"villain\" they're nice as pie as if nothing ever happened. Especially if there are other people around. I've been in elder homecare for many years. In those years I have been the dementia \"villain\" many times. It's always a lie. I've been replaced on some assignments but never fired because an elder with dementia showtimed so well that it was believable. I remember with distinction one client who accused me of the most heinous behavior. She had dementia but seemed very lucid and together. She was still highly functional too and lived alone. Her family had cameras all over the house and I was watched and heard every minute so they knew nothing was going on.  Your situation might be like this too. How about talk to your family and see what's up. Maybe it's not them. Don't become your mother's caregiver if she goes home though. Let your family figure out what to do with her not you.

[2:18:16 pm]:\u00a0XXXXX\u00a0I want to know what I have to do to stop him from changing insurance companies over and over again.\u00a0He does have dementia. He's had at least two strokes. He doesn't always know what he's doing. His insurance hopping is caused by the TV ads that say to CALL NOW to get something free. This causes a mess with his doctors medications and his adult foster home.\u00a0So before he looses something he needs I'd like to know what I have to do to stop him.

I have tried to express my feelings to her but have learned it does no good so I just clam up and stop talking to her. Sadly I don't enjoy her company so work at distancing myself from her mentally emotionally and spiritually. It feels like the only way to save myself but fear I may become an empty shell.  As a young girl I was not necesarily close to her - I now am getting a clearer picture of why.  You are not a selfish person. The feelings we have towards our mothers are not comfortable so I think we try to push them down because they make us feel guilty and selfish. I was once told that guilt is resentment turned inward. There may be some truth to that.  Do what you can to be true to yourself. Do what you can to have whatever relationship with your mother that works for you. One of my worries is that when mom is gone I will feel guilty for any unkind ways I treated her.

She has a problem with everyone yet needs to be in the center of attention and typically gets there by being nasty confrontational and provocative. I grew up with her constantly not speaking to me unless I was doing something that made her feel good about herself. As I result I suffered trauma and have anxiety to this day at 53. I have kids of my own and a loving husband. When my Dad died 5 years ago she became even more awful with verbal abuse always seeking attention at others expense. Despite the abuse directed at me I have stood by her due to guilt and it has caused me a lot of angst. Now she is exhibiting signs of dementia she is drinking too much and she is full of hateful speech. I live in complete fear that I am going to end up taking care of her and being exposed to her nastiness on a daily basis. Her words still cut right through me.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "My mom has been a miserable, nasty, and hateful person all her life. As a mother she has dominated every aspect of her children's life.", "body": "I am also guilt ridden about my dad. He has dementia and had health issues and he lived with me for 4 months while i helped to get his health stable. I had to go part time from full time work in order to care for him. It was my intention to keep him with me but he has since had a leg amputation due to a diabetic foot wound. His dementia and his amputation together has made it impossible for me to care for him and run my business and care for my kids. I just can't be everywhere and do everything. My dad has always been a loner (not particularly family oriented) controlling critical and demanding. He went into a rehab facility that is about 20 min away from me after his amputation and I have decided to transition him to the nursing home side of the facility. He now calls and emails me constantly to come and get him out of there. He says he feels anxious when I'm not around and he wants home cooked meals and to stay at my house. At first I jumped at every call because I feel guilty not having him here. But I started to just get more resentful and exhausted and my kids and work had to take a backseat to his needs. I was visiting every weekend and/or bringing him to my house every weekend. But now I don't jump every time he calls and I go about every 2- weeks. I have constant guilt because I know it's not his fault that he has dementia and he feels frustrated to only have one leg. The guilt is always nagging away at me. But I do have to say that my life has simplified somewhat and I know that my dad is safe and well care for where he is. I think you have to think about YOU and your kids and your sanity! You can't continue to futilely try to please or appease her. You can call her now and then send a gift send flowers write her a personal note. But you don't have to have her at your home and be \"tortured\" anymore! That's not your duty or your obligation.

I am the only remaining child of parents who were abusive to both me and my now deceased older brother. I would recommend that you look at the work of Alice Miller The Body Never Forgets and The Drama of the Gifted Child--there are others titles too. Your depression may be caused by early memories and experiences and hurtfulness in growing up with an intolerable person. I have two parents who are 98 and 97 who live at home with a part-time caretaker. This holiday I am spending with loving and kind friends and family--I need a mental health break away from the toxicity of their home. You are not alone--put the guilt in a package place it on a boat and sail it down a river--say good-bye and fill your life with goodness and grace--don't allow her to cause further harm to you and your children. Step away and take a break--she will be fine without you--she can do so much harm to your physical and mental health--protect your life and your health. I am 65 and am determined to live a stress-free guilt-free happy life and wish the same for you--find the motivation and determination to make it happen. It's hard work but you can do it--set yourself free.

Shortly after she passed my husband took a stroke- vascular dementia- and I am struggling to be the best I can be for him; somedays I just cant take the drooling garbled words and I feel awful saying thing like-\" I missed that try again\" Im trying to maintain his dignity treat him as a respected husband still love him discuss things as husbands and wives do..... Im loosing it.  Sometimes I wonder if the mom issues just knocked the stuffin's out of me and I have less to work with for him like tolerance-the drooling sends me out of my mind. I know better and I cant seem to work past it.   Ok so those are todays issues but for you that are still dealing with mom or dad....please dont wait til their death put an end to this. If you carried what I carried Im suggesting you start now- the healing process- have something left over either for you or whatever else get brought your way.  She used to refer to me as the \"Blood clot that learned to walk and talk\". Or\" the worst miscarriage she ever had-she survived\". All those little terms of hers are silent now but not in my head. Still can hear them still remember when and where she would toss out those phrases.....and on days Im sinking caring for my husband.....here they come again..... Dont wait for the parents to pass-dont let their labels become who you are as I did. Cuz in my situation now granted Im not called a little b**** stupid b**** Gods garbage 24/7 like before yet when I cant seem to help my husband all that is loud and clear.   I will say this for the first time publicly-here and now- I am 64 yrs old and I have no true sense of who I am. Nothing. I live from sun up to sun down nothing in between. Im realizing now how over the years and demands became constant coudnt tell you the last movie I went to last time I danced used to decorate for holidays bake crochet curled my hair or put on make up- my nails are now short and unpolished refinished a piece of furniture....its all gone. As the years got worse I dropped pieces of me all over the roads traveled and today....there is nothing left to give up. Covid took the job-stroke took my husband; both I loved A LOT! Only time I leave the house is grocery's or doctor appointments.  Please read this and understand it doesnt end with the person ripping you up passing away.

It is Feast: True Love in and out of the Kitchen. I just finished Jamie Raskin's book Unthinkable about January 6th and about the suicide of his son. Highly recommend. A wonderful man who tries hard to see both sides. And what an education: For instance at 80 I never knew that until 1913 it was our Congress who elected our Senators not \"we the people\". Most profound from him is this quote which shows how differently we think in our country how divided we are: \"As the senaors exit and the House members resume their usual places I look to my left and see the Democrats and to my right I see the Republicans. I recall a conversations I have with a Republican colleague Rep. Clay Higgins of LA. once when we were sitting on the floor. 'What do you see when you look out over our side and then over your side'? I asked Clay who is a good- natured man with an awesome Cajun accent. \"He looked at me and said 'you tell me first'. 'When I look at our side' I said 'I see America today in all its glory; black white hispanic asian-American LGBTQ straight gay women men immigrants native-born. And when I look at your side I see America in the 50s.' (Clay replied) 'When I look at your side he said I see the Coasts New York and California. When I look at my side I see the heartland'. End of quote from this book. Really if we could just think and talk to the \"other side\" how much we could learn about the differences we all feel see believe.

This means that they can no longer be reached by phone, the calls immediately go to voice mail. In the past the fix was for me to drive across town to reset their phone. I've now figured out a great solution to the problem that allows their phones to be reset remotely either across town or across the country.</p>", "<p>I don't know if this will work on all phones, but it does work on more than one version of Panasonic cordless phones. To test if it will work on your phone, end a phone call without pressing OFF, this will put the phone in the unreachable state. Then unplug the base station phone from power, and after a few seconds plug it back in again. If this resets all the phone to working order then this solution will work for you.</p>", "<p>Knowing that the power reset fixes the problem, I realized there was a good solution. The solution is to plug the base station power into a smart plug. The smart plug that I had available was one from tp-link, while at my mother's house I used her wifi (yes, your parent will need to have a wifi connection) to configure the smart plug. I set up a dedicated account that I log into using the Kasa app from my phone, and from there it is very easy to turn the smart plug (and the phone plugged into it) off and then back on again. So now when I notice my mother's phone is unreachable, I log into the app and and reset her phone while sitting on my sofa at home. The Kasa app login can also be used by my sisters if they notice the problem before me.</p>", "<p>The app could also be programmed to reset the phone every night when your mother is sleeping (if configured in this way the reset would happen regardless of the state of the phone) so that her phone will be available to callers in the morning.</p>", "<p>I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but both my mother's have the problem so I think it's probably pretty common and the fix is so good that I wanted to share it.</p>"], "date": "2021-10-24 18:28:30", "user_name": "JorgeVerde", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Long-distance Caregiving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/wonderful-trick-to-remotely-reset-cordless-phone-of-parent-who-doesnt-press-off-button-470787.htm"},

Dawn007  I get where you're coming from about gaslighting in the medical profession. It's disgraceful. No family should ever have to make it their life's work to stay on top of everything in the care facility or hospital their loved one is in every moment of the day. Sadly we do have to because that's pretty much the healthcare system for the elderly and family has to do the advocating on behalf of their own. There has never been a nurse social worker or other healthcare professional who has ever gotten away with rolling an eye placating or making a snotty retort to me. When dealing with these people you can't get mad and lose your temper. I never do. I will have straight answers though. Or I will get the bit between my teeth and not let it go until someone loses a job. It's a shame what people have to do just to make sure their elderly are being decently cared for.

She had been deemed incompetent 2 years ago by doctors. Almost everytime i took her to the doctor she would act up. After several hours..security or police intervention i was told \u201c ok you can take your mom home now\u201d. Not enough support from doctors police family for caregivers of dementia patients with behaviors. Now my mom is drugged and sleeps in a wheelchair all day. That was courts and doctors solution. Just pitiful. Instead of helping me with her medications and some respite care. Instead i get the rolled eyes and snotty nurse retorts from her doctors. Thats gaslighting.", "date": "2021-12-13 09:19:59", "user_name": "Dawn007", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/lo-organized-crime-came-on-thursday-night-and-it-had-an-exquisite-sequence-471677.htm"},

Don't read if you care about spoilers.", "body": "polarbear  Feel free to borrow it any and every time you need it. Sometimes I have to add a bit of an explanation with it though. I couldn't tell you how many countless elders I've said this to. That they're not a burden because they need help around the house or with personal care or running errands like shopping or a doctor's appointment.  The \"burden\" is the narcissism. It's the assuming that the family will simply be \"voluntold\" that they are the old-age care plan. It's the expectation that family will simply accept their new life in nanny-slavery with joy in their hearts and smiles on their faces. It's the instigating and trouble making for sport. It's the endless complaining. It's the stubbornness that often crosses over to dangerous absurdity. It's the orneriness over nothing and the \"performances\" (such things as a totally unnecessary trip to the ER because to make sure you miss out on something you've been looking forward to). It's the sense of entitlement like the whole world owes them simply because they were lucky enough to not die young and were able to become elderly. It's the cheapness (even when they have money) and unwillingness to pay the actual price for what things cost. It's overdoing the neediness unnecessarily. Everyone here knows what I mean. So many seniors like children will behave as if they are incapable of the slightest independence and can't do anything for themselves. Not because they actually are but because they want to be catered to and waited upon by acting like helpless infants. Then they resent it when people treat them like helpless infants. When this behavior doesn't achieve the desired outcome they evolve to being a \"senior brat\" and a whole new kind of attention-seeking tantrums start up.  This is what makes our dear elderly loved ones a \"burden\".", "date": "2021-12-13 08:52:41", "user_name": "BurntCaregiver", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/lo-organized-crime-came-on-thursday-night-and-it-had-an-exquisite-sequence-471677.htm"},

Your mother is suffering from dementia and is having a pity party for herself. As such yes she's ruining your entire mood when you go visit her so you know in advance what to expect from her. What I do when I visit my mother who lives in Memory Care &amp; has advanced dementia is I bring distractions to keep her OFF of the complaining subjects she likes to dwell on. I bring my dog who likes to sit on her lap and I bring my cell phone which is filled with videos and photos of her great-grandson which she likes to look at. Even the ones she's seen before and has forgotten about. I'll even pull up photos on Facebook of her nieces and nephews if I run out of other things to keep her occupied. I also bring snacks which she likes a lot so that's another thing to keep her occupied for a short while.   Find uplifting things to talk about and do rather than depressing things that add to her already funky mood that's my suggestion. It's not easy having dementia and living in Memory Care with other elders suffering from dementia that's a fact!

{"post_id": "471635", "title": "Another visit gone south!", "body": "Mom's cover story of feeling miserable because she does not see family enough is common. But I also think it is incorrect. There are many people who hardly ever see their family or have no family at all &amp; yet they are happy. They find 'family' where they are.   I think what she means is she is lonely. Is not feeling connected to people around her. It's understandable.   I imagine making connections gets harder as we age especially when you add in hearing loss others people's quirks &amp; impairments too.   But talking about lack of family visits is a little close to a blame game imho. If only family came I would be happier.. so my unhappiness could be their fault...  The bottom line is Mom's happiness is her own responsibility (not her family's). Her happiness is actually based on her own thoughts.  The good news is she CAN change her thoughts (sometimes a Geri-Psychologist &amp;/or mood meds can assist with this).

Does your SO know how angry this makes you? If not you really need to have a serious discussion about it and what this entire scenario is doing to your mental health. He can tell his parents \"no sorry I'm not willing to give up my few precious days off. You'll have to hire an aide to come in on my SIL's days off\".   If he is unwilling to do that for whatever his reasons then you're going to have to make some tough decisions...stay with him and put up with this highly dysfunctional family or decide enough's enough and end the relationship. Neither choice is a good one I realize. But you can't force people to change; you can only change yourself.

SO just said we had prior plans to go out. This dinner btw was in early October and said sister had been here a full month LIVING WITH THEM. Certainly she had enough time during her free Saturdays and Sundays plus all evenings to socialize with this sister but instead chose to disregard that SO has a very difficult less lucrative highly physical job.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Move where you want, not because of housing prices. Right?", "body": "I would never be in the camp of moving where you want regardless of costs to live there. I don't know when it started that people decided (to live on credit cards) to live the life they want; it's been prevalent at least the last 20 years.  I moved around a lot in my earlier years always living beneath my means or right at them b/c I had no choice. As I aged and my income increased I still lived beneath my means.   This offers a lot of opportunities. Freedoms. Less stress. I could change jobs if I wanted even if they offered less money. There came a time where I didn't have to sweat the big stuff when it rolled around (and big stuff is always right around the corner). Etc.  I'm not motivated by money but you need it. That said I tried to work jobs that gave me purpose or enjoyment whatever...but none offered a salary that you see these days. I never got above middle-middle class and then that was only because of a single job I held for 14 years and combined with my husband's income.  Now that I'm in my older years it's paid off in ways that end up very important yet in reality I hadn't considered them as such.   We bought a bit of a fixer-upper 20 years ago b/c it checked all the boxes of what we wanted and was purchased for less than what we were approved for .   Sunk a lot of CASH into the house; didn't even have a credit card then(!).  The 30-year mortgage was paid off in 14 years.  My credit score even without credit cards was 810 or 820. (My husband had the same mindset as me--live beneath your means--which made life a lot easier to navigate.) His credit score without credit cards was 820.  When we started buying new vehicles b/c we tired of used we got excellent interest rates. We were able to buy two new vehicles in one day b/c even though we weren't \"well off\" we had a nice discretionary income and stellar credit. (We'd both been able to buy two new vehicles we always wanted--another win!)  We didn't live a dull life b/c of our approach. He was a musician on the side--very expensive. We had Harleys (one at a time) and he was finally able to buy a brand new one; it was paid off a year early. And of course he was a guy so he had big-boy toys. None of it was a problem.  I'm now a widow and my income is waaay down but the house is paid off my expenses are covered. I don't have to stress about this or that getting shut off or bill collectors etc. And b/c I keep expenses down there is the occasional month that rolls around here and there where I'm actually able to put a few extra hundred dollars aside beyond what I put in my budget to save. (Though I've been known take a bit of that to the casino lol.)  It's less about saving more about living in a manner that allows you to live with less stress or worrying about the \"what-ifs.\" I'd rather have a nice little house than a \"better\" one I could lose b/c of the economy job loss death/divorce etc.  No matter how much money the average working person makes they're only a paycheck away from potential disaster.

Aside from unforeseen unavoidable and \"bad luck\" events in some people's lives a main reason why receiving and giving care becomes a burden is because people are in denial and they don't plan and save. There are other factors like the cost of medical care and people who choose unhealthy habits but mostly many people just don't plan early enough.  My mom (the daughter of immigrants) was a single parent the entire time she was raising me (an RN who worked FT). She never received a penny of child support. YET she went on to own her own home (a humble home later in life and paid cash for it) owns her car has no other debt and lives comfortably on her savings. Because of clean living and the luck of the draw she is a very healthy 92-yr old. She has good financial means right now but if she has a profound medical issue she will burn through her savings pretty fast. Most people's life savings are used up in the last 18 months of their lives. At some point if she requires Medicaid so be it. This is what it's for (also funded by taxes).   Creating an adult care tax credit will require management by the government. Our large and inefficient government. Everyone else's taxes will go up to fund yet another program.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": ["<p>I'm a 36 year old, only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and, since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7, I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke, so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills, endless phone calls, mountains of paperwork, and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much, and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating. <br>Add to that, I'm really sick of being a caregiver already, and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week, came home for a week, went in for another week, and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother, but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that, but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her, and I feel bad about it. I apologized, but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same. <br>I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues, the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes, the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits, I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy, but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up, having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything, having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot.<br>I'm tired of being trapped in this house, not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule, and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion.<br>I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition, but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984, she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet, and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health, but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried, despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so. <br>The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to, because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings, at home with me. <br>So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own, who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt, crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

Home prices are high in San Francisco where I live. But it isn't only the homes. It is everything. The food especially. Haircuts I am certain cost more but to live here in the city and get the big salon costs most have to travel in from the burbs; add that to the cost.  I think for some--the lucky ones--we can decide where we want to live. For others I think there isn't a lot of choice.

I've experienced something so similar and this is what I've learnt:  1-NEVER FEEL GUILTY!   You are a good person and you're doing your best. To prove what I'm saying just look on how guilty you're feeling! This proves that you truly do care for your mom [and deep deep down perhaps you also love her. Just for the fact that she brought you to life.] And this is despite the fact that all she caused you in your life is abuse anguish and pain. Therefore you have nothing to feel guilty about the problem is all hers. Whatever you're doing is to be admired.  2-DON'T CUT OFF WITH HER SHE'S YOUR MOM - but do make sure to CREATE BOUNDARIES and to PROTECT YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY.  This can be accomplished by speaking to a smart person who can advise you when you should or shouldn't visit or bring home your mom. And perhaps a good therapist can teach you how to be totally indifferent and remain calm and happy at the times you are with her.  3-LIFE IS CREATED TO ENJOY AND AT THE SAME TIME LIFE IS FULL OF CHALLENGES. the good news is though that there is a perfect way to tackle each challenge. And when you overcome a challenge you become a better and healthier person. AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF LIFE!  Good luck to all of you!

Hindsight is always best. Placed in a care facility your mom would get the best from you - and look forward to seeing you - and you would get the best from your Mom. I am so sorry you quit your job. I take care of my Mom full time but I had enough years in to retire with a comfortable income. My Mom has dementia and requires almost full time care but I have my brother who always helps out and is very cognizant of what my Mom needs. What you are doing is just. too. much. for. one. person. My Aunt is my support person (she lives in Florida) took care of her husband until she had to place him in nursing home. He died from Alz and diabetes. While he was in the NH she went at lunch time to make sure he ate and then at dinner time. She never missed a day. She also went to support groups and learned a lot. She tells me every time I talk with her - Number One: Never feel bad or guilty about losing your patience or temper or what you say or yell. Number Two: You are doing the hardest job in the world. Number Three: You are doing more than what most people would do. Number Four: No one else has ANY idea how hard it is - unless they have done it too. I really know how you feel about taking care of your Mom and not putting her in a nursing home but you really do need to think/consider about prioritizing some of your needs ahead of hers - such as working and having enough to live on and for retirement. I did therapy via zoom (or something like that) with a therapist that is near-by so I could see her in person some day and I highly recommend you do the same. I am really concerned that this is going to destroy you/your life the way it is right now. I really am. I also had a thought that maybe an attorney could get the medicare etc. in place instead of you doing it. At least if attornies do this you could get a price and see if it is feasible.

I got a recommendation from the SW or CM at the hospital from mum's last admission. I went with Visiting Angels because they had a local office in my parents town and when I called a real live person answered the phone. When I left a VM a real live person the same one multiple times called me back. They have have been great. Yes we got very lucky with an excellent aide who had capacity to take us on as a regular. If this is what you want make this known from the beginning with the agency. We have 3 times per week aide the same one every time for 3 hours a day. She mops the high use areas cleans the bathroom heats the food and makes sandwiches for supper washes the dishes and does the laundry takes out trash and provides them with some outside company and conversation. It is working out very well. She will go buy groceries if needed or pick up take away food too. The cost is less than $30/hr and if your mother has funds it is money well spent. You have to be involved at first. I was in the home when they started I wrote out check lists bought the cleaning supplies and stocked the bathroom and kitchen etc. But once you get a reliable aide with common sense and some experience after a couple of weeks of check lists its smooth sailing. I would Highly recommend them. But do be there when the aides first start coming so you can show them what is expected where things are and give them the low down on the parent - the good the bad and what you really need and expect. So they are not doing things you dont value and you are not always looking over their shoulder. Every day won't be perfect a couple times I found the trash was not taken out or the cat box was not scooped but 90% of the time its been great. We had only one who just came in sat on the sofa and played on her phone while my dad watched TV and talked to himself. (I walked in on this) But she was just a fill in for one day. The regular aides have been great and if/when they can't show the agency calls me direct and they will staff it with someone if at all possible. And as needs increase we can increase the coverage so they can stay in their home as long as possible. And if the aide cancels or quits the agency finds a replacement to staff your needs.

When I was in my mid-40s their relationship significantly deteriorated and I had to constantly be the referee. It was a horrible position to be in. I swear I still have PTSD from the constant odd phone calls drama falls fights 911 calls. It went on for years. In my case my mom was the aggressor and my dad was beginning cognitive decline. There was also prescription drug abuse and alcohol use (not a good mix for 70 year olds). Anyway I eventually had to place my dad in memory care for his own safety. Mom refused to consider any other option (such as in-home care). It was chaos. I am an only child and there was no one else to step in. I thought my life was over.  I do believe placing my dad in memory care probably caused him to die earlier than he would have. To me the blame is on my mom for that. He died in 2019 after 3 years in the facility. Now I am stuck with her but through some good fortune I was able to get the house sold in 2020 and because of her alcohol relapses she ended up in ER/hospital/skilled nursing/assisted living. Unfortunately the physical &amp; occupational therapists have spent all of 2021 bringing her from wheelchair to rigid walker to rollator and now a cane. Last year at this time she was in a wheelchair in memory care babbling nonsense and now she is walking and wanting to live independently again.  I am not sure me or my marriage will survive another miraculous recovery on her part. I will be 55 in February. I have been stepping in and dealing with their sh*t since 2009.  I agree parents are absolutely not supposed to be like this. I never imagined either one of my parents would end up living a decade or possibly two in such a state. A middle-aged person should not have to sacrifice health career marriage happiness for unending years. This is not the way it was supposed to be. It's not like caring for a child.

{"post_id": "471281", "title": "Update to financial impacts of disease treatments...", "body": "A lot has happened since I last posted. My husband's. Neurologist started the wheels in motion for him to begin Onpattro I fusions. Working with a case worker from the drug manufacturer and the infusion center where he will receive treatments we found ou that 80% of the treatment costs will becovered by Medicare. Our supplemental insurance will cover the remaining 20%. There was a slight delay in the approval process. Those of you living outside of the U.S. most likely will shake your heads in disbelief but in the United States our health insurance payment system is totally dependent upon codes that insurance companies assign to various procedures and treatments. Hospitals and clinics may also use codes...but they are usually internal to their operations and differ from those of the insurance companies. And then there is the added complication that hospitals clinics and treatment centers may have separate agreements with insurance companies that place them in selective discount tiers that allow them to adjust payment fees for differing institutions. When a doctor writes an order for a treatment they must be sure to specify the appropriate billing code used by whatever insurance company covers the patient. Many people are employed to keep track of all of this. In our case the neurologist correctly identified the appropriate billing code on the initial order. We were told however that a subsequent note that was sent to the infusion center contained a different code. With all the hands that touch the communications it took a while to identify who had seen the first code who had seen the conflicting codes who needed to contact the neurologist to make the correction and then find out where in the process the first information needed to be canceled so the correct code was used. (Yes we definitely need to overhaul our healthcare system.) Husband will receive his first Onpattro infusion today. We also were referred to a cardiologist to determine if husband's heart is involved. We met with cardiologist last week. We found that in Colorado where we live there are not many doctors with experience diagnosing or treating amyloidosis. This cardiologist referred by our primary care physician has some training both from his residency and a short internship with an amyloidosis specialist. Because husband already had the genetic confirmation of the Val30Met gene mutation the cardiologist limited his initial visit to an EKG and vitals. He advised the test that would reveal cardiac amyloid deposition is a PYP scan. A radioactive injection that when exposed to another scan causes amyloid deposits to glow thus confirming presence in the heart. This test is scheduled for early January.  mMeanwhile my husband's symptoms have worsened. His weakness and fatigue keep him chair-bound and napping throughout the day. If he does something like taking out the trash his breathing is labored and he must rest afterward..When he eats he feels full very quickly. He is eating barely half of what he was two months ago And continues to lose weight. In the past two days he has noticed considerable loss of strength in his left leg from his knee to his foot. He fell the day before yesterday after trying to bend forward to pick up something. He was not injured. But he did reveal that this was not the first time he has fallen. (News to me.) The falls the weakness the reduction in eating all tell me that disease is progressing rapidly. The infusion can't come soon enough.  I will share how the infusion goes and how he tolerates the treatment.

As someone who is in a similar circumstance my first thought is to take care of your own health first. Immediately actually. I'm concerned about your eyes. Hire whatever help they need now so you can focus on yourself. Then when you're feeling better you can sit down and make a plan on how to best move forward.   I don't know your situation but things didn't improve for me until I told my siblings that I quit. We started working together as a family after that meltdown. It's amazing what can be accomplished if you have help and support from family. If not hire the help and support.  During a discussion we had with an elder care attorney she told us about someone she had on staff. I can't remember the woman's title but the employee would go into the home and evaluate the loved one and then make recommendations for care. She was like a geriatric social worker.   My husband and I have been held hostage for so many years I'm embarrassed to say because neither of us had the gumption to stand up for ourselves. As a result we've been caregivers for the three parents between us without help from family. Now I say \"Two down one to go.\" Dark humor forgive me. We've learned a lot in the past year and are doing much better but we still have challenging days.   Isthisrealyreal wrote \"Not being snarky you have been conditioned so thoroughly by your parents you actually believe that them getting what they want is more important then you.\" It took me so long just to understand this concept.

It took me 50 years of marriage to a covert narcissist to come to the conclusion that I could not teach him how to love by loving him. Quite to the contrary the more I loved him the worse he treated me. I was trained by my mother who was very similar to him so my whole life I have been destroyed by jealous people. The more they tortured me the more I needs validation so I threw myself into my work and my hobbies. As a result I became more successful which only made things worse. I waited the 50 years of marriage for my husband to \"get it\". And now he has Parkinson's and the perfect excuse to control everyone. He makes it look like he can not care for himself (I do not believe this is true). He started falling down the steps (due to abuse of painkillers I found out after the fact). As a result as a temporary solution I hired 24/7 caregivers (very expensive). I realized at that point if I accepted responsibility for him he still will never \"get it\" and I have sentenced myself to the rest of my life as his slave. I filed for divorce because he is going to keep caregivers refuses to go to Assisted Living until he uses up all his savings. At that point I realize his wife (me) would have to pay his expenses thus using up all my savings leaving me with nothing for when I can no longer care for myself. My kids see only the fake dad the perfect one making me look like the evil person. I have lost them we still see each other but it is very strained. My advice to you go no contact. She will destroy you. You deserve better. You will feel the weight is lifted off of you. Don't feel guilty. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about. Send cards and call. Don't go. It is easy to hang up (for the doorbell or any other excuse) and cards are no contact. Take care of YOU. Someone told me this is your only life it is not a dress rehearsal. That is very profound.

I'm 39 and like you I was extremely overwhelmed in the beginning of my caregiving journey. My mom passed last month and the finality of her being gone is a tough adjustment; but I would have continued my sacrifice just to have her here. I don't know if you believe in something higher than yourself but I advise that you pray and turn to the word whenever you are feeling stressed resentful angry etc etc. I also advise trying to seek counseling/therapy to help with coping mechanisms while this journey lasts. I had no counsel in the beginning and I was my only help. I cared for my mom from roughly 18-39 years of age and that story in itself is something made for a movie which I won't divulge right now as I'm trying to be brief. In addition to what most of your supporters have mentioned regarding seeking someone to give u a break every week or so if it's financially possible or applying for Medicaid so she can have home health aides with her during the day while you tend to your needs you must also focus on your health and well being. We are consumed when caring for our loved ones that we tend to neglect ourselves. I have had way too much experience with hospitals rehab facilities etc etc. The healthcare system is broken and changes must be made. If your parent requires 24/7 care and help the countless facilities I have experienced will cause a decline in their health. Thank God for his blessings over my strength and patience as I was there from sun up to sundown once I realized the care given is not present so I was pretty much an unpaid worker whenever she was hospitalized or in a facility. Places lack the number of staff needed to help and nurses are overwhelmed with too many patients and when you witness this for over 2 decades it's heartbreaking and the quality of care is nonexistent. If ever you need to talk about the nitty gritty when it pertains to ALL THINGS related to caregiving please reach out. I tended to all my mom's countless needs and as time progressed more issues arose so I was in charge of medication administration feeding tube care tracheostomy care you name it....I was even taught how to give her antibiotics via her pic line at home. I have learned so much that I would not mind sharing with you or anyone else for that matter. Please pray and try your best to love her through her illness.

They may have counselors who can help you with the paperwork too. I also got help through my church with an extra caregiver so I\u2019d have more respite time.

This has been a very valuable discussion for me as I'm sure for the original poster. My Mom is turning the corner on being 88 and just beginning to exhibit some memory issues and has incontinence issues. She's in excellent health otherwise. I've gotten her health POA and permissions to discuss her care with her GP Medicare etc. She agreed to do this so that I wouldn't have to deal with all that should she get sick. She lives by herself in a house built by her and my Dad. I moved long distance to live near her 6 years ago when my Dad passed away. My husband and I do lots of little things for her and we're happy to do it however she's beginning to let the house fall into disrepair. I had to have a talk with her to let her know that if she wanted to stay in her house she would need to get things fixed. She is financially well off so money is not the issue. I think she gets overwhelmed when there are too many things to take care of so she just ignores some things. I found a handyman to begin repairing and replacing some of the important things like getting one of her door locks replaced because it was broken. She reasons things away like this by saying she lives in a gated community and no one would be able to get in. Ugh! Her front door locks were oxidized and the key would no longer work so those are being replaced too. When I tried recently to get her to have other things fixed she said it was too much too fast. Big argument there so I let it go. I'm going to try again after Thanksgiving. Her memory issues worsened over the summer. It comes and goes. We live in an area where people live here 6 months out of the year (we call them snowbirds). Her friends are returning and she's as happy as a clam. She's been hacked three times and I worry that it's only a matter of time before it happens again and harm is done. (thankfully I caught all three in progress and averted the worst).  Problems with long and\u00a0short-term memory:\u00a0 1. forgetting that's she's already asked the a\u00a0question just\u00a05 minutes later repeats herself. Seems to come and go.\u00a0 2.Often reintroduces me to those I've known for several years. 3.Showed up a day early to pick up friends for dinner another day an hour early.\u00a0 4. Forgets that she's ordered something online or orders an excess of items.  5. Has several piles of mail around the house.  6. Can't keep up with her emails (I have access to that and clean out the spam for her)  7. It's hard for her to make phone calls for\u00a0things that need\u00a0taken care of or fixed. Gets confused as to who's who with vendors. 8. She has items that should have been returned a year ago sitting on her desk.  The list goes on and on. I try hard to help her with all of it but she's resistant and stubborn. The caregiving has barely begun and I'm already frustrated and angry. Thank you all for the advice!

It\u2019s been a bit like uncovering buried treasure. There were so many lovely shrubs and flowers just needing a bit of care.

The real and unexpected bonus for me though is the joy it\u2019s brought to the residents. Some of them were once keen gardeners who are now unable to get stuck in but who still enjoy a walk round the garden to see what\u2019s in bloom.

She was 85 yrs old when she came here to live in a home just 2 doors away from me. She just gave me the power to take over all her finances and keep the orderly running of her home. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. She was up and down in her health and my life became doctor visits taking her out to places she would enjoy and food shopping for her. I lost my own life completely. If the electric went out during a storm I worried. If we had a blizzard and couldn\u2019t get out I worried. Every minute of every day was thinking about her her bills that needed to be paid her medication refills her congestive heart failure problems her growing breast cancer her taking a shower just everything that a person needs in order to live comfortably. She was able to do so because I gave up everything for her. And I did resent her. She would not have done that for me. Now that she is passed - at age 95 (this past summer) I feel relieved but I am still stuck. I urge you to think about a facility that can care for her at her level of care. This is a situation that will eat you alive. I developed Non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 5 yrs into my caretaking and I know it was due to stress the first years of caring for her. I am still treating. I don\u2019t know how long I have as I am stage 3b and there are only 4 stages. My body could not take the stress of actually taking over someone else\u2019s life.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Might I make a few observations and suggestions.  1 - Your mom's care will be overwhelming if you are the only person caring for her 24/7/365. Burnout is inevitable if you do not get enough \"time off\" to meet your own health needs and social needs.  2 - While I admire your dedication to your mom and her care you are neglecting your own retirement. You need to secure your own financial state first and being with mom second. Nobody can secure your finances or retirement but you.  3 - Everything seems overwhelming. You need to sort out the issues and create a plan. Meeting with a social worker and a counsellor - even televideo meetings can help. The social worker can help you locate and access all the resources available for your situation. A counsellor can help you sort out the emotional overload and create a healthy plan for dealing with your mom.  4 - There are lots of ways that you can work get enough time off and help care for mom. You can not care for her 24/7/365 alone.   a - Ask for help from family friends community of faith and paid help. Some folks will be OK with sitting your mom for a few hours weekly. Others may be able to help with household tasks: housekeeping meals yardwork running errands...  b - if you can not get enough help to care for mom at home then it is time to look at outside resources. Adult Day Care is a Monday through Friday daytime option; they care for mom in a nursing home of private home while you work. Home health aides can also watch mom in your home while you work. Assisted living usually consists of having a private room or suite with home health aides that assist throughout the day. Full care is for those that need frequent care by others. Check to see if mom's insurance and finances will cover any of these services.   c - If mom doesn't have enough finances help her apply for Medicaid. Help her also apply for Medicare and any other public help. You can make an appointment with Social Service. It might help to review their websites and gather all documents needed. If your mom ends up in the hospital again ask social services to help you with these tasks.   d - If mom needs to use Medicaid for help she may be best served in a residential facility that takes Medicaid clients.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Oh goodness. I saw this in my email inbox and I knew that I had to come by and say something. My mom passed away last year. I am 39 years old. And I took care of my mom for 13 years. My mom was 75 much older than your mom but I took care of her from age 25-38. After my dad passed away I was her caregiver.   Listen sweetie. I said the same things as you about how I would never put her in a nursing home and how she didn't want to go anyway.   I miss my mom so much. I burst out crying yesterday because a memory came to me so vividly about her. But there is so much CLARITY now that she is gone. I love her to pieces but she would have been so much better off if at the age of 25 I put her in assistant living. Because at the time she was at least able to walk with a walker and in the beginning I only did things like laundry and cooking and standby assistance for showers. Gradually she got worse took a few falls messed up her back. Became bedridden during the last 6 years of her life.   I was her ONLY caregiver. She did have CNAs coming to bathe her 3 times a week which was helpful but even with that it was a burden. (Ask the doctor to order you this if she has Medicare she should be able to get CNAs to come bathe her). My mom was a fiery woman used to be very independent and always got her way. Very sweet though. She wasn't horrible I'm just saying she was a woman that knew what she wanted. It was... HARD. My brothers off in other states with their family. We had no family here. It was just me. I managed bills her pills her dressing Hoyer Lifts taking her to doctors appointments her dentures her voiding and bowel movements. The whole nine.   I still sometimes here a sound (probably my neighbors) that makes me think its her and I have an urge to jump up and run to see if she needs help. The PTSD-like crap will get to you. I don't even know if it's PTSD. It's something.   Look. I joined a gym and MADE time for myself when I was taking care of my mom. You have to. You HAVE to go on a walk or do yoga. You matter too.   But anyway.... I was saying before... that I have such clarity now. I would have done everything differently. And one thing that I learned... no matter how much your mom says she doesn't want to go to a nursing home the fact is she's just scared. Deep down any sensible human would choose a nursing home over putting burden on someone they love. But she isn't sensible. She's knocking pills out of your hand and she has had strokes. She's sick. So she can't think logically about the matter but you can.   You'd be able to visit your mom in a nursing home even take her out shopping or out to lunch sometimes come by and visit her and tell her about a new guy or job in your life. About your new yoga class. Have photos for her to look at. Grandkids for her to visit with. All these things I wish I could have done with my mom but can't because I never gave myself a life.

She seemed happy with his suggestions (let us call you an Uber we have a shopping trip scheduled Friday and you could go then etc.) and went back upstairs to her room. Then during the 2 pm staff change meeting when nobody was looking out the door she went and she drove away. She didn't have her phone of course.  Eight hours later and well after dark (she hasn't driven after dark in years) the police were just about to put a vulnerable adult alert out on Twitter with photos of her and the car. My husband was on the phone with adult child #2 filling him in (we didn't want him to find out when his friends said hey isn't that your grandma on Twitter?) when her residence called to say she had breezed back in thanks to a Good Samaritan who had guided her back from the grocery store. Where else she had been she can't say.  The next day I \"stole\" her car. It is in the garage in her house which she still owns. She asks after it wonders why I took it why I hate her etc. I've ordered the police report so with any luck seeing it in black and white will convince her it actually happened.", "date": "2021-12-09 09:18:26", "user_name": "Ambrianne", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/are-you-on-the-naughty-list-471582.htm"},

Neither you or your mother will win a argument when trying to reason with someone with dementia. His ability to reason is long gone as is the executive ability required to manage his life. Some of what is occurring is because he is no longer mentally competent to initiate actions or control himself. Given the constant fighting and the post-fight wandering your dad might need to be in a memory care or even a nursing home given his overall poor health.

And it cost $1200 to fix the garage door.  They won\u2019t touch him because of the massive health problems\u2014at least not without significant bloodshed. The only thing they\u2019ll do is throw him in an ambulance to be held at a hospital on a psych hold because he went nuts on the cops \u2014 and then I\u2019m called to take him back home. I tried to get him admitted to the psych ward officially \u2014 and the social worker agreed \u2014 but the doctor said it wasn\u2019t warranted because he\u2019s calm now.  It was literally better if the police hadn\u2019t been called because then I had to bring home an enraged man back to the same house and either leave my mom there with him stay there myself to ensure her safety or bring her to my home.  I suppose I could not have picked him up and left him there. I freely admit: I don\u2019t know how to do something like that to my own father. I didn\u2019t speak to him on the way home or for a week after until he apologized but clearly there were no lessons learned be it from the police or from how I handled it.

This level of care is why we\u2019ve discovered a subdural hematoma; a GIST tumor in his stomach that we had removed; a gall bladder mass that ended up being gall bladder cancer (also removed); a blockage in his carotid artery that now requires a vascular surgeon because an angioplasty was impossible; a mini stroke recently that now requires more neurology visits and that\u2019s in addition to his CHF vascular dementia stage 3 kidney disease COPD and more. It\u2019s really hard for me to treat him normally when he is clearly not \u201cnormal\u201d not that he was ever a \u201cnice guy\u201d before these problems.

To me its not so much \"misinformation\" as being \"misinformed\".   I will use Hospice as an example. How many times on this forum do we hear that Hospice killed a LO. That they would not let them eat gave them too much morphine. The problem I see here is that this person is either not involved in the constant care or Hospice is not giving family informed info. We all know feeding is stopped because the body is shutting down and feeding does more harm than good. I think its hard for some to get their head around that Hospice means the end. So they are looking for any excuse to why the LO died. They died because whatever health problem they had caused their death. If not today someday.  Now I am not saying there are not poorly run Hospice and and care facilities. You need to be an Advocate for your LO. Ask questions and question. You have a right to fire a Hospice and transfer to another care facility. My Mom was in LTC. I have recommended this place. Another person says they had a bad experience with the place.

I am so glad you returned to write us a \"for instance\".  I don't think it is fear mongering to say what a difficult thing it is for care facilities to accept clients who are having a difficult time with acting out. It must be recognized by all not just by old nurses like me that a facility that houses many elders in memory care units usually elders as roommates for one another with access to others has a difficult time with elders who are a danger to others physically or emotionally or cause fear for others. When this happens any good facility attempts to work with families and with doctors to come up with medications that will help. And yes therein lies the problem of finding a drug or a drug cocktail that WORKS. That is one that will calm the elder sooth the elder so that they can be more content BUT keeps the elder from going into a zombie-like state where they do not eat do not interact and are in danger of poor balance and falls. \"Zombie-like\" may be an unfortunate choice of wording but I admit to having used it because it does paint a picture. A picture I have unfortunately been witness to. Gives people an idea of what is to be avoided. It is a terrible question what to do in these instances. A question without a good answer in some circumstances despite a whole slough of medications available. It is hit or miss wait and see try and try again for the doctors who aren't there to assess affects and side effects.  This is a RARE circumstance; Most of our elders suffering from dementia don't have these problems. But being on forum for any amount of time we will find out that it does happen is a problem and is one that is difficult to address. Discussing all of this honestly and openly on Forum does no one any harm. It isn't fear mongering; any of us already HAS fear on board when we try to act in the best interests of our elders who cannot act for themselves anymore. Accusations of facilities not caring of their drugging patients into oblivion etc IS/would be harmful. I personally haven't seen that but I could have missed it. It is my feeling that most who work with elders love doing it; it is almost a vocation. The last thing they want is to participate in or witness abuse of an elder. But that's just my own experience as a nurse and as a person whose loved one was in a wonderful ALF. I am glad we came to what is certainly an issue if not THE issue for you. We can better discuss it than when we use nebulous words like \"fear-mongering\".

Doing everything for them is not a big issue for me though sometimes I find it irritating.   There are two distinct parts I just cannot stand.  (1) It\u2019s the dynamics of their awful angry relationship that affects me. It\u2019s just unbelievable to me that at 80 years of life with death up right ahead knowing one of them may not wake up tomorrow and that would not be surprising \u2014 this is how they want to spend what could be their last day of life. How sad for them\u2026and how pitiful for me to watch it firsthand.  (2) My dad is just mentally unfit. He\u2019s a well-educated MBA man who worked to the high ranks at a US conglomerate before retiring and he\u2019s deteriorated to making no sense and can\u2019t process what he hears be it in English or Korean. Can\u2019t hear that well and what he does hear he can\u2019t process. (They\u2019re concluding its vascular dementia but specifically not Alzheimer\u2019s which has been ruled out.) And everyone can see it EXCEPT HIM. He\u2019ll still actually tell me he knows better or he doesn\u2019t need the likes of me etc. unaware he can\u2019t do anything for himself.  Worse he creates more work for me having to undo these ridiculous scams he falls for \u2014 Cheaper Medicare! Better refinancing rates! Save money with solar! Free HBO! \u2014 and so forth. All the calls and paperwork I have to do for them doesn\u2019t anger me but when he MAKES trouble\u2026 I just get enraged. And he\u2019s not even apologetic; he says \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Call and cancel it and stop acting like you\u2019re doing something extraordinary!\u201d  Everything else meh \u2014 I\u2019ll live.

I take them out to social activities they like and my husband is a good sport about going with us.

{"post_id": "471606", "title": "Don\u2019t feel like doing this anymore.", "body": "@countrymouse you are correct. The situation I am in was indeed my choice and my decision. I moved them here because it was clear they couldn\u2019t manage their care anymore. Be it a sick dad or sick mom I can\u2019t live with the fact that either died without my having done all I could.   Contrary to what I make it sound like in my original post (1) they were not bad parents to me growing up all things considered; and (2) I actually don\u2019t regret moving them here to manage their care. Even doing everything for them is not altogether torture for me in that giving them a few full-time years of my life to ensure a comfortable ending is still worthwhile to me. I\u2019m lucky to be able to do that. I know that.  It\u2019s that they hate each other and live off this drama that kills me. It\u2019s that they have zero qualms about involving me in this drama of theirs letting \u2014 no demanding and forcing \u2014 their daughter witness the ugliness and misery they cause each other at the end of their lives that just\u2026rots me. It\u2019s truly like a black mold that just spreads and I hate it. That is what I feel \u201cparents\u201d shouldn\u2019t do. I hate that my parents do this and I hate that I let it get this close to us.   I have asked and begged to be left out of it. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care that my dad took off again or that they had a blowout fight but I do not want to be involved in that part. I don\u2019t want to know and if they can\u2019t handle their own tempers to ensure they live peacefully they should deal with the repercussions of that on their own too. I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m savage and callous - but they don\u2019t understand I really cannot operate like this.  I\u2019ve explained that my life and my relationship with my husband are so peaceful and zen BY CHOICE and that I can\u2019t deal with the constant animosity they bring into it. It causes chaos in my own household (because it affects me) and it causes me embarrassment that my parents are living out the end of their lives like this. My sister and I live petrified that I will turn out like this.  Because this part comes with the other parts I willingly manage and like you said it was my decision when I knew their relationship was not great when I moved them here (since they involved me in that part then too though in my defense I had no idea to what extent or frequency this happened!) I do regret my decision\u2026.now.

What I do dislike is anger and vitriol against someone who doesn't believe what we believe. I think some few (very RARE) posters are into us doing the \"Social Media Bout\" here on Forum. Or into \"changing hearts and minds\"; I don't like to see a question by some innocent OP turned into 132 answers overnight of a few on Forum who got drawn into arguing with one another trying to prove our own points while the OP disappears under the waves. Realistically I guess this IS social media so I should just \"leave it\" as we say to the dogs. What is it the young kids say today? \"It's all good\"? (I could argue THAT one. I think we are all adults. We're capable of making our own decisions for our own lives of giving our own opinions to OPs who ask for them. Then let the OP sort out what is of value to him or her personally and leave the rest. We have a lot of regulars on Forum. I think we are all good people. I think we would all help one another if we were neighbors.  For the most part I don't think that the admins should intervene. If someone is expressing suicidal ideation they should if someone is threatening others they should make a decision; or if someone is spreading blatant dangerous misinformation (as opposed to opinion) they have to look it over.  So if a post is in some way dangerous in your opinion click on the report button and let the admins decide. I trust them to do so. And do this RARELY; they have a life! As to differences of opinion?? We often don't even agree in our own families; why would be think we can agree on Forum? The OPs I think are for the most part very capable of separating the chaff from the wheat for their own specific cases. And so often we dispense really GOOD information that can make a difference for people. Perhaps sometimes we are baited because folks just love to watch a bar fight and the latest season of Ozark is already gobbled up.  I guess we just have to make our own choice once again. Jump in or leave it. I do agree with cwillie that it would be nice if the admins stepped in when a thread goes South to either move it to discussions or to stop comment. My fear is that because we find out someone doesn't vote for OUR guy (or gal) we will decide their opinion doesn't count; NOT good.

{"post_id": "473101", "title": "\"Tell only those who will support you.\"", "body": "I actually disagree with this. Here's my food for thought. As I tell all pick up what works and let the rest sit. There is a whole disagreement among psychologists about what is best for their patients. Many just sit and sit and listen and listen and support and support that \"These feelings are normal\" and \"And how does that FEEL\" and on and on endlessly. What the person seeking help has then is one more friend to listen to the litany. When we are troubled and get ourselves in habitual ways of reacting we follow the same endless paths that lead us nowhere. We count on these listening posts to reassure us that we are \"good\" and \"oh poor you\" and so on. Wonderful but doesn't really help us. We KNOW that but we keep doing it because it is \"comfortable\" and represents \"the known\". It gives a momentary relief. Stress on the momentary. Then there are the psychologists who tell you going in \"This is a partnership; you won't find me to be a silent partner who listens to repeats of the same tale over and over again; I WILL give you input in order to shake you up to rattle the thinking\".  That is the help I find useful. Where you leave the session feeling like you are a neat scrabble board with known words that just got thrown up in the air. A mess to sort through. To think about. To reconsider. Sure we need a friend to support us. Hopefully more than one. We don't always want or need input. And we should SAY so if that's what we are looking for. We see many OPs come and say \"I don't have a question. I just need to vent. I need to let off steam.\" That's great. But it doesn't bring solutions from habitual ways of doing things. We get to let off the steam just great but it starts rebuilding at once.  I am one who likes to shake it up a bit. When people come to Forum they come for help. Some of us will try to help by supporting and listening. So of us will try to help by shaking it up a bit so new thinking can get in. I am that latter one. I think you may be the former. The OPs come for help. They may not always be \"comfortable \" or even \"comforted\" by what they hear but they are free to leave the luggage lie and pick up the briefcases that work for them.

Father in Law moved in with us because we took H\u2019s mother in when diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. FIL never moved out. He was narcissistic. I did his laundry cooked his meals and he NEVER said thank you. It was expected. He completely invaded privacy. Talked about himself every night at dinner. Did no house chores just brought in the mail and went through it all. My H ( now ex) would spend so much time after dinner talking with him about this and that. I was no longer a priority in my relationship. When his father did inappropriate things like ask me to pretend to be his wife or peek in on me through bedroom window from outside back lanai or make very inappropriate comments or walk around with a pair of my panties  my H always had an excuse for his father. Oh he\u2019s just joking. You know he is awkward. I was so devalued and disrespected. I also resented that I had to buy all this mans groceries clothes dry cleaning when he had the financial means to do so. I was financially used. And I do blame my ex H for allowing this. I always wanted to be so kind but in the 4 years this man hijacked my life H  I left. I also started seeing a therapist in the last year which was so very helpful. I learned about narcissistic traits and behaviors. My H did not have the capacity to address his father. He was always the golden boy. His dad was so abusive to his mother when she was living including hitting her. In the earlier years of the old man living with us I thought it was me that just wasn\u2019t patient enough. I cried so much and had NO understanding from my H. Fast forward 4 years. I finally moved out. It wasn\u2019t solely because of fil I had a narcissistic H as well. He valued his dads money well interestingly enough as soon as I move out he puts his dad in assisted living. Anyway we did try to reconcile but I can\u2019t live with a manipulative gaslighting narcissist and all those behaviors really came out strong when his father who he is a chip off the old block moved in with us. It was the beginning of 4 years of hell. Working with a therapist helped me. My gosh you can\u2019t believe there are such scary people out there. So to answer your question yes caregiving did break my relationship but it brought so many things to light.

People that are put under their care have been diagnosed by their doctor as having 6 months or less to live and have opted out of traditional care for comfort care instead.  My husband was under hospice care in our home for the last 22 months of his life and while there were times when I had to get after them to make sure my husband was receiving the care he needed and deserved there was never a time when I thought that they were killing him.  Your father was obviously very ill and since you are a Christian you know that when God calls us Home that we will go Home regardless of the circumstances and whether or not we're under hospice care or not. So while I'm guessing that your grief is still very fresh I hope and pray that you will rest in the knowledge that your father is now in the arms of Jesus.

Before dad died I kept seeing 1:11 and 11:11 on the clock which was the angel signs to me that all was well up above; that dad was getting ready to transition and I wasn't doing anything 'wrong'. It gave me peace to see those angel signs. After he died I immediately started finding pennies (1s) and dimes (10s) that added up to 11s everywhere I went; I saved them all up and have A TON of pennies and dimes in a little bank. Anyway on that note I had a very vivid 'dream' or a visitation from dad one night. He was laughing and holding up a shiny penny in his fingers pushing his hand towards me saying \"Here's your penny for today!\" He was happy and healthy and not sick with a brain tumor as he was in his earthly form. I'll never forget that 'dream' and all it signified to me to this day and that was almost 7 years ago. It brought me great comfort to know that dad was whole and happy again on the other side.  My daughter was quite close with her grandfather too so she also had a 'dream' one night not long after he passed. He was laughing and calling her name which brought her a sense of comfort. She called me crying that she'd 'seen Gramps and he was looking and doing great!'   I have other stories too but that's it for now. So nice to read all of yours too! I think they're great!

Last year about three years after my Mom's passing (I was her live-in caregiver for 13 months until she passed) I woke up in the middle of the night and in that half-sleep state slowly rolled onto my back and opened my eyes.  Up by the ceiling was Mom head--fresh from the hairdresser's--and just behind and to the left of her head was a another woman's head--glowing bright white but not painful to the eyes. I stared and--to my distress afterward--I screamed. In that instant I blinked and they were gone.   I kick myself for screaming but it was so unexpected and ... shocking. Months later when I was reviewing the few paranormal instances I had seen in my life the unknown woman's silhouette fit exactly the young woman I saw when I was a teen--only then she was an entire young woman sitting on the edge of the bed erect posture straight blond hair hanging past her collarbones looking toward the floor her hands clasping in her lap wearing a white choir robe. She didn't move but it scared me and I ran out. If I cut out the shape of her head and her hair that's the entity just behind Mom. I'll never know if she was a relative or a guardian angel.

I'll recount my stories again here then.  This happened when my mother was very sick almost near death. For weeks she kept telling me that my late father came to her room to see her. I never saw anything so I figured it was her confused/tired mind that saw things. One night I was standing at her bed. She then pointed toward the end of the bed and said that my late father was standing there looking at her. I looked towards the end of the bed and saw nothing. I told her there was no one there. Then I saw him in the mirror walking out of the room through the wall and window.  Another strange thing that happened to me. This was years ago when I was studying for the CPA exam. That exam was only held twice a year and cost a good chunk of money to sign up and months and months of studying. The night before the exam I studied late into the night and set an alarm to wake me up early. Anyone who came late would not be allowed in. No exception. Well my alarm went off and I kept sleeping. What saved me was my cell phone. It rang and woke me up. I looked at the phone and it said unknown caller. I pushed answer and there was no one then the line got disconnected. The call came just in time for me to get ready and rushed to the exam location.", "date": "2022-01-11 02:42:43", "user_name": "polarbear", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/strange-sightings-after-a-love-one-had-passed-starting-up-this-conversation-for-2022-472259.htm"},

{"post_id": "473194", "title": "Have you seen this article in today\u2019s online Wall Street Journal?", "body": "Copy paste of the article for those locked behind the paywall.   Amy Goyer is AARP\u2019s family and caregiving expert. She has written two books on the subject and has her own consulting business. \u201cI am a caregiving expert. How did I end up in bankruptcy?\u201d she says. Ms. Goyer depleted her savings and ended up relying on credit cards after being financially drained by costs related to caring for her parents. After more than a decade of caring for her mom who had a stroke and her dad who\u00a0had Alzheimer\u2019s Ms. Goyer filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019.    Ms. Goyer started a consulting business which gave her more flexibility to care for her parents. She describes the bankruptcy experience as humiliating and embarrassing. But she says it shows how the unexpected costs of daily caregiving can accumulate over time and overwhelm even the most experienced of the\u00a0nation\u2019s 53 million family caregivers. Family caregivers are the backbone of the nation\u2019s long-term care system and provide an estimated $470 billion worth of free care\u2014often\u00a0at great personal cost. On average caregivers spend 26% of their personal income on caregiving expenses according to\u00a0a 2021 AARP study with most personal spending going to housing including home modifications. A third of caregivers dip into their personal savings like bank accounts to cover costs and 12% take out a loan or borrow from family or friends. Newsletter Sign-up The 10-Point. A personal guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal. \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand how expensive caregiving is\u201d says Jean Chatzky founder of HerMoney.com a digital media company focused on women and personal finance. Ms. Chatzky and others say family members incorrectly assume\u00a0Medicare will pay\u00a0for long-term care in nursing homes or in-home help only to be surprised when a relative falls ill or needs that kind of care.\u00a0Private long-term-care insurance\u00a0picks up some of those costs but the amount varies depending on the plan. Caregiving is becoming more expensive\u00a0because people are living longer with more complicated medical needs and hiring help costs more. The median annual cost of in-home care rose to $54912 in 2020 an 18.5% increase from 2016 according to Genworth a long-term-care insurance company. The financial strain is widespread. Although the average caregiver is 49 about 23% percent are millennials who have had less time in the workforce to build financial security. Concerns about the toll on family caregivers led to a recently introduced bipartisan Credit for Caring Act that would provide a tax credit of up to $5000 to eligible working caregivers.    Ms. Goyer displays photos of her parents Robert and Patricia Goyer. Ms. Goyer began her caregiving from a distance. Her parents lived in Phoenix. She lived in Alexandria Va. and worked in Washington for the AARP. While her sisters pitched in Ms. Goyer who was single childless and had a background in aging managed their care and ultimately financed a large part of it. At first she would fly to Arizona several times a year but began coming monthly as her parents\u2019 health declined. Her mother Patricia who had a stroke at the age of 63 had frequent hospitalizations and her dad\u2019s cognitive abilities began slipping. In 2009 the doctor said that he had Alzheimer\u2019s and that he should stop driving. \u201cThat is when everything changed. I picked up my life and moved\u201d says Ms. Goyer. Costs start to mount She left her full-time position at AARP and started a consulting business which gave her more flexibility to care for her parents but also meant added costs for things like health insurance. She found a continuing-care community for her parents and moved into their house taking over the mortgage and bills while maintaining her Washington-area apartment to be close to her clients and boyfriend.

My mom just turned 100 years old and is sharp as a tack (er...except when she isn't...we have our moments). She can't see well, can't hear well, isn't very mobile, but in her heart of hearts, she is still a vigorous young woman. She goes crazy if she doesn't have something to do. Sometimes I have to fib a little to keep her busy, but if any of you have this problem, here are a few things I do:</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Buy a cheap shredder and ask her for her help disposing of clutter. PROBLEM: You eventually run out of paper and things to shred, but it's good while it lasts!</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Buy a fast photo scanner. I print documents from my Word files and ask her to scan in every morning. Here's where I feel a little guilty: I usually having her scan the same thing every day. Saves on printer paper!</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Go to the bank and get several rolls of coins. Ask her to separate them into baggies. If she can do it, ask her to put them in wrappers.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Ask her to sort white clothes from colored clothes before you put them in the laundry.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Get a bunch of old towels (as many as possible), and go through your \"must go to Goodwill bags.\" Ask her to fold the towels and clothes.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 If she likes housekeeping (my mom doesn't, which is probably why I'm a neat freak), ask her to do some dusting.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Sit down and ask her advice...then listen seriously. She has decades of experience and you might learn something!</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Go to a YouTube or Audible that you think she might like, then give her earphones, make her comfortable and let her enjoy.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 If she doesn't mind reminiscing, ask her to dictate the memories of her life or write them out.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>0 Envelope stuffing. Another one I feel guilty over, but it does occupy her mind. Print out a hundred or so flyers (you can make them up yourself), put out a bunch of envelopes and tell her that a friend is starting a business and needs someone to help with the envelope stuffing. This one really makes me feel guilty. I don't like fibbing, but I feel a little better when I see that it makes her feel like she is contributing.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>These are just a few tips. I'd love to hear yours! I can use all the help I can get!!! Here's to our moms and dads and their desire to still be helpful, useful, and busy.

{"post_id": "471013", "title": "Update on Can I Sue The Nursing Home For Killing My Mother.", "body": ["<p>In December, about the 18th, I posted a discussion about suing the nursing home for killing my mother. Well, since then we tried to get several attorneys, everyone seemed like they wanted a $5.000.00 fee because they where not sure wether they could win or not. Then my brother had a serious discussion with me; he said that our mom would not want us to sue anybody. I was very angry with the nurses and doctors that I felt took my moms life to soon. Well, the long and short was there was never a law suit because my brother convinced me that they did everything they could, even-though some aspects of that I would have to strongly disagree with, but I did get some grief counseling with my sister and it helped tremendously. I had a serious problem because my grief had me going to a place where I truly wanted to see some people not living anymore, yes, I mean the nursing home staff and some of the doctors, but I worked through all of that, I had to go to some pretty intense therapy sessions before I just had to let that go and just be at peace with the fact that my mom was no longer in pain with that brain tumor. It was called a Gleioblastoma one of the most aggressive tumors that there are. I am however writing a book called \"The Dangers of Hospitals and Nursing Homes\" to make people more aware of thigs like what are they really getting themselves into, and stuff like about how they are going to become the \"Enemy Number One\" if they are there most of the time to watch out for their loved ones, and exposing what the care in a nursing home is really like. I am doing this post pandemic, and I will mention that in the preface of my book. I want it to get into the hands of people that have put their loved on into a nursing home or, had to do it because they had no other choice. I am going to sell it, send it to talk shows, news stations, etc... etc... etc... I want everyone to know the kind of crap they will pull if they can get away with it. For example, there where Nurses Aids that would literally hide from us when we needed to get their help. There was an inspection from the nursing homes higher ups and they where literally told to avoid the inspectors if the came their way. They told them to go the other way. I got charged for co-pays after my mothers death that they where not suppose to charge after her death. When a person dies they are no longer responsible for any bill that that loved one had, there was a guy stealing out of the nursing home patients funds that the family's put in for the patients so they had some money for themselves, he invested it in football tickets and sold it to other people at a huge markup. He got arrested and killed himself in jail. I didn't get to take them to court but I am going to expose them to the public so they cant hurt anybody else.</p>"], "date": "2021-11-05 01:53:11", "user_name": "trapwhisk", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Elder Abuse", "End of Life", "Grief"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm"},

Propaganda like this feeds the mentality that the only solution is to be a caregiver at home no matter what the cost mentally emotionally or physically\u2014and sometimes a combination of these. Doctors did a study and found that caregivers had a 63% higher mortality rate than others given similar variables. Were you ever a caregiver at home? If not you have no idea of what it takes to take care of someone especially with glioblastoma. Where would you have taken her if not a nursing home? You don\u2019t even mention what ways you think were detrimental to her. It doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re providing an alternatives so there\u2019s nothing constructive about this book. It\u2019s already common thinking that nursing homes are bad so why spread a generalization as truth?   At 65 my brother was diagnosed with glioblastoma. He needed 24/7 care. I found an excellent nursing facility on the Medicare website and placed him there along with getting hospice care. He\u2019s been there nine months and they\u2019ve both provided wonderful care. There was an inspection and his case was chosen to be examined. His tumor greatly affected his judgement impulsivity problem solving and his personality. It\u2019s evident that my brother is loved and cared for. Recently it looked like his death was eminent. For people upset because their loved one isn\u2019t being fed hospice explained to us that because his body is starting to shut down so he doesn\u2019t need much food if any. They lose the ability to swallow so feeding runs the risk of inhaling food and causing pneumonia. He\u2019s rallied some but now he\u2019s at the point where his brain says to get up but his legs are weak so he falls. Sometimes he refuses the meds that would calm down this activity. They can\u2019t force him to take them. Fortunately he\u2019s five feet from the nurses station so they can keep a closer eye on him. It\u2019s driving the nurses crazy because they want him to be safe but they can\u2019t restrain him and can\u2019t post an aide there 24/7. Obviously they care and worry about him.   So yes there are bad nursing homes\u2014I removed him from a previous one. But don\u2019t do a blanket smear job. Nursing homes are short on staff.

It's being prepared for the \"new\" normal is what I'm concerned about! How will it be? How will I adjust from living with and caregiving for 13 years to poof just gone?!? It's a lot. I over think it too sometimes!!! Back to my calming motto: one day at a time!! Love yourself too! Mom is lucky to have you! You deserve a pat on the back and time to pamper yourself! Go to Wal-Mart and get some bath bombs bubble bath a good smelling candle. Take a favorite book and have your own spa night after mom is asleep for the night! The good thing about old people is they live by a set schedule. At least my mom does. I know what she is going to do next before she does it!! That predictable.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": ["<p>I'm a 36 year old, only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and, since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7, I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke, so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills, endless phone calls, mountains of paperwork, and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much, and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating. <br>Add to that, I'm really sick of being a caregiver already, and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week, came home for a week, went in for another week, and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother, but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that, but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her, and I feel bad about it. I apologized, but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same. <br>I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues, the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes, the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits, I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy, but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up, having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything, having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot.<br>I'm tired of being trapped in this house, not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule, and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion.<br>I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition, but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984, she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet, and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health, but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried, despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so. <br>The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to, because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings, at home with me. <br>So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own, who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt, crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

As others here have observed and advised you your planned revelations are too dangerous will expose you to legal action and (IMHO) will not alleviate the anger you feel.  2.\u00a0 Your hostility and anger shows\u00a0 and DOMINATES loud and clear.\u00a0\u00a0 Attorneys sense this and can avoid becoming involved with someone hell bent on revenge by setting high retainer costs.\u00a0\u00a0 Attorneys do not need to be counselors and expose themselves or their staff to someone who seems to be vindictive angry and immune to helpful advice.  3.\u00a0\u00a0 You don't understand medical malpractice law and your method of expressing the alleged grievances doesn't fall within legal parameters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only people who are going to read your \"publication\" are those with similar approaches.  4.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter sentence also addresses how you will open yourself to either ignoring your online \"book\" or worse yet to retaliatory action from medical facilities especially if you're foolish enough to identify them.  5.\u00a0 If action in the last sentence occurs you could find yourself facing not only action against your own server access\u00a0but also restraint and cease and desist orders by the named facilities.\u00a0\u00a0 You could also face libel actions.\u00a0 You could be restrained by injunctive relief.\u00a0\u00a0   6.\u00a0\u00a0 You likely would be sued including for defamation.\u00a0\u00a0 The defense attorneys would probably file a motion for summary judgment to restrain you from further action but you would also likely be required to pay the costs of those you identify.\u00a0\u00a0 That means ALL COSTS ranging from time to copy and analyze your complaints have them reviewed by attorneys and/or medical people and the cost of filing a lawsuit with potential cease and desist prayers as well as the cost of serving any injunctive orders against you.  7.\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have several thousand dollars to engage in this hopeless endeavor?\u00a0 If not once the defense prevails judgments and \"cease and desist\" orders could and probably would be issued against you and either carried out through seizure orders or through a lien against your property.\u00a0 How would you handle that?\u00a0 Do you have enough money to pay off a multi-thousand dollar judgment and/or buy a new house?  8.\u00a0 This next comment is NOT intended to be cruel but it needs to be said.\u00a0 Caring for someone ranging from children to ill parents is very challenging emotional and frequently requires personal assessment.\u00a0 None of us want to feel as those we didn't handle these issues well.\u00a0\u00a0 We're often in territory none of us ever expected to be.\u00a0 We're struggling just as you were and are but it needs to be realized that leveling blame and hostility doesn't reverse anything.  Nor does it\u00a0\u00a0alleviate anyone by blaming someone else which is what you plan to do.\u00a0\u00a0 Therapy seems to have helped but not entirely.\u00a0 You NEED to get past this stage if you are to heal at all.\u00a0\u00a0   9.\u00a0\u00a0 Go back to therapy.\u00a0\u00a0 And continue with it until you understand that there are forces existent beyond our control that absolving ourselves of contributory actions and blaming others is NOT the solution.\u00a0\u00a0 Do you really think you're the only one who's experienced this?", "date": "2021-12-25 13:26:08", "user_name": "GardenArtist", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm"},

I know you say it\u2019s been a couple of weeks however it looks like you were \u201cintroduced\u201d into caregiving in the advance section!   Some of us caregivers caregiver quiet a while before those issues. You have been thrown into the deep end.   There\u2019s a book called The 36 Hour Day that you may want to read. And this forum here will give you encouragement and at least show you these feelings of anger and resentment are actually normal. Not great yet very common. Also your mothers behavior is very common. Seems like she hates you\u2026but the disease is messing with her mind. She doesn\u2019t know up from down real from fake - most of the time. Yet she does have her good moments and yes cherish those.   What I\u2019m finding out is caregiving is the most thankless job out there. It\u2019s like you volunteered to be someone\u2019s punching bag. Someone who used to love you but for unknown reasons now wants to make you miserable. However the reason for the caregiver is known\u2026it\u2019s the dementia. You know your mother does love you she just can\u2019t tell you/show you they way she used to. Her world is upside down and she doesn\u2019t even know it.  For the long term if there\u2019s any support you can rustle up\u2026a local support group in person online or phone. Forums like this one they will help take the edge off. Educate yourself with online reading about dementia caregiving whenever you can.  For the short term take a deep breath. Remember it\u2019s the disease treating you like crap not your mom. Get some fresh air. Put on some music. Splash some water in your face. Pet your dog/cat\u2026pet the neighbors dog/cat\u2026just one positive thing no matter how small. It won\u2019t seem like enough but do it anyway. Go into another room and cry until you can\u2019t anymore. Just know you are not alone and what you are experiencing all of us on this site have been thru or are currently going thru. Look into hiring help to take some of the weight off you look into financial assistance. I totally relate to the red tape\u2026that\u2019s stressful enough. I blew off a Dr appt that we\u2019d had for months because I had the time wrong! They sent at least 4 reminders\u2026yet I still got the time wrong! At times I think I\u2019m getting dementia! I have so much paperwork\u2026.it seems like I\u2019ve been doing paperwork for 2 yrs now! However if you can get some help it\u2019ll be worth it.  You are only human. You feel angry when not treated right. Who wouldn\u2019t? Don\u2019t beat yourself up for feeling normal. I wish I could make all this go away but no one can. Find ways to get caregiver support. It\u2019ll be your lifeline now that you\u2019re in the deep end. Yeah I\u2019ve told you some things to do\u2026.as if you don\u2019t have enough to do already.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Dear Rosewater I had to take care of my husband in our home who had frontotemporal dementia with the worst of it lasting 6 years. He died in Dec 2020. As I read your situation I had flashbacks of nearly everything you describe. With every flash feeling like a kick in the gut highlighted with the vivid memories of me being so afraid I\u2019d do the wrong thing paralleled with anxiety over how very long I might have to be in our situation with no one to turn to. We didnt qualify for medicaid no matter how much we spent down due to working hard our whole lives and now receiving pensions that place us above the poverty levels in our state. However if I placed him in memory care there would be nothing left with which to pay our bills. So I can truly feel your pain and the worry and fear that you fight over just \u201cliving day to day\u201d. You took a lot of time and effort with your post and I hope you felt even a little relief after doing so. You most likely have a lot ahead of you that could be difficult. You sound like a very strong and able young woman! Your mental abilities to cope will make all the difference in your ability to establish personal boundaries hence find joy as you move forward. Being a caregiver challenges even the strongest of us!! Can I get an amen from fellow posters!!! Sorry I digress!!! Given what you\u2019ve shared you have no reason to feel guilty or in any way like scum. I would tell you from my experience to find a good psychological counselor that can give you feedback on a regular basis like weekly or monthly so you can rid yourself of the negative emotions as you feel them. They are real feelings and you can\u2019t just wish them away but a trained counselor can help you apply logic to figure out which are the draining emotions that aren\u2019t valid but healthy boundaries. I would bet literally everyone on this site has felt the exact same emotions you describe. Its what makes this caregiving so incredibly difficult. If you have insurance they can direct you to counselor\u2019s in your network. If no insurance many churches have counselors on staff. Many are free or ask you to pay whatever you can. The point being there is no shame in fact it is critical for you getting yourself the help you need and do it early on. This is important so you can make decisions that you will NOT regret down the road after mom is gone. There will be so many decisions and with all you have done and are already doing\u2026you have all that it takes to be a great caregiver and decision maker for your mom. Whether that means assisted living or in home nurses or whatever you decide. It does however take a \u201cheaping load\u201d of mental fortitude so find someone to talk with so you can keep your emotional dumpster emptied and then with each day and each decision you will do great!!! Let me add also If you are a spiritual person leaning on your faith will also strengthen you in ways you might not have known before! God bless you on your journey.

But if your LO is in a place with little or no distractions I don't think one has to make activities into a dog-and-pony show: just talk to the admin and ask if you can come once a week/month whatever to entertain the people. But you should commit to a regular schedule and confirm with the admin prior to every appearance so that you can be looped in on their schedule changes. Maybe do it right after one of the meals so the staff doesn't have to gather participants in one place? Gathering people will tax the staff and burn up a lot of time. It can be like herding cats. If residents' LOs are informed of the activity and invited to just bring their LO and be present you may develop a pool of interested volunteers.   When my son was young he went to a non-profit daycare/preschool and \"Grandma Pat\" used to come and have storytime with the older kids once a week. She was just a neighborhood Granny (or attended the church that housed the preschool) and I don't think she even had a relative at that daycare. She was greated like a rock star when she came (and she was very advanced in years).   I've served on several boards of non-profit organizations that depend on volunteers and although it sounds lovely in theory it has proven challenging to keep the same volunteers coming on the same schedule. Retired people don't seem to like being on a committed schedule anymore (not that I blame them). In the summertime teenagers who are too young to work may be a good pool of helpers or entertainers. Some highschools now required some community service (in the US) as part of their graduation requirement. Boy or Girl Scouts (if they can stop peddling cookies for a minute). Maybe talk to a church youth group pastor (they are often grateful for ideas and outlets for their kids). It will be easier to solicit help if your activity has a defined beginning and end date because it will be a more tolerable commitment.

How can you take such an accusation seriously when dementia is at play then question whether MIL 'deserves' commitment time and/or respect or just to be left alone or does that mean totally ignored? My mother said a LOT of mean &amp; nasty things to me while riddled with dementia. If I took each one to heart &amp; decided she no longer deserved my respect or attention I'd have ditched her years ago &amp; made her a ward of the state. Instead I chalked the majority of her angst off to the disease and continued to do my best to make sure she was well cared for in her Memory Care AL. She was pretty far gone from reality during the last 6 months of her life but again not due to anything she brought on herself but due to advanced dementia robbing her of her mind. What I did for her was out of love and what I felt to be the right thing to do on MY part nothing else.   When she got particularly nasty I'd back off on the phone calls and visits for a while to let things calm down mostly ME. The next time I'd see her or speak to her it was like nothing had ever happened b/c she didn't remember she'd said something foul. Again the nature of the beast. The breaks were for ME more so than anything to give ME a chance to calm down &amp; regroup. It's never easy to deal with a demented elder to say the least but if it's a loved one we're in charge of via POA or just b/c of love then we have to do what we have to do regardless. If your MIL was accusing you of such ridiculous things while LUCID well that would be another story entirely.   Give her a break from your visits and then pick back up like nothing ever happened. She won't remember saying that she wants nothing to do with you ever again I can practically guarantee it. By tomorrow she'll be off on a different tangent entirely.   So to answer your question yes elders far gone from reality do deserve commitment time and respect from individuals and from society b/c they are human beings suffering from a disease they didn't ask for and cannot help having *in my opinion*. I think we all argue back with outrageous accusations however when the better thing to do is just leave the room.

It also leaves dad who realistically should have been paying from the get go. Dad owns stocks and bonds they go into care. So does this detached home of his if it is actually his. If he is set to fund his luxury retirement for x years it is on him to do so.  And edit. It would sure help us if you\u2019d be a little less double o seven in your posts.

So then she felt bad and said she would call back if she couldn\u2019t get things under control. So now it seems like she\u2019s ruling us. She of course went nuts when she heard the word ambulance coming for her and someone from the apartment building showed up to see what was going on. Neither of us feel comfortable trying to transport her in our own vehicles, so we\u2019ve sort of made up our mind the ambulance is coming tomorrow like it or not.

Ok I hope you had that visual thing checked out and didn't just write it off to stress...b/c it could have been any number of things and it's definitely a warning sign that all is not well with you!  You were the good daughter who took care of her parents. Kudos to you for caring so much for them (I didn't say ABOUT them for a reason).   Now it's time to step away.   They don't LIVE with you so that part is done.   They fight b/c that's the marriage dynamic they have always had and always will. My inlaws battled like they were in a frickin war all the time. MIL hated FIL so much it was palpable. They finally divorced in after 42 years of vitriol &amp; hate.   FIL died 17 years ago but MIL acts like he's still here and she is as angry today as she was the day something 'bad' happened. THAT'S no way to live. And it is NOT the kids' responsibility to make it be OK. Bet your mom will be the same when your dad passes.   I would change my phone number and get a cheap 'burner' type cell phone to use to call them and only give them that number. Then DON'T answer it or call them unless you can handle it.   They're in some kind of NH? Or do they live alone? Either way *you* need to get out of the CG business!! Like yesterday!  If they live in a NH the staff there should be handling a lot of this. If they live independently hire a couple of thick skinned CG's and let them deal with your folks. Trust me an employee is much less invested emotionally and the fighting and such may ramp down around 'strangers'.   Quit chasing your dad down when he 'runs away'. Call the police. Refuse to pick him up. I think your folks are trying to outdo each other for the 'worst life ever' award. (Sorry but that belongs to MY MIL. )  Once you've hired help--cut down any contact with them to a 2 hr window once a week. It will be tough but at this rate you will die long before they do. I assume there are no siblings around? All of this is on you--rather you took it on you. Now give it back.   Another alternative if finances aren't an issue (And I am aware that they usually are) is to split them up into separate living places.

I think an aide should be paid at least $30 per hour. This is back-breaking work. It is undervalued and oftentimes leads to back trouble etc. These private companies want the most work for the least amount of $$$.  Keep in mind gas has gone up so that's another issue with the bottom line. CNA's need to unionize and be paid a just and fair wage. My Lord you could sell mascara online from your kitchen table with that low of pay.  It is my opinion that many of the refugees in Europe will be the caregivers of the elderly. Take for example Italy where the population growth is at an all-time low since no one is having children and the millennials are forced to leave their country and seek work in other places. Who cares for the loved ones left behind?  During the Pandemic the Eastern European Refugees were caring for the elderly in Europe (Italy) when all of a sudden they had no place to go. Children came for their parents and the refugees were basically left homeless and they couldn't fly anywhere.  Caregiving is dirty work. When I look at what athletes are paid I can't get over it. Wouldn't it be nice if family took their loved ones in but it doesn't always work that way for a number of reasons.  It shouldn't be treated where we look at caregiving like ok you are lucky not to be living in a worn-torn country we are taking you into our country you're lucky you can find work have the refugees do it. This demanding grueling work should be paid in a dignified manner including--medical dental prescription eyecare pension 10 sick days/vacation gas mileage and paid training on a continuing basis CPR Training etc. and a classy uniform. It's watered down to custodial work and these are human beings on both sides the caregiver and the patient.

She told me she was hired given our address told to call about the times and sent here. It's alright at this time as all she has to do is be here while I make a grocery run or have an appointment of my own. I just want someone in the house with my DH in case of outside emergency which I know he cannot handle. This is an agency hire so I know she is not getting $18 an hour. Medical aides are also offered at this agency not sure yet if the costs are the same.   The baby boom generation is following along behind many of us and they are more demanding more entitled just more people aging at the same time. This is going to cause change to happen good or bad yet to be seen. There is already such a need for aides and not many available.

{"post_id": "473503", "title": "Moving Mom", "body": ["<p>Well, we moved Mom into the Memory Care Facility with the small house concept and 16 maximum residents last 3/10/21. Yep, Thursday, 3/10/22 will be moving out day for her, one year to the day from when she got there. I gave it my best shot to try to get her the care she needs but it just was not available there for lots of reasons, mainly due to the caregivers.</p>", "<p>Sure, if you can walk and talk and dress yourself and feed and toilet yourself, you will do great where Mom is! Most of the residents in her \"house\" can do all those things. You would think that would give the caregivers extra time to be able to work with the residents who can not do all those (or any of those) things, like my Mom. There are only three out of 15 residents who need that high level of individual care. But it did not work that way. The caregivers, for the most part, preferred to be sitting in the kitchen area on their phones, texting, instead of providing care for the residents who needed extra care. And, since my Mom can not speak, she could not ask for what she might be needing.</p>", "<p>Mom can't walk, but constantly had bruises and cuts on her arms and legs. I once watched a couple of caregivers transfer Mom on to the toilet and it was as if they were heaving a sack of potatoes. She developed a pressure sore on her buttocks and the caregivers were told by the nurse to reposition Mom every two hours. Did they? Never when I was there which was every day for several hours at a time. They were supposed to check her for wetness every few hours since she suffered from one UTI after another. Mostly they just put her in her bed or in her recliner and left her and went about their business.</p>", "<p>Of course, I mentioned these things to the caregivers and finally went to the Executive Director to voice my concerns about Mom's care. This went on for almost a year. Sure, promises were made that the staff would be addressed and reminded of what they should be doing. For a day or so, things would seem to get better, but then it was right back to \"business as usual.\"</p>", "<p>Yes I know Covid created many difficulties for community care facilities. That is why I waited until after the worst part of Covid(at the time) was over to place Mom. The facility where she lived promised that our \"house\" would always have a House Manager plus 2 caregivers on duty for each shift (except overnight where there would only be one caregiver). In the year Mom was there, we had a House Manager for only 4 months. The rest of the time, it was only two caregivers (and they seemed to be different people every day with the use of lots of agency caregivers),who had to cook 3 meals, tend to the residents and clean the house and do the laundry!! Not much time left for quality care.</p>", "<p>I found a Residential Small Group Home that is actually in my neighborhood (.8 mile away) that gets wonderful reviews and has 6 residents with two caregivers. I like those odds better! The cost is also less than where she was. I hope and pray Mom gets the care here that she needs and has a chance for more socialization with residents who are more \"like her\".</p>", "<p>We'll see, I guess. I am expecting some decline with the confusion of moving to a new place but she will have her furniture, pictures, etc. And I can be there every day to provide continuity. She is under Hospice care now, so that will be even more hands-on care for her. I'll post again to update on how things are going.

They have been very helpful!", "body": ["<p>I want to begin by saying thank you to you all for your posts and encouragement on these forums. They have been very helpful to me. I don\u2019t post (until now), but I do read what others have posted in situations similar to my own.</p>", "<p>We had another rough Christmas this year with my narcissistic parents and I need to vent a bit and get some feedback if possible. In a nutshell, I am 55, the oldest (daughter), with a 51-year-old brother who is a drug addict, felon, and homeless. He is the golden child and I am the scapegoat. My parents, both 75, moved 6 hours away from our hometown where we all resided about 12 years ago. They both take lots of medications, including antidepressants, etc., which is beginning to affect them cognitively. The distance has been a good thing for us, though.</p>", "<p>I have cut off all contact with my brother due to his addictions, choices, and behaviors. I do not discuss my brother with my parents, especially my mother. Last year, in about September, I received a phone call from my father stating that they were driving down here to pick up my brother and take him back to their home in Tennessee. At Christmas, my husband and I had to drive up there and remove him from their home as he was taking advantage of them, not working, and doing drugs. I knew this was going to happen, but had to wait until there was a crisis. My mother keeps trying to \u201csave\u201d him, and gets my father to go along with her plans.</p>", "<p>This Christmas they wanted to drive down here to celebrate with me and my family, and Mom asked if my brother could come celebrate with us. Of course I said no, and she got mad at me. They came, they acted perturbed, and stayed in the bedroom much of the time when they were here. They would come out in the evening to watch tv with us, and one night out of the blue my father told me in front of my husband, \u201cI\u2019m going to kick your butt!\u201d Twice. I just said, \u201cOk. Pop.\u201d When I told Mom about it later, she giggled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s your Father!\u201d Then, on Christmas eve, we had a big family gathering with our 5 kids and their families. My mother decides to show out in front of everyone (she loves an audience), and screams my name at the top of her lungs from the bedroom, upset about my father not wanting to wear an ugly Christmas sweater. Then she comes out yelling at me, and I corner her in the dining room away from everyone to let her \u201cvent\u201d and not cause too big of a scene. And, yes, I was very embarrassed, but I handled it ok. On Christmas day they met my brother at a truck stop for a meal, came home, went to bed, packed up and left early on the 26th. I purposefully did not communicate with them for 3 days since that time, and have had limited contact since then as I am done with this situation. My mother knows something is up, as she has been texting me more frequently telling me what a \u201cwonderful\u201d visit they had. I told her I was on vacation from my cell phone, and spending time with my husband who was off for the holidays.</p>", "<p>My parents are very secretive about things, and will not tell me anything about anything regarding their life plans, etc. I have finally let it all go, and will intervene when something happens. I will continue to be the responsible daughter I should be, but from a great distance. My husband and I have a wonderful marriage, 5 awesome and well-adjusted adult children, and 1 sweet granddaughter. This is what I will be focusing on from here on out.</p>", "<p>FYI\u2026(I went through several years and thousands of dollars of therapy about 15 years ago, to deal with the dysfunction I grew up in, and to get to this place in my life. I am very protective of who I am now, my family, and where I am in my life).

My kids were going to be at their inlaws for Christmas this year, so we all got together the Sunday before to have a meal and exchange gifts. My sister and family, my 2 adult kids and their families.

Then Wed, back to normal,, sitting up,ate, having a nice visit with her cousin. So, I thought ok, just needed some downtime.<br>Then Christmas eve, it all changed. Back to bed, not eating, sleeping, not able to rouse at all, would mumble and shift in bed, hold your hand but not open eyes.

They administerd a low dose of morphine only a couple of times over those days when they bathed and changed her as she exhibited some distress then.

You're obviously very upset about the standard of care and I don't blame you.  Every hospital and/or primary care trust has a PALS team. It takes time but you can approach these people to raise your concerns and ask questions about the negligence/neglect you believe caused your friend's death.

The reason I ask is that these forms detail what level of care any individual of any age has stated he or she wants to receive in the event that they need interventions when they're not able to make decisions. There has been controversy about them in the last year or two because as in every bureaucratic system (which the NHS certainly is as even its best friends would not deny) the strong emphasis on getting patients to complete them has led to too many reported cases of the job's being done clumsily heartlessly hastily sometimes to the great distress of the patient's friends and family when for example they don't agree with the patient's choice of DNACPR.

Unless a capable patient or their legal spokesperson signs a DNR for the file CPR will always be performed in the event of cardiac arrest. It is more likely that your friend didn\u2019t want the quality of life putting her body through CPR and fixing the underlying cause of her heart stopping would most likely provide and chose to be a DNR herself. It\u2019s not something the hospital can decide for a patient.   Depending on her consciousness and swallowing ability amongst other things they may very well have kept her dentures from her they can be both a choking hazard and a barrier to air/breathing adjuncts if needed in an emergency. Dentures are always taken out before surgery and often held out for a while for these medical reasons. But if she was eating or cleared to eat solid foods sitting up and breathing fine unfortunately they may have been overlooked like her glasses and watch. Hospitals rehabs and nursing homes were understaffed before COVID now the nursing and support staff are more than overworked it\u2019s amazing they keep their heads above water at all. I think it has always been the case that the more a patients family and friends can be around to help with those things as they know the patient best and are able to devote their full attention to that one person the better for that patient. It is a crime that the people who chose caregiving as a profession simply don\u2019t have the time to spend attending to these things for their patients believe me most are as frustrated as you that they don\u2019t but when you consider the things that take precedent it\u2019s hard to argue because you want those things to take precedent when it comes to your LO too. It\u2019s too bad your friend didn\u2019t have anyone who was able to be around to take care of these things for her.  It sounds like she had an IV set up with fluids to help combat her dehydration maybe another indication she wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep hydrated herself. That is a closed system there wouldn\u2019t be any air in the bag or lines to pump into her. The bag is supposed to run out and they measure how much fluid they put in over a period of time and how much comes out so an empty bag not being replaced rite away is normal and not dangerous though they typically do remove the bag the next time they are in the room and close off the IV line until it\u2019s time for the next bag. Only certified people are able to do this though not just anyone who comes in the room.  I would be very surprised if many COVID deaths weren\u2019t DNRs as well so many have been elderly but that isn\u2019t what killed them. Performing CPR on a patient with COVID that advanced may prolong their life hooked up to breathing machines and comatose but that\u2019s not the way I would want to go nor is it something I would want for someone I care about.  It sounds like your friend was a strong vibrant woman who had lived a full life and wanted to continue living a full life.

If you're proceeding on the assumption that MIL is Covid + then your husband needs to set up separate living and sleeping and bathroom areas for her so that she can be quarantined - is it possible to do that in the space you have available?   Masks' main purpose is to prevent the wearer exhaling water vapour carrying live virus and thus spreading it around to other people. Unless you're going the whole hog with hi-spec respirators (expensive and uncomfortable and I'm not even sure they make them for children) masks won't do much to filter out any incoming microbes and protect the wearer. So don't bother. Open windows if possible (what's the weather like and how high are your heating bills?) to improve ventilation and tell the little ones not to sit on grandma's knee.  If other family members were testing positive then clearly there is no objection to testing in principle so why on earth did they not test MIL? Too difficult? Is her dementia so far gone that you can't explain to her what you're doing and why you need to? Do you have access to either kind of testing kit?  Is MIL showing any symptoms? Who's monitoring her and does your husband know what to look for? If he hasn't already he needs to download an app with up to date advice on this.   Day to day care - what are MIL's care needs and how are they being met?  2. What the heck..?

It's an eventuality we're all facing vaxxed or unvaxxed. In fact the vaxxed are facing MORE positive tests than the unvaxxed these days that's a fact. To live is to face illness every day. Being that you are vaxxed you should feel better to think you'll face a lesser degree of illness if you do test positive and become symptomatic in the first place right? That was the point in getting jabbed to begin with or so we're told. The children face very mild symptoms if any that's also a fact.  I personally think you have a bigger problem inviting an angry and aggressively demented elder to live in your home (assuming that's where she lives) &amp; be exposed to your children on a daily basis than you do dealing with potential Covid.

Grief also happens and sometimes it happens to look just like this post.   Tooth - I am sorry this happened to you and that you feel your loved didn\u2019t matter enough to those who made that decision. I see she meant a lot to you - she most likely knew that very well. Thank you for caring for her and about her so much.   There we\u2019re plenty of drs since my moms stroke that made statements or tried to influence their views and also ones who made their own conclusions when meeting her with UTIs. Is my moms journey a hard one - Yes! When asked if she wants to live or is happy with the decisions we have had to make for her - her answer is yes she wants to be here and she would have made the same decisions thus far. For now she is happy that she got 3 more years . Others have gone in early morning during UTI treatments to persuade her to sign one and then come to persuade me to do the same - and not once or twice but over and over - it is not okay. I do not have rose colored glasses on -I am not blind to our lives - I like drs who give me the truth so I can prepare as best I can - I am a communicator - I want to know what every option looks like - but I have also had more (in hospital settings) try to shove their opinions down our throats than not. When it doesn\u2019t feel like actual helping families make hard decisions and feels more like \u201cthey are telling you what your choice should be\u201d it does leave people questioning if they did the right thing.

After moms stroke - she mostly slept - her eyes stayed closed but she answered everything with thumbs up and thumbs down in the ICU - And I mean everything from \u201cdid you pay your health insurance\u201d to \u201cis this the correct password for your computer and accounts\u201d - she thumbs up and down and was correct on every one of them - my mom was 71 - lived on her own - ran a business and even though she was hooked to machines and couldn\u2019t talk or eat - and slept a lot she still comprehended every question - after her brain swelling went down and she was finally in the clear - the Neuro took me aside and said \u201chere is your moms scan - it was a large stroke and your saying she was independent so though she will most likely talk again - swallow and eat and probably walk she will have cognitive disabilities and won\u2019t like her life \u201c she then said I wouldn\u2019t put the feeding tube in\u201d and go home with hospice. I asked more - I told her I would think about what she said and I would review her living will (I did listen to her - but it also made no sense) after she left I thought - \u201cshe told me she will walk and talk and eat and swallow and mom is answering every question I ask her correctly\u201d - this is only day 7/8 and I need to give my mom more time to heal - I read and researched stroke recovery etc (and had been learning for days while in ICU) then the next day told her - I wanted the feeding tube.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Update on Can I Sue The Nursing Home For Killing My Mother.", "body": ["<p>In December, about the 18th, I posted a discussion about suing the nursing home for killing my mother. Well, since then we tried to get several attorneys, everyone seemed like they wanted a $5.000.00 fee because they where not sure wether they could win or not. Then my brother had a serious discussion with me; he said that our mom would not want us to sue anybody. I was very angry with the nurses and doctors that I felt took my moms life to soon. Well, the long and short was there was never a law suit because my brother convinced me that they did everything they could, even-though some aspects of that I would have to strongly disagree with, but I did get some grief counseling with my sister and it helped tremendously. I had a serious problem because my grief had me going to a place where I truly wanted to see some people not living anymore, yes, I mean the nursing home staff and some of the doctors, but I worked through all of that, I had to go to some pretty intense therapy sessions before I just had to let that go and just be at peace with the fact that my mom was no longer in pain with that brain tumor. It was called a Gleioblastoma one of the most aggressive tumors that there are. I am however writing a book called \"The Dangers of Hospitals and Nursing Homes\" to make people more aware of thigs like what are they really getting themselves into, and stuff like about how they are going to become the \"Enemy Number One\" if they are there most of the time to watch out for their loved ones, and exposing what the care in a nursing home is really like. I am doing this post pandemic, and I will mention that in the preface of my book. I want it to get into the hands of people that have put their loved on into a nursing home or, had to do it because they had no other choice. I am going to sell it, send it to talk shows, news stations, etc... etc... etc... I want everyone to know the kind of crap they will pull if they can get away with it. For example, there where Nurses Aids that would literally hide from us when we needed to get their help. There was an inspection from the nursing homes higher ups and they where literally told to avoid the inspectors if the came their way. They told them to go the other way. I got charged for co-pays after my mothers death that they where not suppose to charge after her death. When a person dies they are no longer responsible for any bill that that loved one had, there was a guy stealing out of the nursing home patients funds that the family's put in for the patients so they had some money for themselves, he invested it in football tickets and sold it to other people at a huge markup. He got arrested and killed himself in jail. I didn't get to take them to court but I am going to expose them to the public so they cant hurt anybody else.</p>"], "date": "2021-11-05 01:53:11", "user_name": "trapwhisk", "reply": true, "keywords": ["Elder Abuse", "End of Life", "Grief"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

If you can't recycle everything as you did before forgive yourself and promise to do more once you are \"emancipated\" from this responsibility. In the meantime allow yourself to cut some corners and use single-use plastic utensils and paper or foam plates if it helps. I've come to rely on frozen vegetables to reduce food waste but it's still inevitable with my mother's wildly vacillating food demands. I maintain a large compost pile so the vegetables get a second chance at life but it still feels like failure to find them lost and decaying in the fridge.   Speaking of decay in the fridge: my mother ordered quarts of this special holiday fruit salad at Thanksgiving and finished off one of them in a timely fashion. The other one got pushed deep into the back of the fridge and lost for about a month. When I discovered it and told her it needed to go she threw a scary fit and threatened me with police action if I threw it away. I've warned her so many times about eating spoiled food but she won't listen. So more than a month after it was prepared and sold to her she eats half of the old container and then has terrible diarrhea for three days. She tried to deny eating it and refused to tell me where the container was (she stuffed in the freezer). She refuses to wear her incontinence underwear so I'm washing round-the-clock normally; this 3-day event really pushed the limits of the appliances and me. No sooner did that resolve when she decided that she would just have a normal bowel movement in her bed (over several hours and several bedding changes). While trying to manage this round of laundry I reached the incontinence pad with the large \"load\" and just said F'IT I'm throwing this one in the trash. It felt so liberating and was the nicest thing I'd done for myself in a very long time.  You can't control your sleep schedule (I'm right there with you on that issue--it's torturous and I expect to have PTSD in response to doorbells long after my mother passes) and you can't control your mom's behavior so just give yourself permission to cut corners and survive.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Update on Can I Sue The Nursing Home For Killing My Mother.", "body": "I have officially started on my book \"The Dangers of Hospitals and Nursing Homes. I got all my notes from the time I started taking notes back when all this was happening. I interviewed my brother my sister and from my memories I am pretty sure that I am going to have to so a lot of editing to put everything in the right order. When I get this book done I am going to put up my servers with roaming i.p. addresses and make it avelable for free for the first 90 days. I will post a link when I am done. I think that people should be armed with the information that I am about to give them. During our time having to deal with the hospital / Nursing Home this has taught me a few many things about how they operate. For example: The nursing homes hire the people that are the bottom of the barrel and they just show up do their jobs and collect a handsome paycheck every 2 week's. I mean you can tell the ones that are generally there for a paycheck and ones that truly care about the patient's / resident's; I can count 5 people at this nursing homes that where genuinely there for the patient's and not just the paycheck. here is one of the little tidbits that I am going to give you. If your loved one has to go in a nursing home for one reason or another you should look for one that is a non profit because they will give the resident way better care than a for profit nursing home; all the for profit's do are take peoples \"social security\" give them not very good food and are a lot more neglectful to the patient's than the ones that are non profit. and another one of my helpful tips is to watch out when they try to put your loved one on \"nursing home medicaid\" because they will take your original medicaid and your loved one \"Social Security\" Away and you will then become long term care and your loved one will be refereed to as incarcerated as one nursing home staff informed me of. If they are paying rent they will loose their place to live and they only way they will be able to get out is to leave \"AMA\" \"Against Medical Advice\" or have a family member that they can stay with and re-establish their life. The nursing home will try to sway your against this because they want that \"Social Security\" because the longer you are in there the more they get paid from the state because of your rooming and board. I think they also get grant's because the medicaid will pick up half of your cost and the grant will pick up the other half of your tab for being in their. So like I said I will post a link to my book when it is done so it can be downloaded for free for 90 days because I want everybody that can to read it because it is going to be armed with some very helpful information before you make that decision to put your loved one in any kind of a nursing home situation.", "date": "2021-12-24 03:05:09", "user_name": "trapwhisk", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Has anyone just lost the \"lust for life\"?", "body": "Just wait until she dies. When my mom died I was left on my own and two years later I'm still struggling except at age 61 I get tired easier and carrying on with my own life is exceptionally difficult. Now I did manage to forge my own life but it has been HARD! I don't know your financial situation but you will be left totally alone and the bills will keep on coming. You need to try to forge your own life but the older you get the more difficult it will be. You will have to battle things like age discrimination. The sad truth is--unless you have plenty of money the older you get the less people will want you. If this sounds grim--it is. I'm not going to sugar coat we live in a very youth-oriented society. I look in the mirror and I really realized mom ate up my life caring for her but she also could not help having 15 years of Alzheimer's disease with insulin-dependent diabetes and the last 6 years of her life--required 24/7 even though for decades she needed supervision due to her many chronic diseases she managed to live 90 years 3 months and died with excellent skin. I never moved away from my mom. I never left my mom until she died. And I'm having to live on my own without her.   But some people live to be 100 and at age 93 she has a good chance of living more years. I would give my soul to Satan if I could have my mom back. She was my entire universe and I lost her forever...so enjoy having your mom while she lasts because when people die it is for all eternity. Never to be seen again. BUT just look at this sentence and see how SELFISH it is. With mom's multiple chronic diseases that would be cruel because mom died very very peacefully and never suffered and if she came back she would have to die all over again--life is in reality an ORDEAL and she's beyond that that nothing can ever hurt her. We face possible WW3 -- it is the living that represents suffering.   Right now you need to plan on her dying get pre-arranged funeral/cremation and estate planning so see an eldercare attorney. Trust me you will go through pure hell with a quagmire of paperwork and legal garbage -- DEATH IS EXPENSIVE and is pure business. If you depend on you mom financially you really will have a hard time because you have to get your ducks in a row and FIND A JOB FAST. At age 65...good luck with that.   MAKE SURE WHEN SHE DIES NOTHING GOES TO PROBATE.   While I suffer many fears in life..hey you only have one life to live...so live it -- but when she does die for the first time in my life I also have a chance to live. I also realize I got so used to being tied to my mom I could not cope outside of that and for the first time that cage has been opened. So it is my first breath of life on my own.   Don't give up hope. I got married have a job and inching toward my Master's degree.

I am so sorry for your feelings of despair I remember them all too well. I was caregiver for five years to my dear Mother who passed with dementia and Parkinson\u2019s.   I had always been a working girl and then all the sudden my job is to stay home and take care of this dear woman. I did go into a depression. I wasn\u2019t prepared for it no one talks about it we have no training or education in this area. It\u2019s no wonder we struggle.  My dear mother has passed and I can only tell you looking back that it was one of the most difficult things I have done in my life but I did it and I can say I am proud that I did it! I do have a sibling but for some reason he went MIA the last five years of my mom\u2018s life.  This forum was a great source of stress release as I recall several times I would get on here and say \u201cI just can\u2019t do it anymore\u201d and I would get responses care from these wonderful people that were going through the same thing and then I\u2019d go onto the next day.   You can do this you will do this. Try to take time for yourself even it\u2019s a five minute daily walk. And come to this forum to vent again I can promise you in the end you will be so proud of the love care concern that you put forth into the care of your dear mother.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Has anyone just lost the \"lust for life\"?", "body": "I can understand. I\u2019m an only child in a similar situation. The important thing is to not abandon yourself your passions and your own life-identity. As only children it\u2019s too easy to get enmeshed with our parents it comes with the territory of having no other immediate family so I get it. But please take my advice and always carve out time for you even if it means waking up early to do exercises or read a novel just for fun. Also take time out for socials! Look up meetup in your area and find ways to meet new people and don\u2019t rule out romance you may meet someone nice. Don\u2019t allow age to get you down it\u2019s never too late to start over and set goals. If you can afford it hire a nurse to stay with your mom for a few hours each week just do you can do whatever you want. It seems that most of your life you\u2019ve been giving and doing practical stuff and all this seriousness can really take away a lust for life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m encouraging you to ditch the \u201cshoulds\u201d and give yourself this time to just be silly and hedonistic you need and deserve it otherwise you will burn out. If it\u2019s not possible to leave home then get creative with how you can entertain at home\u2014arrange a part of your home so that one side is your \u201capartment\u201d or cave and maybe organize your own meetup there. What are your hobbies? Do you have any dreams goals or aspirations that you had to put on hold because of caretaking? Can you revisit them? Be flexible. A dream may have to change its form to suit your current situation but let the passion ignite your fire. Play music! Create playlists on your smartphone or just go old school and play CDs and records (which are cool again). Get out your favourite clothes and just wear them around the house! Yes that evening gown or cocktail dress counts. Just wear them on a Monday to the grocery the post office. Make everyone including yourself believe that you\u2019re going somewhere! And you are. Fashion along with makeup abs hairstyling can literally wake up your soul and get you going. Eat your favorite food. Cook all your favorite dishes and get out your crystal silverware and celebrate life with mom. Don\u2019t wait for a special occasion the fact that you\u2019re together is something to celebrate. Use the internet to get ideas. The public library too is a great place to create a book club knitting club. The reference librarian can assist you with finding resources. I understand how easy it is to get isolated especially during this time but if you can use the time at home to talk more to neighbors and local businesses this will bring cheer to your day. After caretaking my mom and now my dad I had to learn how to bring my art sketchbooks and writing journals with me to the hospital. This daily habit of just sneaking in creative time lead to published stories and exhibitions. I encourage you to steal whatever time you can for yourself. Julia Cameron\u2019s excellent book \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Way\u201d can help you to re-discover your passions and dreams with practical daily prompts and exercises. Also use the power of the digital age to help you exercise. If you can\u2019t commit to going to the gym or classes you tube workouts are great.  good luck and please invest in yourself you gave your whole life ahead of you and your parents will want you to enjoy it.", "date": "2021-08-01 08:53:12", "user_name": "LeahO71", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/has-anyone-just-lost-the-lust-for-life-468968.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

When my mom journey started 2 years ago I felt the \u201cthis will never end\u201d and I would never return to my short lived retirement fun. My mom is 87. She has Lewy Body Dementia. She went to a Memory Care during the pandemic. Blind faith was required when I dropped her off. She had a full mental collapse\u2026and now she is well enough for an assisted living. That does not take me off the hook. I moved myself to the same retirement community..gave up my condo..sold it and rented an apartment near mom. I am her everything. She depends on me. She is a lady that requires a lot of attention to stay mentally stable. What has changed is I got counseling..I learned how to balance this new world. I learned it is NOT my job to make her happy. It is my job to find a safe place good food warm room and allow her to find friends where she lives..Sounds easy? Nope..it was hard..I cried many days. I worried a lot. Instead of bringing her home I found this great place and I rode out her unhappiness about not living at home. I now schedule my visits\u20263 per week. She knows when she will see me. I encourage my sibling to visit even briefly on days I am not there. Sundays are a full day with church and my apartment for a lunch and chat. Two other days are 2 hr visits. My sibling finds this tiresome and he leaves town a lot to stay at his gal pals home. I am now happy busy and having a personal life again. I advise counseling. I did mine online via Zoom.

I will offer full support of your book and gladly add to it. I will tell you - I learned a lot from the CNA\u2019s that helped care for my mom and a few other amazing individuals but I mostly saw horrific care not only for my mom but by gosh all the people around her \u201cwho had nobody as their voice\u201d - I felt sick for the people who did not have loved ones to watch over them. I saw and heard negligence - I often felt like I was witnessing stuff in a third world country. I\u2019m ashamed of the care provided in my country. You can guarantee that somewhere right now someone or an elder is suffering neglect in a NH or SNF or even a well known hospital.   I am sure some of what you feel is grief but I believe you on witnessing neglectful care. I was with my mom most all times and she still had bruised eggs on her head from someone clearly trying to change her in the middle of the night alone and smashing her head into the railing (because she was dead weight in the beginning after her stroke and a 2 person assist) I also witnessed her fully aspirated with peg tube food all inside her oxygen mask because I had to be the one to tell them \u201cstep one turn the feeding tube off before lying her flat to wash her up\u201d (I learned this in ICU but clearly it was never taught to anyone after that). I had to write it and tape it all over the bed rails - hanging behind the bed etc so before they would press the button to lay flat they would see my sign and this was from hospital to acute care to rehab SNF - 95% of the time I had to say \u201cshut of the food so she doesn\u2019t aspirate\u201d.  If your loved ones level of care is higher then they should never be left alone. The medications given without reading \u201callergies\u201d - or wrong meds given out - my heart really feels your pain - as I don\u2019t doubt for one minute what you went through.  I do want you to know that your mother knew you watched over her - she knew you did everything you could and she without a doubt is at peace now and so proud of you and probably wouldn\u2019t want you to pursue law suits etc. she truly would want you to live and have a good life.  If you are doing something to help find better ways to protect ill or elders and it becomes a passion that you feel you can help someone else or another family or be a change in this horrible system then I fully support you. Just let it come from something good - let it be when you are fully ready and have healed from your grief - do it when you can put your heart in it and feel goodness from it. Don\u2019t let it steal anymore from you - when the time is right - it will feel as if you have a new journey to help others and that\u2019s when you pick up the pen and start writing your heart out \ud83d\udc95.", "date": "2021-11-05 21:46:55", "user_name": "Momheal1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Update on Can I Sue The Nursing Home For Killing My Mother.", "body": "GA hit the nail on the head.   You experienced a sad thing in the loss of your mom. Glioblastoma is a horrible painful cancer that can take a life in weeks if not months. There are not many 'happy endings' to that particular cancer.   You are obviously still deeply grieving--as you say you see people when you go to therapy that you'd like to see people 'dead'--that's not terribly forgiving and comes across very hostile still. You will not get far with your book/legal case if you come across like that.   However--  If you want to write so you can feel some sense of catharsis that's up to you. I imagine you will have a hard time selling something of this nature. Slander and Libel and 2 attorney favorites and you kind of hit on both.   I agree some NH's are nightmares. Nobody would deny that. Did your mom receive the best care possible? We'll never know. But--she would have died of the cancer no matter what you did.   Attorneys will charge a fortune trust me. My son is one and sometimes I am absolutely appalled at the fees he charges. But he is a great attorney and will tell a client if he will represent them and how much it will cost--upfront. $5K is just for the initial consult and discovery. You could easily be charged $50K if this goes any farther and the hospital/ NH has attorneys too. Likely much more.   Personally I would spend more time in therapy and less in trying to place blame. I'm sorry for your loss--but I bet your mother would want you to come to terms with this and move on.", "date": "2021-11-05 19:44:18", "user_name": "Midkid58", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

I remember shortly after he told me his wife made a subtle condescending remark to me. She knew things would go bad. They had it all planned probably for months. Well definitely for a while. What I can't figure out is: Why doesn't he let me asks questions when he tells me what's happening? Isn't that the mature recommended by professionals way to handle these kinds of issues? No. it's not. They want total control.   To be very frank I have been scared all day that my brother was going to pull something like coming over and causing a major scene. Maybe that's overblown. I can be absolutely sure he's steaming mad and it will not go away soon. Probably ever. Right now him and his wife are colluding something that will inflict more pain for me. Friday pizza night? Ha. They will try to torture me.   I hope I'm wrong. All I would say to him is: I agree with your plans. Can you just please listen to what I have to say? You are telling me things.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": ["<p>I'm a 36 year old, only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and, since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7, I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke, so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills, endless phone calls, mountains of paperwork, and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much, and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating. <br>Add to that, I'm really sick of being a caregiver already, and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week, came home for a week, went in for another week, and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother, but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that, but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her, and I feel bad about it. I apologized, but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same. <br>I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues, the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes, the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits, I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy, but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up, having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything, having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot.<br>I'm tired of being trapped in this house, not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule, and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion.<br>I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition, but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984, she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet, and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health, but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried, despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so. <br>The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to, because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings, at home with me. <br>So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own, who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt, crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

Are they refusing to go into assisted living?   perhaps now is the time to put your foot down and stop doing the things that you\u2019ve been doing to enable them to be so dependent on you. Once they realize their needs are not being met maybe they will come to the realization that assisted-living is what\u2019s best for them. You could also tell them that you will not be a part of the situation if the fighting continues. This is not fair to you! I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any easy answer because I\u2019m sure you love your parents and you want to help them. Walking away is probably not the right thing to do either but stepping back a little might be what you need to do.", "date": "2021-12-22 18:43:44", "user_name": "Luluhalls", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/dont-feel-like-doing-this-anymore-471606.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

When I was in my mid-40s their relationship significantly deteriorated and I had to constantly be the referee. It was a horrible position to be in. I swear I still have PTSD from the constant odd phone calls drama falls fights 911 calls. It went on for years. In my case my mom was the aggressor and my dad was beginning cognitive decline. There was also prescription drug abuse and alcohol use (not a good mix for 70 year olds). Anyway I eventually had to place my dad in memory care for his own safety. Mom refused to consider any other option (such as in-home care). It was chaos. I am an only child and there was no one else to step in. I thought my life was over.  I do believe placing my dad in memory care probably caused him to die earlier than he would have. To me the blame is on my mom for that. He died in 2019 after 3 years in the facility. Now I am stuck with her but through some good fortune I was able to get the house sold in 2020 and because of her alcohol relapses she ended up in ER/hospital/skilled nursing/assisted living. Unfortunately the physical &amp; occupational therapists have spent all of 2021 bringing her from wheelchair to rigid walker to rollator and now a cane. Last year at this time she was in a wheelchair in memory care babbling nonsense and now she is walking and wanting to live independently again.  I am not sure me or my marriage will survive another miraculous recovery on her part. I will be 55 in February. I have been stepping in and dealing with their sh*t since 2009.  I agree parents are absolutely not supposed to be like this. I never imagined either one of my parents would end up living a decade or possibly two in such a state. A middle-aged person should not have to sacrifice health career marriage happiness for unending years. This is not the way it was supposed to be. It's not like caring for a child.

I don't know your situation but things didn't improve for me until I told my siblings that I quit. We started working together as a family after that meltdown. It's amazing what can be accomplished if you have help and support from family. If not hire the help and support.  During a discussion we had with an elder care attorney she told us about someone she had on staff. I can't remember the woman's title but the employee would go into the home and evaluate the loved one and then make recommendations for care. She was like a geriatric social worker.   My husband and I have been held hostage for so many years I'm embarrassed to say because neither of us had the gumption to stand up for ourselves.

When I left a VM a real live person the same one multiple times called me back. They have have been great. Yes we got very lucky with an excellent aide who had capacity to take us on as a regular. If this is what you want make this known from the beginning with the agency. We have 3 times per week aide the same one every time for 3 hours a day. She mops the high use areas cleans the bathroom heats the food and makes sandwiches for supper washes the dishes and does the laundry takes out trash and provides them with some outside company and conversation. It is working out very well. She will go buy groceries if needed or pick up take away food too. The cost is less than $30/hr and if your mother has funds it is money well spent. You have to be involved at first. I was in the home when they started I wrote out check lists bought the cleaning supplies and stocked the bathroom and kitchen etc. But once you get a reliable aide with common sense and some experience after a couple of weeks of check lists its smooth sailing.

But do be there when the aides first start coming so you can show them what is expected where things are and give them the low down on the parent - the good the bad and what you really need and expect. So they are not doing things you dont value and you are not always looking over their shoulder.

The regular aides have been great and if/when they can't show the agency calls me direct and they will staff it with someone if at all possible.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Caregiver's cats behaving badly.", "body": "Thank you Send. It was truly more about getting a cat (or a couple of them) out of bro's environment after I saw what the deal was there. He has a very small house and lot and five cats seemed too many for him to care for long-term. Bro said at lunch \"You want a cat?\" and invited me over to meet the cats/Simon. For everyone's sake I would have brought him to my place. And after the first moment of chaos in my home which I figured would happen (but I didn't say that part to bro) he would be taken to a great cat shelter here where kind souls could determine if he's ready for a new home. Simon would probably do best in a one-cat household.   I told my bro this -- that I would \"try\" him and then if it didn't work out I would take him to a well-reputed shelter. I think that's why bro went back on this the next day because he thought I was going to take him to a shelter. He read me right. I had no plans of keeping another cat long term but I was open to it if Lilah and Simon got along.   They seemed like mostly nice cats. Simon reminded me of Divo -- the way he came right up to me for rubs and was sassy to other cats. They all looked clean and healthy and tipped ears indicated they're fixed. Simon didn't hiss/scream at or connect with the other cats just ran them out of his immediate area when they came up. He has a 'tude. lol   He didn't seem like a mean cat that would attack others (my previous roommate's little nightmare was one of those cats and showed it RIGHT away) but was more puffing and flexing on Simon's part... ruler of the roost... big cuddly guy who wants to be the boss. Lilah is mostly shy/sedate and Divo and her clicked in their opposite personalities. I thought I'd try it out based on Lilah's history of being a bonded pair with a similar personality.  But yes. It was to help others and not what I wanted to do.   It was an interesting day. I sat there wrestling with my own feelings of not wanting this responsibility as I petted the cats but I had my way out planned in my mind and figured it would be best for the cats and bro.  *Lilah was feral as a kitten.

Only today we had an example of how a little sympathy goes a long way. My DH was in the garden when one of our neighbours was taking his puppy for a walk. DH explained that Arthur had passed away earlier this week. Our neighbour had known Arthur as he would see him in the fields hunting mice. He was so sympathetic and explained how upset he and his family had been when their much loved other dog had died unexpectedly in his sleep a few months ago and how horrible and overwhelming the loss had been. This was two 50 something men bonding over the grief they'd both experienced unafraid to bare their emotions and I could see that my DH was really comforted by our neighbour's empathy.

My mom passed last month and the finality of her being gone is a tough adjustment; but I would have continued my sacrifice just to have her here. I don't know if you believe in something higher than yourself but I advise that you pray and turn to the word whenever you are feeling stressed resentful angry etc etc. I also advise trying to seek counseling/therapy to help with coping mechanisms while this journey lasts. I had no counsel in the beginning and I was my only help. I cared for my mom from roughly 18-39 years of age and that story in itself is something made for a movie which I won't divulge right now as I'm trying to be brief. In addition to what most of your supporters have mentioned regarding seeking someone to give u a break every week or so if it's financially possible or applying for Medicaid so she can have home health aides with her during the day while you tend to your needs you must also focus on your health and well being. We are consumed when caring for our loved ones that we tend to neglect ourselves. I have had way too much experience with hospitals rehab facilities etc etc. The healthcare system is broken and changes must be made. If your parent requires 24/7 care and help the countless facilities I have experienced will cause a decline in their health. Thank God for his blessings over my strength and patience as I was there from sun up to sundown once I realized the care given is not present so I was pretty much an unpaid worker whenever she was hospitalized or in a facility. Places lack the number of staff needed to help and nurses are overwhelmed with too many patients and when you witness this for over 2 decades it's heartbreaking and the quality of care is nonexistent. If ever you need to talk about the nitty gritty when it pertains to ALL THINGS related to caregiving please reach out. I tended to all my mom's countless needs and as time progressed more issues arose so I was in charge of medication administration feeding tube care tracheostomy care you name it....I was even taught how to give her antibiotics via her pic line at home.

A couple of weeks in she approached the administrator shopping list in hand and asked for directions to the grocery store. Since this isn't his first rodeo he redirected her - successfully he thought. She seemed happy with his suggestions (let us call you an Uber we have a shopping trip scheduled Friday and you could go then etc.) and went back upstairs to her room. Then during the 2 pm staff change meeting when nobody was looking out the door she went and she drove away. She didn't have her phone of course.  Eight hours later and well after dark (she hasn't driven after dark in years) the police were just about to put a vulnerable adult alert out on Twitter with photos of her and the car. My husband was on the phone with adult child #2 filling him in (we didn't want him to find out when his friends said hey isn't that your grandma on Twitter?) when her residence called to say she had breezed back in thanks to a Good Samaritan who had guided her back from the grocery store. Where else she had been she can't say.  The next day I \"stole\" her car. It is in the garage in her house which she still owns. She asks after it wonders why I took it why I hate her etc. I've ordered the police report so with any luck seeing it in black and white will convince her it actually happened.", "date": "2021-12-09 09:18:26", "user_name": "Ambrianne", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/are-you-on-the-naughty-list-471582.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

And it cost $1200 to fix the garage door.  They won\u2019t touch him because of the massive health problems\u2014at least not without significant bloodshed. The only thing they\u2019ll do is throw him in an ambulance to be held at a hospital on a psych hold because he went nuts on the cops \u2014 and then I\u2019m called to take him back home. I tried to get him admitted to the psych ward officially \u2014 and the social worker agreed \u2014 but the doctor said it wasn\u2019t warranted because he\u2019s calm now.  It was literally better if the police hadn\u2019t been called because then I had to bring home an enraged man back to the same house and either leave my mom there with him stay there myself to ensure her safety or bring her to my home.

This has been a very valuable discussion for me as I'm sure for the original poster. My Mom is turning the corner on being 88 and just beginning to exhibit some memory issues and has incontinence issues. She's in excellent health otherwise. I've gotten her health POA and permissions to discuss her care with her GP Medicare etc. She agreed to do this so that I wouldn't have to deal with all that should she get sick. She lives by herself in a house built by her and my Dad. I moved long distance to live near her 6 years ago when my Dad passed away. My husband and I do lots of little things for her and we're happy to do it however she's beginning to let the house fall into disrepair. I had to have a talk with her to let her know that if she wanted to stay in her house she would need to get things fixed. She is financially well off so money is not the issue. I think she gets overwhelmed when there are too many things to take care of so she just ignores some things. I found a handyman to begin repairing and replacing some of the important things like getting one of her door locks replaced because it was broken. She reasons things away like this by saying she lives in a gated community and no one would be able to get in. Ugh! Her front door locks were oxidized and the key would no longer work so those are being replaced too. When I tried recently to get her to have other things fixed she said it was too much too fast. Big argument there so I let it go. I'm going to try again after Thanksgiving. Her memory issues worsened over the summer. It comes and goes. We live in an area where people live here 6 months out of the year (we call them snowbirds). Her friends are returning and she's as happy as a clam. She's been hacked three times and I worry that it's only a matter of time before it happens again and harm is done. (thankfully I caught all three in progress and averted the worst).  Problems with long and\u00a0short-term memory:\u00a0 1. forgetting that's she's already asked the a\u00a0question just\u00a05 minutes later repeats herself. Seems to come and go.\u00a0 2.Often reintroduces me to those I've known for several years. 3.Showed up a day early to pick up friends for dinner another day an hour early.\u00a0 4. Forgets that she's ordered something online or orders an excess of items.  5. Has several piles of mail around the house.  6. Can't keep up with her emails (I have access to that and clean out the spam for her)  7. It's hard for her to make phone calls for\u00a0things that need\u00a0taken care of or fixed. Gets confused as to who's who with vendors. 8. She has items that should have been returned a year ago sitting on her desk.  The list goes on and on. I try hard to help her with all of it but she's resistant and stubborn. The caregiving has barely begun and I'm already frustrated and angry. Thank you all for the advice!

I'm at an age where I absolutely can't quit my job to take care of anyone. My retirement would be ruined. My mom was driving me crazy and I didn't even live with her. She also has a strong personality and refuses everything like a toddler.   I recently put her into a memory care facility. Not every facility is perfect but a lot of these places don't look like the traditional nursing home. My mom has her own apartment and the place looks like a hotel. I would try visiting a few places to get a feel for them yourself. My mom would still prefer to be in her own home but I have peace of mind knowing that she is safe. I felt really guilty for about a month but it really is better for both of us. Even some of her friends have visited and they can see that she hasn't been dumped in some awful place.   I've likened caring for my mom to being a lifeguard trying to save someone.

Even doing everything for them is not altogether torture for me in that giving them a few full-time years of my life to ensure a comfortable ending is still worthwhile to me. I\u2019m lucky to be able to do that. I know that.  It\u2019s that they hate each other and live off this drama that kills me. It\u2019s that they have zero qualms about involving me in this drama of theirs letting \u2014 no demanding and forcing \u2014 their daughter witness the ugliness and misery they cause each other at the end of their lives that just\u2026rots me. It\u2019s truly like a black mold that just spreads and I hate it. That is what I feel \u201cparents\u201d shouldn\u2019t do. I hate that my parents do this and I hate that I let it get this close to us.   I have asked and begged to be left out of it.

She was 85 yrs old when she came here to live in a home just 2 doors away from me. She just gave me the power to take over all her finances and keep the orderly running of her home. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. She was up and down in her health and my life became doctor visits taking her out to places she would enjoy and food shopping for her. I lost my own life completely. If the electric went out during a storm I worried. If we had a blizzard and couldn\u2019t get out I worried. Every minute of every day was thinking about her her bills that needed to be paid her medication refills her congestive heart failure problems her growing breast cancer her taking a shower just everything that a person needs in order to live comfortably. She was able to do so because I gave up everything for her. And I did resent her. She would not have done that for me. Now that she is passed - at age 95 (this past summer) I feel relieved but I am still stuck. I urge you to think about a facility that can care for her at her level of care. This is a situation that will eat you alive. I developed Non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 5 yrs into my caretaking and I know it was due to stress the first years of caring for her. I am still treating. I don\u2019t know how long I have as I am stage 3b and there are only 4 stages. My body could not take the stress of actually taking over someone else\u2019s life.

Please consider doing the next best thing and do not feel guilty. You deserve your life and she will have hers. She may not like it in the beginning but don\u2019t let that sway you.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Might I make a few observations and suggestions.  1 - Your mom's care will be overwhelming if you are the only person caring for her 24/7/365. Burnout is inevitable if you do not get enough \"time off\" to meet your own health needs and social needs.  2 - While I admire your dedication to your mom and her care you are neglecting your own retirement. You need to secure your own financial state first and being with mom second. Nobody can secure your finances or retirement but you.  3 - Everything seems overwhelming. You need to sort out the issues and create a plan. Meeting with a social worker and a counsellor - even televideo meetings can help. The social worker can help you locate and access all the resources available for your situation. A counsellor can help you sort out the emotional overload and create a healthy plan for dealing with your mom.  4 - There are lots of ways that you can work get enough time off and help care for mom. You can not care for her 24/7/365 alone.   a - Ask for help from family friends community of faith and paid help. Some folks will be OK with sitting your mom for a few hours weekly. Others may be able to help with household tasks: housekeeping meals yardwork running errands...  b - if you can not get enough help to care for mom at home then it is time to look at outside resources. Adult Day Care is a Monday through Friday daytime option; they care for mom in a nursing home of private home while you work. Home health aides can also watch mom in your home while you work. Assisted living usually consists of having a private room or suite with home health aides that assist throughout the day. Full care is for those that need frequent care by others. Check to see if mom's insurance and finances will cover any of these services.   c - If mom doesn't have enough finances help her apply for Medicaid. Help her also apply for Medicare and any other public help. You can make an appointment with Social Service. It might help to review their websites and gather all documents needed. If your mom ends up in the hospital again ask social services to help you with these tasks.   d - If mom needs to use Medicaid for help she may be best served in a residential facility that takes Medicaid clients.   A good daughter or son makes sure that their parents are cared for... even if it means you can not do the hands-on care yourself.", "date": "2021-11-18 09:56:23", "user_name": "Taarna", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-new-to-caregiving-and-trying-not-to-drown-in-it-471198.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},
{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Oh goodness. I saw this in my email inbox and I knew that I had to come by and say something. My mom passed away last year. I am 39 years old. And I took care of my mom for 13 years. My mom was 75 much older than your mom but I took care of her from age 25-38. After my dad passed away I was her caregiver.   Listen sweetie. I said the same things as you about how I would never put her in a nursing home and how she didn't want to go anyway.   I miss my mom so much. I burst out crying yesterday because a memory came to me so vividly about her. But there is so much CLARITY now that she is gone. I love her to pieces but she would have been so much better off if at the age of 25 I put her in assistant living. Because at the time she was at least able to walk with a walker and in the beginning I only did things like laundry and cooking and standby assistance for showers. Gradually she got worse took a few falls messed up her back. Became bedridden during the last 6 years of her life.   I was her ONLY caregiver. She did have CNAs coming to bathe her 3 times a week which was helpful but even with that it was a burden. (Ask the doctor to order you this if she has Medicare she should be able to get CNAs to come bathe her). My mom was a fiery woman used to be very independent and always got her way. Very sweet though. She wasn't horrible I'm just saying she was a woman that knew what she wanted. It was... HARD. My brothers off in other states with their family. We had no family here. It was just me. I managed bills her pills her dressing Hoyer Lifts taking her to doctors appointments her dentures her voiding and bowel movements. The whole nine.   I still sometimes here a sound (probably my neighbors) that makes me think its her and I have an urge to jump up and run to see if she needs help. The PTSD-like crap will get to you. I don't even know if it's PTSD. It's something.   Look. I joined a gym and MADE time for myself when I was taking care of my mom. You have to. You HAVE to go on a walk or do yoga. You matter too.   But anyway.... I was saying before... that I have such clarity now. I would have done everything differently. And one thing that I learned... no matter how much your mom says she doesn't want to go to a nursing home the fact is she's just scared.

A few nights later my other neighbor was kept awake by incessant coughing and hacking from next door. The next day he went to that neighbor's house and asked for a ride to the hospital.  No one was allowed to visit after that. The hospital only has that rule around Covid.  I can't say how much caregiver stress had to do with his demise but I didn't observe the masked desperation or isolation I've seen in so many caregivers. This was a social guy who'd ride his bike ran a doggy daycare in retirement and organizes neighborhood golf outings.  SO and I are boostered but in fact did test positive around the same time frame as our neighbor did. We had no symptoms and wouldn't have known had we not tested ahead of a family gathering his immunocompromised mom wanted.   Had this neighbor and us been socializing in one of our houses or at a restaurant I would be consumed with asking myself what if it were me who gave it to him?

{"post_id": "473280", "title": "Dreading when parents move in.", "body": "Good Morning  I grew up in an intergenerational living household. One of four kids stay-at-home Mom Nana lived in an in-law apartment. After Nana's house was sold a small in-law (bedroom/sitting area/full-bath) separate entrance with a patio was built onto our home. Saved a lot of running around for my Mother who would visit \"Nana\" in her house on a daily basis. The small pension wasn't enough to survive and a decision needed to be made.   Absolutely loved my Nana living with us. We were jumping with joy when she moved in. Every night my Nana would sit with my sister the youngest and review her spelling words.   Caregiving is nothing new. Years ago the word \"Assisted Living\" even the word \"Caregiving\" was unheard of. We called it \"taking people in\". Could be Auntie So and So who broke her hip and needed some convalescent. Prior to the apartment the family room would be turned into a makeshift bedroom (a/k/a sleeping on the sofa) the other Nana is coming to live for a while until she decides what she wants to do since Grandpa died. My family has seen it all.  There 's going to be pros and cons. Nana who lived with us paid board--small amount. Mom cooked all the meals but Nana had her own phone tv and bathroom. After supper Nana would retire to her apartment watch the news and settle in for the evening. The added \"board\" gave us some nice \"extras\". For us it was a win-win situation. I never felt alone always had a group around the table and always felt I had someone to talk to. My cousins Aunts and Uncles always visited because Nana lived with us. We were known as \"The Clan\".  My sister-in-law was not happy about \"The Clan\". She grew up having a 20 year span between her only elder sister and herself. So when she was born her sister was already out of the house and married. My brother was forced to make a choice it's me or them she told him. She did not want both but could have. The problems that have stemmed from that were isolation of their children from family events babysitters that were picked out of the newspaper and very low attendance at any of their family celebrations--Communions Graduations Weddings Births. They have no relationship with 1st cousins the way I have and it's a total 360 from the way my brother was raised. Please don't do this to your husband he will get resentful as my brother is but it's cheaper to keep her.  I know it's different today with people \"needing their space\" but overall if you can put up with people's quirky ways I think at least in my home life it was well worth it. My mother was the eldest of 4 the only girl in an Irish family which also means you do everything as I do now for my mother and willingly. There was never a time in my mother's mind where she thought she wouldn't do this and I am of the same mold. I have never abandoned my post. My Mother was a young widow.  In all honesty I don't know of anyone at least in my social circle who can afford Assisted Living. It is extremely expensive to live in the Northeast. The senior housing list is a mile long. You could have a family meeting and set down some ground rules and change things as it goes along. I wouldn't exactly label it \"tell me what you don't like about me\" but more like--lights out at a certain time tv low in the evenings if they take their hearing aids out buy them a headset. A separate phone line is better and decide who takes the mail in etc.   My dad a wonderful man was also going to have his mother move in and add another apartment downstairs. The Mexicans have the right idea. They stick together. You see the children hanging out of the grocery cart with Nana helping out. This is how I was raised just like the Mexican families! \"A strand of (3) cannot be easily broken\". Everyone I knew and this was in the 1980's lived like this. This was my norm and I wouldn't trade it for the world! Amen...

Basically someone has to step to the plate and assure the hospital/facility of a safe discharge. The PCP can write a script for VNA services. In my case I asked the doc to send in the troupes. By that I mean physical therapist occupational therapist nurse home blood draw etc. Whatever your dad's coverage offers.   I found the aluminum gray walkers given out upon discharge make the patient all hunched over eyes to the ground poor posture and breathing as well as sore wrists after a while. One the crutches etc. are put away I would check with p/t about an UpWalker Lite or something similar. You can check out Amazon but have a paper trail (scrip from the PCP) so insurance will cover this.  Everything needs to be modified (the dwelling) before discharge. Your dad is probably going to want a \"male\" wash him a CNA. A shower chair commode all of this is covered under the health insurance you must have a scrip so everything will be covered.  A hospital bed chosen by the p/t or PCP may be needed. Again should be covered by insurance--you need a paper trail. Make sure you have help in hand and that if for some reason brother doesn't keep his word (like in my case) you're not stuck without help. This does happen. Don't be shy and refuse any services that are offered by the insurance.   A lot of this caregiving is knowing the person well and learning along the way books this blog etc. You can put a camera on the door and a text will come up on your phone should something happen. Your phone/internet provider can install this for about $20 per month plus installation.   Shower bars can be installed again medical insurance should cover the bars.

My DH &amp; I visited her twice a week the past 6 months, and at least once a week prior to that, so we had contact with the staff, the facility, saw her apartment, the grounds, knew what was going on, for the most part, it's safe to say. What we did not realize was the quality of care she was getting or how happy she was in general. To hear mom tell it, she was sad &amp; lonely, miserable &amp; praying to God to let her die. That's the message she saved for me and for her niece in New York, which made us feel terrible, when she'd ask us to 'pray for me to die', or accuse us of not praying 'hard enough' because she was still alive. I lived with a constant low-level of guilt &amp; a feeling of not being a good enough daughter due to mom's chronic complaining about everything from the food to the weather to the lack of activities in the MC. No matter that I (nor anyone else) could NEVER reach her on the phone for her being busy in the activities room.</p>", "<p>What I learned while sitting with her for many hours each day for an entire week was that the caregivers went out of their way to shower mom with love &amp; affection &amp; attention. They came into her room every 20 minutes to see what she needed; to kiss her forehead &amp; tell her they loved her. Some stayed AFTER their shift ended to sit with her! They'd pull up a chair and sit next to her bed, hold her hand, and recount stories of the time they'd spent together. There was a constant stream of CGs &amp; other staff in and out of her room for an entire week. When going through her things, I found dozens and dozens of handwritten cards from former caregivers that had quit and moved away; they wrote mom cards to let her know how they were doing! Or if they'd gotten married or had a baby! To let her know they were thinking of her and missed her. One gal named Angelica told me she was honored to know mom at the end of mom's life and at the beginning of HER life, b/c she would carry her memory with her for life. The testimonies I heard were mind boggling.</p>", "<p>As it turned out, mom was always positive, upbeat, smiling &amp; happy as a resident in Memory Care (and in AL before that). She was the cheerleader for all the residents! Always the first in line for the activities and to encourage the others to join in! Who knew? Not I, that's for sure.</p>", "<p>This was the woman who made my life so difficult on every level for 64 years. Led me to believe she was so unhappy and sad in Memory Care in spite of me KNOWING she was well cared for, fat &amp; happy. I could never get her to admit it , not even once, in the nearly 3 years she lived there. I did everything humanly possible for the woman to make her life as comfortable as possible, and I succeeded, I just didn't KNOW it until I witnessed the testimony from the staff during the last week of mom's life.</p>", "<p>And I got a call from the Assistant ED the other day, telling me that the trail of emails that went back &amp; forth after the staff was notified of mom's passing was THE most incredible thing she'd ever witnessed. The communication between the Assisted Living bldg and the Memory Care bldg was huge, all the caregivers &amp; nurses expressing their sadness at her passing, and offering condolences.</p>", "<p>For those who feel 'guilt' at having their loved on in residential care, just take heed. Things aren't always what they appear to be.</p>", "<p>Rest in peace, mom.

They warned her about going out and getting half-baked so she wouldn't get accidentally mashed and get a bad name for herself like 'Hot Potato' and end up with a bunch of Tater Tots. Yam said not to worry no Spud would get her into the sack and make a rotten potato out of her! But on the other hand she wouldn't stay home and become a Couch Potato either. She would get plenty of exercise so as not to be skinny like her Shoestring Cousins. When she went off to Europe Mr. and Mrs. Potato told Yam to watch out for the hard-boiled guys from Ireland . And the greasy guys from France called the French Fries. And when she went out West to watch out for the Indians so she wouldn't get scalloped. Yam said she would stay on the straight and narrow and wouldn't associate with those high class Yukon Golds or the ones from the other side of the tracks who advertise their trade on all the trucks that say 'Frito Lay.' Mr. and Mrs. Potato sent Yam to Idaho P.U. (that's Potato University ) so that when she graduated she'd really be in the Chips. But in spite of all they did for her one-day Yam came home and announced she was going to marry Tom Brokaw. Tom Brokaw! Mr. and Mrs. Potato were very upset.

But she still got up and came to the family room until her very last day. I feel I was in denial that it was actually happening, and then happening so fast.

She's being kept comfortable by hospice, who's been marvelous since they accepted her in late December.

Had you really never before thought of whether or not you could care for an elder in your home? If not then the time is here now.  So tomorrow bright and early you call the Nurse Manager and the Social Worker in charge of Dad's care. You tell her this:  \"Gee I am so sorry but I had never considered caring for my Dad in my home and on a phone call I got it kind of sprung on me and I answered yes. Now I need to tell you there are utterly NO CIRCUMSTANCES under which I could care for my Dad in his home. So now we need to get together on placing Dad for his own safety into in= facility rehab and then assess as we go as to whether Dad can go back home or must go to Assisted Living or some other level of care; I depend upon you to find the best placement you can during this discharge planning period. Sorry I misled you; Dad was always so vital and off skiing and I just never thought about this before.\" You can see it will do not good to tell US you can't do this. I couldn't either; not for a single second. You must tell THEM so they can begin planning for his rehab and deciding what level of care he needs. Now as to his care. Whatever insurance then assets your Dad has will go to pay his expenses for his care until those assets are gone. If he has a wife there will need to be division of their assets so that Dad will have his own portion to spend without robbing all of MOM'S money. If Dad owns a home the home will not have to be sold for his care unless that's how he wishes to do it (or his POA if he has dementia and has a POA). There will be \"clawback\" by the government to pay for Dad's care after his death should he need now to enter care ( when/if the home is sold.) That is to say the home will have a lien on it. Other than that the POA or the state if they have guardianship will apply for medicaid. The taxpayer will pay. Yes. That is what the taxpayer picks up the care costs for those who have run out of their own savings. As to what we pay taxes for???? I was an RN all my life and made quite good money and was proud and happy to pay my taxes. When I retired early at age 62 I began to collect Social Security. I am now 80. While I paid a whole lot of taxes guess what the Government in these last many many years has repaid me all of that and MORE. So figure it out. I am now using YOUR tax money as well.  My Dad has a saying about taxes and insurance. It was \"Let me pay a whole lot of taxes and let me get a whole lot of insurance and let me hope someone ELSE needs it and I stay healthy and without any monitary help for my needs\". I feel the same. I doubt they called you to DUMP (as you say) Dad. I think more they wanted to sincerely know if you were that rare one with the courage to attempt to take on elder care with in home rehab with the WISH to do so.  You aren't.  That's just fine. Either am I. I loved nursing but doing it 24/7? Nope. So on you go now. Get in touch with Social Worker and Nurse Manager and Discharge Planner and lay down the law as to what you will not do. They will ask you who is POA and who is familiar with Dad's finances if he cannot discuss that himself so they can get him the very best care his money can buy. Do know that he will have at least 20 days of rehab at medicare cost to get his ADLs and mobility going. Time will tell. I wish you the best and your Dad as well. Hope he recovers well and is soon back on his feet. Sounds like he was real active if this was a ski accident. A month of rehab and he may be right back at his near normal level.

You saw the changes but I bet your mom would not have wanted you to change a routine that had been so much a part of her life and yours for 10 years.  You should have no regrets and absolutely no guilt. You did an amazing job you were a loving caring daughter.  I know what you mean about the quiet. The morning the Funeral Home came to take my Husband and I shut off the bed I could not believe how quiet the house was. I actually turned the bed back on later and slept in it just to hear the \"noise\". For months I would wake up at the same time I did for 5 years to check on him change him and make sure he was not tangled up in sheets. (and to see if I needed to change the sheets as well) For a long time I would check my watch to see if I had time for 1 more thing before I had to get back before the caregiver had to leave...only to remember that there was no caregiver that I had to get back for.  All that passes.  The difficult thing now is to find your \"New Normal\" and to find out who you are now that you are no longer a full time caregiver. Rediscovering yourself finding out who you and your husband are as a couple.   Forget what I call the \"Wouldacouldashoulda\" you can not change what was you can only move forward.   Your mom is still with you. I bet there are times when you see her in the mirror when you laugh you hear her laughter. When you see your kids there is a bit of here there as well. She is gone physically but she is still with you.   I will leave you with this I have this taped to my wall right in front of me now...

Like my mother she got up and got dressed every day went into the activities room at her Memory Care ALF and was the cheerleader for others. I marveled at how she could DO that day in &amp; day out at 95 years old with more issues than Newsweek. Yet she did. Until one day she went to bed and became unresponsive and died exactly one week later. Without much 'warning' either. But the way I look at it she lived life to the best of her ability right to the very end. And so did YOUR mother.   You didn't miss anything nor were you in 'denial'. Your mother played the game of life beautifully until she could play it no longer. She was loved and cared for by you and your family and she felt that love on a daily basis. Stop beating yourself up for what you 'didn't' do or what you 'missed' and realize this: Mom didn't want you to know she was fading away as my mom didn't want anyone to know SHE was fading away. They lived life to the fullest until they couldn't anymore then God took them Home as mercifully as possible.  It's okay to cry and to feel the loss that mom's absence has made in your life. It's not okay to feel guilty for something you 'should have' or 'could have' done but didn't.

Your mom would not want you now crying over theses things. Instead she would want you to focus on the fact that you were able to live with and care for her and give her the best quality of life possible under her health circumstances. That should bring you great peace and joy.  And know too that feeling a sense of what do I do now that I don't have someone to care for is quite normal for us caregivers. I cared for my husband for many years and after he died I wandered around my house for months wondering what it was I was supposed to be doing now. He too was on oxygen for the last 22 months of his life and I had to get used to the quiet in my house after he passed without the oxygen concentrator running but I can tell you now that I really enjoy the quiet in my house especially first thing in the morning. So give yourself time. You will adjust to what will now be your \"new normal\" and allow yourself time to grieve and remember the many good things about your mom and that how very blessed you were to have a mom that you actually wanted to care for and have in your home.

It's like the flu vaccine when they take an educated guess as to which variant will be the dominant one in any given year. If they guess incorrectly the flu vaccine will be effective albeit less so than the variant for which it was developed.   Deaths for India or Africa are poorly documented because testing isn't done with any real frequency so no one really knows how much the virus has affected the populations. They've reported about half a million deaths but in reality it's thought that they've had closer to three million. The same goes for their reported numbers of cases -- they're far far below reality. (All that information is easily found from reputable sources.)  Yes in the end it's a personal choice. What's unfortunate it the \"ain't no one going to tell me what to do\" attitude that so many use to defend a choice that can ultimately end in your own death. It makes absolutely no sense. If it only hurt the person with that attitude I'd have no problem with that Darwinian decision but so many children are being deprived of parents and grandparents long before their time should be up.

{"post_id": "473282", "title": "My unvaccinated next-door neighbor is now dead.", "body": "In the last 3 months I've known 3 people who died from covid. All were unvaccinated all had underlying conditions such as diabetes prior smoking obesity. Sometimes I think men wait too long to seek medical help (this is a generalization) and then show up in the ER already too far gone for treatments to be effective. Who knows: maybe your neighbor might have been a smoker in his teens until quitting at 40 but still long enough for permanent lung damage to have occurred. He may have been in denial about his risk level.  Then there's my husband: 64 unvaccinated and has not even been sick since 2019. He went on a missions trip to Turkey this past December and had to have PCR tests before traveling there and back but in Turkey spent a lot of time without a mask and among many unvaccinated people. It's not that he was sick at some point in the past few years and didn't get tested - he has not been sick period. I got original covid in March 2021 got the Pfizer vaccine in July then (probably) got Omicron in early December (but didn't bother to get tested because there was no point). My eldest son (age 31 also unvaccinated and a smoker) has been mildly sick but never tested. His own elementary-aged son has had covid.   I think some people have some sort of natural immunity and I think some people have the opposite: an unknown biological Achilles heel when it comes to covid. We are all on a spectrum. Just like some people have a reaction to the vaccine enough that it kills them but this is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless it has happened.   In May 2020 my MIL in LTC got original covid and was at death's door. Went on hospice and then had a rapid and full recovery. Her only underlying health condition was being 85. She was overweight at 185 and 5'6\". Nine other people on her floor died during that outbreak.   This morning I was power walking with my friend in the Mall of America (a gigantic mall). She has 2 twin grandsons who were born at 23 weeks and are now 15 months old but have compromised lungs and too young for the vaccine. My friend still has to follow rigid protection protocols if she wants to babysit her grandsons. It is very hard on her and her husband (because they still mostly socially isolate and don't dine out) and she has no idea when she can drive in a car with another person or stop wearing 2 masks while mall walking 6 feet away from me. Even if everyone else was following her protocol she would still be doing it too because she wouldn't want to risk the lives of her grandsons or not ever see them in person. So the wisest philosophy is to let everyone live as they choose and if you're someone at risk then you have to do what you must to protect yourself.   No one should be telling anyone else how to manage their health. Your neighbor had every right to reject the vaccine. Freedom isn't free because there are consequences to the choices we make. Everyone needs to calculate their own risks and live accordingly.", "date": "2022-02-24 13:42:30", "user_name": "Geaton777", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/my-unvaccinated-next-door-neighbor-is-now-dead-473282.htm"},

Well, since then we tried to get several attorneys, everyone seemed like they wanted a $5.000.00 fee because they where not sure wether they could win or not. Then my brother had a serious discussion with me; he said that our mom would not want us to sue anybody. I was very angry with the nurses and doctors that I felt took my moms life to soon. Well, the long and short was there was never a law suit because my brother convinced me that they did everything they could, even-though some aspects of that I would have to strongly disagree with, but I did get some grief counseling with my sister and it helped tremendously. I had a serious problem because my grief had me going to a place where I truly wanted to see some people not living anymore, yes, I mean the nursing home staff and some of the doctors, but I worked through all of that, I had to go to some pretty intense therapy sessions before I just had to let that go and just be at peace with the fact that my mom was no longer in pain with that brain tumor. It was called a Gleioblastoma one of the most aggressive tumors that there are. I am however writing a book called \"The Dangers of Hospitals and Nursing Homes\" to make people more aware of thigs like what are they really getting themselves into, and stuff like about how they are going to become the \"Enemy Number One\" if they are there most of the time to watch out for their loved ones, and exposing what the care in a nursing home is really like. I am doing this post pandemic, and I will mention that in the preface of my book. I want it to get into the hands of people that have put their loved on into a nursing home or, had to do it because they had no other choice. I am going to sell it, send it to talk shows, news stations, etc... etc... etc... I want everyone to know the kind of crap they will pull if they can get away with it. For example, there where Nurses Aids that would literally hide from us when we needed to get their help. There was an inspection from the nursing homes higher ups and they where literally told to avoid the inspectors if the came their way. They told them to go the other way. I got charged for co-pays after my mothers death that they where not suppose to charge after her death. When a person dies they are no longer responsible for any bill that that loved one had, there was a guy stealing out of the nursing home patients funds that the family's put in for the patients so they had some money for themselves, he invested it in football tickets and sold it to other people at a huge markup. He got arrested and killed himself in jail. I didn't get to take them to court but I am going to expose them to the public so they cant hurt anybody else.</p>"], "date": "2021-11-05 01:53:11", "user_name": "trapwhisk", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Elder Abuse", "End of Life", "Grief"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-on-can-i-sue-the-nursing-home-for-killing-my-mother-471013.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

Super stubborn and has said for years that she never wants to move. No longer drives (because I anonymously reported her to DMV because she was getting lost) and therefore relies on me for groceries, Dr's appts, etc. I'm an only child, single mom, who is doing the best she can to help from across town but it's become super stressful to manage. Got her to sign POA a few months ago before her conditioned worsened.</p>", "<p>Today I took her to neurology appt (her 2nd) where the neurologist and I both let her know for about 30 minutes that it was unsafe for her to live alone and that is was crucial for her to move. She was a little testy during the appointment because she felt ganged up on, but we let her know that we are just trying to help her because often those with dementia can't see what others see. We let her know that after this appointment we had a 2nd appointment to go visit an assisted living facility. Unbeknowst to her, earlier in the week we had already been there (under the guise of testing for her primary care doctor) where they had done the initial assessment and SLUMS test. That way they could determine if she was assisted living vs dementia resident. At the assisted living appointment we had same conversations with her, but also did a tour of the facility and specific rooms. We sold it under the guise that her doctor set this up because she's worried about her weight loss, her nutrition, socialization and brain health. She'd be on a \"30 day program\" and we could evaluate it after the 30 days and see if she'd like to renew. This way it makes her feel that she has some agency in the decision overall and that she can leave after the 30 days if she likes (it's month to month, so it's not entirely a fabrication). We just stayed with the conversation until we got a yes. She seemed to really like the fact that it was month to month and that this program could help her brain and help her feel better (which is SO true because she'll be eating, drinking water and socializing at the very least).

Propaganda like this feeds the mentality that the only solution is to be a caregiver at home no matter what the cost mentally emotionally or physically\u2014and sometimes a combination of these. Doctors did a study and found that caregivers had a 63% higher mortality rate than others given similar variables. Were you ever a caregiver at home? If not you have no idea of what it takes to take care of someone especially with glioblastoma. Where would you have taken her if not a nursing home? You don\u2019t even mention what ways you think were detrimental to her. It doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re providing an alternatives so there\u2019s nothing constructive about this book. It\u2019s already common thinking that nursing homes are bad so why spread a generalization as truth?   At 65 my brother was diagnosed with glioblastoma. He needed 24/7 care. I found an excellent nursing facility on the Medicare website and placed him there along with getting hospice care. He\u2019s been there nine months and they\u2019ve both provided wonderful care. There was an inspection and his case was chosen to be examined. His tumor greatly affected his judgement impulsivity problem solving and his personality. It\u2019s evident that my brother is loved and cared for. Recently it looked like his death was eminent. For people upset because their loved one isn\u2019t being fed hospice explained to us that because his body is starting to shut down so he doesn\u2019t need much food if any. They lose the ability to swallow so feeding runs the risk of inhaling food and causing pneumonia. He\u2019s rallied some but now he\u2019s at the point where his brain says to get up but his legs are weak so he falls. Sometimes he refuses the meds that would calm down this activity. They can\u2019t force him to take them. Fortunately he\u2019s five feet from the nurses station so they can keep a closer eye on him. It\u2019s driving the nurses crazy because they want him to be safe but they can\u2019t restrain him and can\u2019t post an aide there 24/7. Obviously they care and worry about him.   So yes there are bad nursing homes\u2014I removed him from a previous one. But don\u2019t do a blanket smear job. Nursing homes are short on staff.

Dishonesty is often a NECESSITY where dementia is concerned as many of us know who have been down this road for years with elderly parents. Most of them won't believe us anyway so why go there? If a person is 60 and in full capacity of her mind then perhaps an \"honest\" talk is required. For those of us with 90 year old or older mother's who have no coping skills or mental capacity to begin with telling them they have dementia is cruel. I always told my mother she had memory issues AND mobility issues that caused her to move from regular AL into their Memory Care building after she became wheelchair bound. One time her doctor spoke to her about \"dementia \" and she had a meltdown. She always insisted the other residents were \"stupid\" and had issues but she was fine. She was entitled to her delusions.  Same thing with those who insist you be totally \"honest\" with your demented mother when she keeps asking where the dead relatives are. If you tell her they're dead she gets to relive that trauma each time you \"break the news\" which could be daily! Speaking of cruelty! We use what's called therapeutic fibs to deal with dementia patients because the whole goal is to keep them happy and anxiety free as much as humanly possible. The vast majority of material you read on the subject will back this up.   How you handle this situation is up to you of course. If you feel like your mother can handle hearing she has a dementia diagnosis and it will serve some useful purpose to tell her so then do it. Otherwise tell her she's aging and having some Memory problems as a result and needs more care. Give her as many choices as possible so she doesn't feel like you're taking away her liberties unnecessarily.

She stayed in her room all the time at the skilled nursing facility but in the memory care they got her up and dressed every day brought her out to the common room and treated her like she was perfectly fine . That did wonders for her mental health I think.  Bottom line I think you have to decide what the value is in telling her. Will it make her feel better? Will she take the news relatively well? Will it improve her life in anyway?   If none of those are a yes I\u2019m not sure telling her is necessary.

Throughout the next two years we discussed EVERYTHING. He got nothing but better with the burdens of daily living off him. A private person it wasn't easy to adjust to assisted living but he did and said \"You knowhon it's a bit like when I was in the Army. I didn't LIKE it but I DID make the best of it\". We discussed his hallucinations. I lived at one end of the state and he at the other but I visited. At first he thought he couldn't write but later he still could. He regained balance with PT help. Until he died surprisingly of sepsis he held his own. Much of this was due to scrupulous honesty and gentle acceptance that this was never a place we wanted \"to go\" but that there was no choice.

(she was in any case all her life an extremely smiley person; always laughing). the facility was super clean caring.  i visited a friend\u2019s dear parent in a facility in croatia. awful!! very sad. but there was no choice. my friend can\u2019t keep her mother home. (i\u2019m not saying all facilities in croatia are bad).  \u2014on the other hand in some cases keeping a LO home is the best thing to do!   it\u2019s so case-specific. \u2026where you live (town/city\u2026) \u2026how much money you have \u2026how old is the helping adult child \u2026how difficult is the LO \u2026what does the LO want \u2026etc.  \u2014\u2014\u2014 i personally am not against - all - facilities in the world.  i\u2019m against the facilities where i live (when i say \u201cwhere i live\u201d i don\u2019t mean my entire country. i mean where i live).   but even if the facilities would be great i would do all i can to keep my parents home. but that\u2019s because in my case it\u2019s possible. we can hire caregivers. and my parents are extreeeemely happy at home.  if absolutely necessary my parents are absolutely willing to go to a facility. none of us in our family say \u201cnever\u201d. we know there are many factors. unexpected factors can come up.  \u2014\u2014\u2014  it\u2019s amazing to read on this website all the love people give their LOs (whether in a facility at home whatever).  you can feel so much love.  you can also feel the huge challenges many of us face in this rollercoaster of emergencies/helping our (kind or mean) LOs.  \u2014\u2014\u2014  hugs! one step at a time.  :) don\u2019t sacrifice your ONE life health\u2026  live a full life!!! :) :) :) don\u2019t wait for someone to rescue you.  bundle of joy :)", "date": "2022-03-01 15:57:31", "user_name": "bundleofjoy", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/update-mother-with-mid-stage-dementia-agreed-to-assisted-living-heres-how-473310.htm"},

It may or may not be.  I don't think it is. Think it may have been worded better though. It's not necessarily related to *abuse* of the system. Fees/charges can happen on the first call in some areas.  Most of you maybe 99%? live where fees like this will never happen. Count your blessings.  Some of us - on the other hand unfortunately live in areas in the USA where Medics DO charge high fees for lift assists and also for calls in which the patient declines transport.   For example where we live - the fee for an ambulance that is dispatched and cancelled after making contact with a patient who refuses care has gone up to $300.00 this year per incident. Even if it is the very first time you called 911 in your life. If you choose to decline the services - you are billed. And insurance will not pay.  The cost of a simple lift and assist (not for repeat people either) this will happen on your first call - is presently $175 this year. Insurance will not pay either.  Don't know if this will be a trend. I hope not. But it makes life much harder on us Caregivers.  I used to live in a city where we had to pay a fee each year or else any call involving medics/fire department resulted in very large bills. We happily paid the fee each year and we never once had to use their services back then. I think that is an excellent solution to paying higher fees for service.  Editing to add: That if the OP means the charges are a punishment for 911 *abuse* that is not how it works. Legally. However some agencies are indeed charging high amounts for services that are cancelled and lift assists.", "date": "2022-02-18 17:42:32", "user_name": "LavenderBear", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/fyi-because-of-the-abuse-of-the-911-system-for-lift-assists-some-fire-and-ambulance-districts-will-s-473135.htm"},

By the end of the day there is a feeling of calmness and love that is all encompassing. Why not try it?

Don\u2019t be discouraged for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. Isaiah 41:10  Give me strength and patience O God that I may be as loving gentle and patient with others as you have been with me. Through Jesus my Lord and hero I pray. Amen.  For I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength. Philippians 4:13  Don\u2019t worry about anything; instead pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done.

My brothers and sisters think my mom might take advantage of me because I used to always do everything for her and anything she wanted I got her!!! So that being said, today she looks at ME while we just arrived in the NH and said to me, \"I cannot belive you all took me here you told me you wouldn't. You are all abandoning me.\" And when she is telling me this, my heart is breaking into millions of pieces!!! I ALMOST threw up. I looked at her and said, \"Mom we do not know if you will be here forever.\" We are trying to get her into assisted living, but her mobility is not quite back. She has come a long way, but we want to see with PT if she can go further with her strength. So after I told her that, she replies, \"I am so disgusted with you all!!!!\" So in my head I am saying what the hell? It's all about her, my mother!!! THE ONE I love and adore. I mean, my siblings and I are doing everything trying to find her a nice place that's safe and clean with good people!!! THIS is her first day. It seemed nice, but I am praying she will get a little used to it. I am preparing myself to get a phone call tonight about her. So that being said I have great support. My brother and sister have been so good to me. ACTUALLY they worry about me alot because I am very close to my mom and I helped her a lot more than they did. Right now after today I am feeling burnt out!!!! SO they told me to take a step back and worry about me. So as I was leaving her at the nursing home tonight, she kept saying to me, \"Put me in the room, I might have to pee.\" She wears diapers but she does not pee or anything in them (which is ok) so she needs someone to help her to bathroom. So she said to me like 5 times, \"I hope these people come get me so I can go to bathroom.\" I said, \"Yes, mom, they will.\" She starts complaining again (BUT let me tell you, my mother was always negative always). So that being said we are used to her complaining blah blah blah!! UGH sorry but today has been a hellllll of day!! I am tired, burnt out, and I am numb. So as she is complaining to me, I feel so bad and guilty but at the same time my mother is not understanding that we are doing and trying everything for her !!!</p>"], "date": "2022-03-11 17:34:49", "user_name": "Happy16", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Burnout", "Care Decisions", "Guilt", "Skilled Nursing Facility"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/we-put-mom-in-a-nursing-home-and-i-feel-so-sad-leaving-her-there-473575.htm"},

The local diner served the same kind of meals we'd get at home with the addition of deep fried things like french fries and battered fish which made eating out special.   Hamburgers and hot dogs were usually served as is and eaten with a fork putting them on a bun with a handful of potato chips on the side was special.  We like visits to my grandmother's house because she always had bottles of pop on hand and popsicles. You broke the popsicles in half to share and the pop was poured in a glass and shared too. Oh and her grilled cheese was the best because she used Kraft cheese slices instead of cheddar like my mom did \ud83d\ude02  Summer sausage and bologna were household staples and bought by the piece from the local butcher we raised chickens and ducks and arranged to buy a half of beef at the abattoir since we didn't raise hogs pork was bought in town and was more of a special treat.", "date": "2022-03-05 09:54:13", "user_name": "cwillie", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/what-are-some-untypical-food-dishes-that-your-family-served-growing-up-473212.htm"},

I think for the 1950's-60's in New England... at least none of my friends ever heard of this \"stuff\" My Grandma lived with us and she would cook these are some of the things I recall her making.  Shrimp Pilaf  \"Welsh rarebit\" was another my Grandma made quite a bit.  Creamed Finnan Haddie (Oh I wish I could find smoked Haddock now!) And I recall she would mash her peas into the mashed potatoes. She said it made them stay on the fork better.  And occasionally she would make an avocado salad for herself with a bit of Thousand Island dressing on it (Or French if I remember correctly) On Fridays if we had pancakes for dinner my Mom would sprinkle hers with sugar then squeeze lemon juice over them. I still eat pancakes this way and will do the same with a waffle. When my sister and I were little we had a place in Florida and when we went to the beach Mom would pack a lunch COLD tomato soup and cheese sandwiches. Don't think anyone I knew ever had cold tomato soup. And to this day I do not know how my mom and grandma made a particular dressing for our Thanksgiving and Christmas it was the regular bread cube dressing but it was dry so it soaked up a lot of gravy!   And once just once my mom got it into her head that she would make beef tongue. Bless he heart...she tried. probably would have been better if she did the following 1. Cooked it longer so it was tender.  2. Removed the bumpy outer portion  3. Fed it to the dog! Thanks for the memories.  Oh side note... I lost my Mom Dad and Grandma at a pretty young age.

I over think it too sometimes!!! Back to my calming motto: one day at a time!! Love yourself too! Mom is lucky to have you! You deserve a pat on the back and time to pamper yourself!

Is it really that hard think that tye stresses of a poor paying job among other stresses should not be considered when it comes to what conditions contribute to a certain horrible outcome?   I never stated a poor job in itself was the the sole cause many factors are at play. Also the things around Epstien are also far more complicated. He was a fixer for the rich and powerful they had problems or desires he helped facilitate a solution. We will never know the full truth around his situation.   Weinstien was a unattractive man with enormous power and authority in Hollywood. I am sure he had his own demons and issues that led him to use and abuse females and led him to believe women are nothing more than objects.   As I said many factors are at play a poor paying dead end job are some factors people face that lead them to do wrong things. It does not mean it is a factor for everyone I get it trust me I do. It not easy to admit that stagnant wages increased poverty limited options poor living conditions can potentially be a contributing factor that leads people to a comit crime. Cause it is not a problem we can easily fix and it also undermines all the upstanding individuals that never have even entertained the idea of doing wrong because of their circumstances. It also could be seen as not taking personal responsibility or accountability for one's actions but that is not nesscaryly the case.   We really should not undermine how factors lead up to an action.

There are many poor and decent people in the world. There are many wealthy and evil people. And vice versa. Again I give you the VERY WEALTHY Epstien and Weinstein. Were they BORN evil?

{"post_id": "473510", "title": "Anyone hear about the 23-yr-old aide who raped dementia patients in Ohio?", "body": "Agree to disagree I do not think people are born evil more so they are a product of a series of choices and events in their life that have reached a boiling point and snap.   As mentioned I agree not everyone who had a sh*t life / living a sh*t life or has no prospects turns sour so to speak. What I am saying is that it certainly does not help matters and does add to whatever issues they have faced or face before.   I am not making excuses for such people but I am not shocked if someone who has no control in their life for whatever reason feels the need to or desire to try and take control one way or another. I do feel it is safe to assume most people who live grinding work life and have all sorts of problems will not even entertain the idea.   Just like I am not shocked if someone who has not eaten in days makes the choice to steal some food.  Though to say such factors do not have the potential to add up and push someone over the edge is a tad disingenuous.  I mean I have no evidence to show a relation between income employment status type of employment living situation and the relation to crime. To be frank most likely will not look it up but I also do not believe people are inherently evil so to speak. Since I believe that does mean I believe something has to lead up to cause a person to commit great harm to another.   I have a clinic diagnosis of ASPD in short I am a true sociopath they do not us the term sociopath anymore. I have been battling this since I was a kid. I know I can go from zero to hundred in a fraction of a second. As my therapist has told life is aculmination of choices we make or are made for us. Sometimes people focus on the choices that were not made for us such as skin color type of family you were born into environment you were born into etc... verse the choices we have control over. Like how much effort you put into your school work if you willfully get into drugs.  In short some people make excuses for their short comings and blame the system and everyone else around them for their lives they live or they take personal responsibility and do something about it. That being said as they told me we cannot dismiss the concerns of elements outside of our control and how they can lead to choices are 100% in our control but do not see it as such.   It is hard to let go of the baggage and I am pretty sure all these people that do horrible acts have baggage they cannot let go of. Not making excuses but I am also not going to dismiss it either. I live it I easily could have gone down the route to doing something horrible growing up even now I always walk on a razors edge. I was lucky enough to get help early on and have been able to live a somewhat functional life because of it. My family was also upper middle class if they were not. Who knows what would have happened.   It sucks not feeling like you have options or control of your life and when you have no support it is easy to give into vile actions. It is easy to hurt someone or something when you yourself feel you have nothing to lose or no one that cares for you.

I worked for several different care agencies over the years and only one asked for a criminal back round check from the police department of the town I lived in for the last five years. That was easy because I live in the town I was born in. They still hired people who had criminal records though. None of it will ever get any better as long as the greed of the 'old age industry' is allowed to continue to operate as it is with no threat of consequences.

We has her family feel nursing home is not where we want to take her. Please help and let me know some different resources places that they have elderly care where she can live. I appreciate information.\"  So your post is a bit confusing when compared to your profile. Is mom in the SNF for rehab or there permanently for the long term?  In either event give her time to ADJUST. When given an ear to complain into that's what she WILL do: COMPLAIN. She's nervous and worried about what to expect moving forward and will try laying a guilt trip on you so you'll feel sad and get her out of there. Which is a mistake b/c you placed her in the SNF for her own safety care and well being.  Your siblings gave you good advice when they told you to take a step back from this situation &amp; worry about YOURSELF for now. Mom is safe and you can worry about her later on. For now relax have a glass of wine and remember WHY you placed her to begin with.   Old age is hard especially when it's combined with disease mobility problems and ailments. We'd all like to be 85 with the body &amp; mind of a 20 year old but that's not how it works for the majority of us. If we had our druthers we'd all like to stay home forever 'age in place' or have millions of dollars to bring in whatever caregivers we'd need to insure we COULD stay in our own homes till death. But then reality sinks in &amp; forces us to realize that's not going to happen. So we have to cope and make the best of the deck of cards we're dealt. You didn't create this situation for your mother; life did. Life happened to her and you're trying to help her in reality which she will hopefully see one of these days.

Spreading misinformation about end-of-life care is unhelpful but posts like these are delicate. Sadly some people do not fully understand the purpose of hospice care what it entails or how it benefits patients and their families. The dying process can be difficult to witness even for those of us who have cared for loved ones in their final days and recognize the value of hospice. Acceptance of loss does not always come easily and grief can trigger new or worsening mental health issues in some. \u00a0 This post has not been removed and I'll explain why. I strive to use a light hand while moderating. We're all adults here. Although some stories and details may come across as shocking or nonsensical my job is to enforce forum guidelines to the best of my ability while also fostering open communication. \"Believability\" does not factor into moderating unless a post violates some other aspect of AgingCare's comment policy. \u00a0 Maintaining a healthy sense of skepticism is crucial these days especially online. It's up to each of us to decide whether certain details a member provides are real perceived or fabricated. In the same vein deciding which posts and users to interact with is entirely up to you. Your contributions to this forum are invaluable. Please continue reporting posts that you believe violate our policies but don't waste your precious time and energy drawing attention to something you deem unworthy for whatever reason(s). \u00a0 Lastly I do have one respectful request: please refrain from decrying other members as trolls. Disruptive individuals are an unfortunate and inescapable of part of this digital age. Whether such an assessment is accurate doesn't matter. What does matter is that this labeling can and does discourage other legitimate people from seeking information advice and support here which is the purpose of this forum after all. \u00a0 I hope this clarifies our stance on this post and the process by which all forum content is approved edited or removed.

I visit my mother 3-4 times a week and each time she sees me she says \"I'm so surprised to see you\". This is interpreted by me as \"where have you been; you are neglecting me\".

{"post_id": "473390", "title": "An essay on navigating a loved one's journey through Alzheimer's", "body": "Hi Darren I read your article thank you for sharing. I'm so sorry for the loss of your dear father to Alzheimer's. I lost my mother on 2/22/22 to dementia so I know how you feel. I can particularly relate to your statement:  \"The day my father was diagnosed we left the hospital with almost no guidance on how to proceed or navigate the treacherous waters into which we were thrown nor were we made aware of the countless ways in which our lives were about to change. I consider it a great failing of the healthcare system. In that most crucial vulnerable and desperate of moments we were sent home completely in the dark about what to expect prepare for how to care for and protect my father and those around him and where to seek help.\"  Amen. Any disease of the brain including mental illness is so under-treated and not understood even now in 2022; we are all left to flounder around and figure things out for ourselves! Most doctors DO NOT understand dementia/Alzheimer's or any of the various dementia's in general and it's mind-boggling how alone we all ARE on this journey. My hope like yours is that advances will be made in our medical community to study the brain diseases and to learn more in an effort to help all who suffer and their FAMILIES to find coping mechanisms to deal with the behaviors. AgingCare forum is another wonderful resource for me and for countless others with loved ones suffering from dementia. From one another we often learn a lot MORE than we do from doctors and so-called 'experts' in the field.

But speaking to you being happy to live poor for no good reason. Get mom on Medicaid NOW and into a SNF that accepts Medicaid for petesake! There is no reason on God's green earth why YOU should be required to 'live poor' after 15+ years of caring for mom in your home. Why would you be private paying for her facility? Does she have too much money to qualify for Medicaid? If so SHE should be spending down HER own money to private pay rather than you! If she has no money then she qualifies for Medicaid long term care NOW.  Go speak to a certified elder care attorney to get the REAL 411 about what to do before YOU go bankrupt for no good reason.  I think it's safe to say most all of us 'love' our mothers. Love means we make sure they're cared for properly; whether it's in home or in a managed care environment. I loved my mother dearly too which is WHY I used HER money to have her cared for in Assisted Living and then Memory Care AL for 7 years. Had she moved in with me we too would have fought like cats &amp; dogs and to me that's not an ideal life for either one of us. Instead she lived in peace &amp; harmony in managed care where there was no fighting and where she received quality care by devoted caregivers.

Why shouldn\u2019t people have the right to end of life when all we\u2019ll be is a burden?", "body": "That isn't how it works in Switzerland. People are not let go because their care is costly and unpleasant and family doesn't get a vote in when it is time for the person \"to go\". Only the patient can decide when it is time and the patient must first go through psychological testing to be certain that the person understands what he is asking and that this is what the person wants. Dignitas which is the one often used (about 10000.00 for the entire process) demands that you have thorough paperwork and interviewing that this is your wish. The one difference between there and here is that you don't need the \"6 months and you will be dead\" rule nor do you need to have a diagnosis of a life-taking disease. You can merely be OLD and request this. Or you can be facing down a diagnosis of dementia and ask for this. But you cannot HAVE dementia to the extent you are no longer mentally competent.  I agree with you that I wish we had a \"Dignitas\" here. As an old retired RN I very MUCH wish it were here. You should not be paying for your elder's care. What will happen when that money you are spending is not there for your own age? Who will pay? Just listening to how many veterinarians take their own lives on an NPR program the other day; animal care is so difficult and so heartbreaking. But the thing they feel most enables them is the readily available medications to do it. One in six vets they say will eventually relieve themselves of their own lives with their own medications. This indicates there may well be many out there who would be willing now to exit this life.  I think that law will loosen in our own country when in future given our current birth rate we have many more seniors \"living too long\" who have no one to care for them and the \"system\" cannot sustain the cost of ongoing care that doesn't help but merely keeps alive the living husk of a being who is suffering and ready to go.

I'm eating some delicious slimy okra right now Send.  CW PeggySue I think slimy asparagus can come from frozen. I've noticed a wide variety in frozen asparagus I've bought and it ranges from not-bad to almost like it's been canned and left in liquid for years. I know canned asparagus exists too but I can't imagine why someone would buy asparagus that way. Of all the veggies that don't taste right if you can them...

My father walked in one day on our cheery repast of sumptious beef broth and really yelled at my mother about it. Anyways...fast forward a few years on and some of the meals she made were really really good. I guess 'cause we'd moved into a very swanky neighborhood and all the other moms were cooking like crazy-this was at the height of Julia Child French food and James Beard. That lasted for awhile then being a narcissist all kinds of other foods were made. She had a thing for the wholistic vegan (and this was over 40 years ago) cooking....the Nixon bean burgers were almost inedible.....which took a few weeks to digest.  For those of youse who have picky eaters who won't touch vegetables there are lots of easy ways to sneak 'em into meals. Say....tomatoe \"sauce\"....cook down other vegetables of choice puree 'n add to the sauce.   Children have fairly sensitive taste buds so the sulfers in broccoli cabbage are pronounced to them.

I played the game and put my LO that does not need the medical aspect of a SNF into a SNF despite everyone and their mother outside social work telling me it is not best for them I should use home care. They are still highly functional they are too young. All true points but it was unsafe for them to be in their home and it would have been unsafe for them to stay with me.   I was suggested to a bunch of caregiver resources books podcasts YouTube videos and seminars. No one really got it expect the social worker everyone claimed with enough effort I could do it. I knew couldn't had I tried I probably would have hurt her because I would have snapped. The social worker told me not everyone can do this and they wish employment side of things could be more selective but they cannot they need bodies and the turnover rate is extremely high.  I agree overall with what you are saying but I just do not see caregiver judgment as a skill we all have.

It is true that people can reach a point where they just can't change another diaper. Or clean more piss and sh*t off of the floor clothes and furniture of a hoarded elderly house. They cannot get through one more day of a person asking the same question or saying the same thing over and over again because they're in a dementia loop and fixated on it. The caregiver has to know when to walk away before they lose control themselves. I worked my last paying caregiving job for seven years. I actually enjoyed it the first couple of years. The client had dementia and mobility issues but was still functional with assistance. We went out all the time and had fun. I was responsible for all the housekeeping errands and helping her with showering and dressing but that was fine. I made top money too because it was private.  The client reached the point where she should have been in a nursing home. The responsibility of this client fell 100% on me because by this time the husband had passed. The out-of-town family did nothing. I stayed longer than I should have. If I left when the husband passed they would have acted and put her in a nursing home. I didn't because of the money. I never neglected the hands-on physical care. She was kept immaculately clean. Bed-bathed head to toe every single day. Her bed and house was always spotless. She was well-fed and her medication was properly handled. I neglected her emotionally though. I had burnout so bad by this time that I could barely stand the sight of her. I was a robot and worked in total silence. By this time I was naming my price and the family paid it. They had nothing but the highest respect for me as well. The job was ruining my life.  Caregivers have to know when to walk away. It's not so much about who's \"cut out\" to be caregivers and who not. It's a judgement call. I've known caregivers who were the most loving and caring. They wanted to help people and bought the \"rewarding\" job nonsense. Until they actually got into the work and their elderly clients didn't appreciate them like they expected and abuse happened. It's all about caregiver judgment and knowing when to walk away before abuse happens.

Such factors feed into despair and desperation. A person imo can only bear so much than snap. I have seen overly good people that in a million years would never imagine hurting a person let alone someone in their care. Yet have beaten the person in their care a person can only take so many diapers screaming etc... before they snap.   Not everyone is cut out to be a caregiver yet we market such a position as something everyone can do and pay accordingly due to it be labeled as low skill work. Imo it is far from low skill work it requires a specific perspective and personality that cannot be taught.  I do think it is disingenuous to even say that working a dead end job with little upward mobility living a life in stress about how you are one crisis away from being potentially homeless if they have children telling them may have to wait on their next pair of glasses that are broken or get made fun at school because you had to wear the same thing over and over being so overworked and tired thar you cannot even go to a school event for your child.   In short living a life in constant stress or worry is not healthy and unfair wages working conditions can even bring down the moral of person if they go through it long enough.  I am also not making an excuse for the person what I am saying is it does not shock me. Like in the field I work in it did not shock me the issues around Blizzard popped up. I think taking a look at the environment in which one came from or works in is not about making an excuse but it also something we need to consider. Sure many do not give in or cave but that does not mean the situation did not have an impact on what happened be it in caregiving or in my field of game development or Hollywood etc...  I agree it does not create evil and I do not think I have said it does nor do I think I said it should be used as an excuse.

{"post_id": "471716", "title": "How could I SAY that?", "body": ["<p>So, this isn't so much a question as it is something I need to get off my mind or I'll go crazy. My mom (65) has had two strokes this year and, at least in my opinion although it hasn't been diagnosed yet, is suffering from dementia of some kind. I have lived with her since 2005 and, although we had a great relationship, we are both hot-tempered and have had our share of fights. After mom had her second stroke and it was clear that she would need full-time care, I turned down a well-paying new job and have since devoted myself to caring for her alone. This has been since October 18th of this year and I am ashamed to say it, but I have already had like four or five meltdowns. And I'm talking screaming, crying, hysterical meltdowns to the point where I've wanted to kill myself, where I've wanted her to die, where I've said incredibly terrible things and punched walls and actually threw and broke a portable grill on my kitchen floor. I have accidentally put bruises on my mom's wrists because I was trying to stop her from kicking me (again), and felt so guilty about it that I contemplated contacting my aunt to come take care of her because I thought I was unfit. I have said things to my own mother like \"I hope the next stroke kills you!\", \"I wish you were dead!\", \"I regret brining you home from the hospital!\", \"I hate you!\" and so on. I have felt instantly guilty when these horrible words burst out of me, I have apologized, and my one saving grace is that my mom doesn't remember any of this, but I do and it breaks my heart and will be a stain on my soul that no amount of time or forgiveness will ever get rid of. <br>So, in my dark hours lying awake in bed at night, after another long and miserable day of trying to take care of this woman who I love more than anyone else and who I would do anything for, I ask myself one question over and over...How could I SAY that? How could I say these things that no human being should ever say to another? How could I say these things to my mother, who is the most amazing person I've ever known, who raised me and loved me and made my childhood happy and safe? How could I get so angry at this person who is clearly sick and can't help it? How can I even think these things about my mother, who deserves so much better than this, than me?<br>I have tortured myself with these questions, and so many more. I have felt guilt so raw and intense that it cripples me and keeps me from getting out of my chair and makes it so I can't sleep. I thought I would die from the weight of the shame I felt.<br>But then I started to answer my own questions, and I'll tell you how I can say these things that are horrible and that I don't mean. They come from fear, from exhaustion, from sadness and desperation and resentment and feeling trapped. These words come from anger and guilt and stress and not knowing how long this situation is going to last or how bad it will get. These words come from having to give up my job, my life and some of my sanity to take care of a woman who can be childish, mean-spirited, combative and aggressive. These words come from being sick of changing diapers and cleaning sheets and being kicked and grabbed and having to fight her for every inch of everything. These words come from the exhaustion of just trying to get her up and clean and dressed for a doctors appointment, and knowing that it is going to be a struggle the entire way because she is completely unmotivated to do anything. These words and feelings come from knowing that when I try to give her her meds she'll most likely slap them out of my hand again. These words come from her lack of hygiene and having to deal with her horrible breath and dirty hair and having to wash her in the shower. These words come from having to clean down the entire bathroom at least twice every day and trying not to gag on how disgusting it all is. These words come from grief, and the loss of our lives being happy and free.

You need to think about the next step here; how to get mom on Medicare and then apply for Medicaid to get her placed because you can't and shouldn't go on like this; it's not healthy for either one of you. Keeping mom home has to work for BOTH of you and clearly it's not so something has to change. Having meltdowns doesn't mean you're a bad person; just that you're an exhausted and burned out person and rightly so!   I grew up with a mother who agreed to take her mother into our house and they did not get along. My mother was extremely resentful of having my grandmother living with us and it wreaked havoc in the house all the time. Nobody was happy. Mom should have made other arrangements for grandma so that BOTH of them could have had a better life meaning ALL of us would have had better lives; dad and myself included. Instead she felt like she 'had' to keep grandma in our house out of some misguided sense of duty when grandma would have been better off in a nursing home! Ultimately mom cried uncle and sent grandma off to an aunt's home to live and the aunt said No Way and sent her to a nursing home where she did fine. She lived to be 91 and died in her sleep one night peacefully with a smile on her face. It should have been done YEARS earlier.  Please take your life back and allow yourself to HAVE a life now. You deserve to. If I had to live with and care for my mother I'd have shot myself honestly. I could NEVER do it in a million years!

{"post_id": "473547", "title": "Tables Turned: Packing, Cleaning and Moving", "body": "It has definitely been a learning curve. I tried really I tried to get as much culled out before the 'big pack' as I call it but so much stuff really is necessary for a few more years. I'm still baking and so all those supplies need to stay. I still can a few things and all that stuff also. However the thought of canning salsa ever again--meh I think I can do without.   I watched my girls do exactly what I have done to mother umpteen times and felt that I almost owe her an apology--although in her case she hoards papers and magazines and envelopes--true garbage and I have too many 'craft interests' which do benefit people. But I may never do them again.   This move has not been without a lot of drama and a few tears. DH is capable of doing a LOT of home improvement but while he needed to do some smaller jobs he got slammed by work and instead of helping me he was working at his job. So we're way behind on the 'schedule'....  LUCKILY--we sold this house to our nephew and then rented it back from him so technically we don't have to hand over the keys until the 31st. We plan to have everything out by Wednesday.  Our carpet guy mis measured and so we have no carpet in the 2nd most important area--the office. Praying that we can get that done by Tuesday--as DH HAS to work. Probably the entire office will be in the garage and we'll move it in and set it up next week.   None of our appliances can go in until the cabinetry is done and THEY are waiting on the main contractor to tear out a portion of the kitchen island so that also means our granite countertops are still sitting in the warehouse.   I'll do the best I can but b/c of the new sheetrock I can't 'put away' my kitchen as I would have to re-dust every drawer and shelf yet again.   We don't have much furniture really planning to downsize but SIL had some furniture he uses for staging small condos and he gave that to us. So we have like one truckload of furniture and a lot of boxes to move. My middle daughter is coming over after school and she will super organize the boxes so the move can be effective and smooth.   Through all of this I have been very aware of the unrest in the Ukraine and it has certainly put perspective on my little first world problems. We're so incredibly blessed with this new place and I know it's where we belong now and for the rest of our lives. This too shall pass and the memories of the home with our babies will be a joy I hope. I have to say a day didn't go by that I didn't feel like we were 'asses to elbows' in this tiny home. Funny how now we routinely get 'lost' in the new place.   Life is funny--my OD just committed to a 1500 sf addition to her lovely home and my YD just bought a freaking mansion of 7000 sf. So we're all in flux this summer.  I pray my back and hip hold out..I was in so much pain yesterday it was unbearable. Tomorrow will be all directing and bossing people. I don't plan to lift anything over 10 lbs.   Thanks for just listening. This is one of life's most stressful occurrences and I for one am really really feeling it!!

Stories like yours encourage me. Plus having cleaned out at least two houses for elders going to facilities I recall going through the belongings of others and making the decision on what was essential and what was not - and it wasn't even my stuff! Sometimes I picture if I were suddenly gone and someone ELSE were cleaning out my house to sell it.... they would not realize/discern what items ever mattered to me and what items did not. I think it would all end up in a dumpster. Being able to continuously organize and try to keep it pared down seems much better than having the decision made by someone else after I'm no longer able to.

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch but knew very little about ranching so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand. Two cowboys applied for the job. One was a gay Mexican and the other a drunk gringo. \u00a0 She thought long and hard about it and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. \u00a0 The gay guy proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching. For weeks the two of them worked and the ranch was doing very well. \u00a0 Then one day the rancher's widow said to the hired hand \"You have done a really good job and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels.\" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. \u00a0 One o'clock came however and he didn't return. \u00a0 Two o'clock and no hired hand. \u00a0 Finally the ranch hand returned around two-thirty and upon entering the room he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine waiting for him. \u00a0 She quietly called him over to her. \"Unbutton my blouse and take it off\" she said.

She's being kept comfortable by hospice, who's been marvelous since they accepted her in late December.

It's probably one of her beloved late sister's she's been talking about incessantly for months now. :)</p>", "<p>We are scheduled to leave for AZ next Friday for my DH to have a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix.

All of the companies are screened. They have had a lot of success at both ends. It was on the \"Today\" Show.  It's sounds like you and hubby jumped in and did a remarkable job reversing everything. You should both be commended.  You are doing an absolutely fabulous job! Keep in mind years' ago someone once said to me \"You can let people rock your boat but don't let them tip you over in it\". I think you get my message.  You are trying to give I assume (your mother-in-law) dignity and quality of life. You also sound like you have \"order\" in your life. When you are caregiving you have to keep some people at bay. I am organized just like you neat on time people remarked how orderly and \"peaceful\" everything is. Peaceful I repeat. This doesn't happen on it's own. It's by keeping a routine schedule and being a good steward over what you do have (materials things living arrangement etc.)  Don't let other people's \"erratic\" behavior come into your castle. It's takes work it takes declining \"some not all\" invitations and you set the schedule for visitations with your mother-in-law. When they visit \"the troublemakers\" you give them a window for example Mom is at her best in the morning from 10AM-12 Noon. Tell them we have appointment to get to that gets them out the door.  I don't imagine this sibling ever shows up with a box of pastry or flowers and asks you \"do you need anything\"? You have to take control which you certainly have and limit contact with the sibling who will destroy everything you built.  I am the female version of Felix Unger so I have my quirky ways we all do. But I insist on keeping my small place with Mom a place of beauty. And some people seek out to destroy that. Don't be polite about this.    The one's that make the most noise usually do the least and usually get the most attention and resources in the family. Unfortunately oftentimes their situation never improves. We all have a relative or (2) who needs a little help now and then along the way and you pitch in and they get on their feet--a death divorce sickness job loss--life happens. But for other's it can be lifelong with no end or improvement of any kind in sight. I call it the kitten who lost their mittens. They always have a problem. Probably more than what you can provide. More like they need professional help-social worker retraining skills perhaps housing and food voucher. They need to be assessed but you can't do everything.   Stay centered.

There's a need for support on a site like this b/c caregivers to elders in general are burned out exhausted and devastated b/c they've devoted their lives to loved ones who basically do not appreciate their effort; who complain &amp; treat them like dirt in return. So we're here to vent; to ask for help ideas tips support and to hear that we're not alone when we feel like we're falling off the edge of the Earth. You're not hearing positive stories b/c there are very FEW positive stories to share. Aside from yours that is.  You on the other hand are in an atypical situation where you're thrilled to be caring for your mom for the past 14 years thrilled to have given up your former life to do so thrilled to be 'relaxing' and to have quit your job given up your freedoms friends girlfriends concerts and all the rest of it in exchange for your caregiving duties. Which is great for YOU and you should be applauded for your devotion to your mother who apparently loves &amp; appreciates all of your efforts.  But that scenario is suited to probably 3% of the planet if that in reality. So to come here to this forum and expect to hear YOUR stories uplifting and 'non-depressing' stories such as the one you're telling is about as likely as a snowstorm in Florida in August truthfully. You don't like people telling you how YOUR story is off-the-wall yet you're here telling us OUR stories are off the wall or depressing? This is OUR reality James and for us it's an UGLY reality whether you agree with it or not. Because caregiving to elders IS a hard &amp; ugly job as you may find out yourself if your mother becomes incontinent &amp; dementia ridden &amp; starts playing with her feces &amp; spreading it all over the walls the bed &amp; the furniture. Then you may decide to come back to AC &amp; seek some of the support you once found to be 'so depressing' huh?  The vast majority of us are not 'relaxing' or 'enjoying' our time watching TV or fiddling around on a computer. I can tell you I DO have a cell phone which rang continuously with calls from my parent's ALF with them telling me of mom's falls all 95 of them. With calls from their doctors and nurses and hospice and EMTs and ambulance companies and specialists and hospitals and rehabs and mortuaries and moving companies for the SEVEN MOVES I've made for them and and AND. Because for most of us that's part of Real Life which you have managed to bow out of for the most part aside from staying home and relaxing and answering calls from your mother which you 'don't mind doing at all'. Which is your prerogative certainly.  But please reserve YOUR judgment for US like you've been telling US to do for YOU.  I don't like Twitter; I find it depressing and rather offensive.

{"post_id": "473712", "title": "Just wanted to share...", "body": "My entire belief in and approach to determining whether or not a study was worth reliance changed after taking statistics classes. There are so many variables that aren't distinguished in studies and sometimes in my mind make them worthless.  I skimmed the cited article and with absolutely no offense to WearyNow I didn't think it was particularly unique or frightening enough for me to consider napping when I feel like it. On the contrary I think napping is the body's method of resting when it's needed or especially after working hard or outside. I used to feel the need for a nap after mowing the lawn or gardening!  First there apparently were absolutely no other dementia contributors factored in. From articles I've read sugar consumption if more than \"average\" (whatever that is) could be a factor. It's well known that sugar and excess sugar consumption is not helpful to health for various reasons.  Second the sample tested is small. How many people between 74 and 88 exist? What percentage is 1400 of that total number of people in that age group? 1% 5% 10% more???? Who knows?  \"The new study used data gathered over 14 years by the Rush Memory and Aging Project which followed over 1400 people between the ages of 74 and 88 (with an average age of 81).\"  Third apparently no other health factors were considered in the study. What was each person's health status before during and after the study? Did the people exercise on a regular basis? Interact with others? Eat a Mediterranean diet or an American diet?   Live in a large populated area or a remote area? Live in a country which supports family interaction through generations or one more like America in which generations sometimes separate and move through different lifestyles?  Fourth what support did they have - family friends? Were they interacting with others whether still working part time jobs volunteer jobs (that to me would be an important issue).   Fifth the study duration is small very small: 14 out of 365 days annually.   \"The new study used data gathered over 14 years by the Rush Memory and Aging Project which followed over 1400 people between the ages of 74 and 88 (with an average age of 81).  \"For 14 days each year participants in the current study wore a tracker that captured data on their movements; No movement for an extended period between the hours of 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. was interpreted as a nap.\"  What season was this? People get more tired during especially extreme weather. And weather has changed over the last several years. Summers are hotter people have less energy and that can also occur when it's frigid outside and some people cuddle up in warm blankets instead of moving around a lot.   From what area of the country was the sample? If I lived in Florida or Texas I know I wouldn't be moving around as much as I do in Michigan.  Conclusion (skipping a lot of factors):  \"I don't think we have enough evidence to draw conclusions about a causal relationship that it's the napping itself that caused cognitive aging but excessive daytime napping might be a signal of accelerated aging or cognitive aging process\" she said.\"   At least the conclusion is qualified as it should be. This could be the start of several studies and I don't blame the researchers; CNN phrased the study qualifying it yet not as much as the actual study did. However that's the nature of news I think is to qualify infer and inject conclusions.   WearyNow thanks for sharing this. While it's not conclusive and as PolarBear pointed out \"suggested\" rather than provided more definite observations it does raise the issue of dementia and can be a reminder that there's still a lot of research to be done on dementia.", "date": "2022-03-20 12:47:57", "user_name": "GardenArtist", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/just-wanted-to-share-473712.htm"},

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "Hello I am new to caregiving on 24/7 basis.   My mother-in-law is 77.  For 8 years since my father-in-law passed my husband's sibling and adult children have taken advantage of her; stripped her financially destroyed her property stole whatever they could to support their addictions. They left their dogs for her to care for (11?) and the list goes on. Anyway the house was full of rodents roaches a large rat snake (not a pet) holes in the walls and floors falling through.   Mom did not want to leave her husband died here so my husband left his job moved to his mom's removed all the human rats and spent 2 years cleaning the property and getting ready for a new home be put on it for her.   My husband found homes for multiple dogs so now we are down to 4 outside and 2 inside) and the new home was put on the property. Now we are getting ready to remove the remaining debris.  However Mom's personal care got to be too much for hubby alone so I retired from my position - he picked up a local job and now I care for mom 24/7.   When I was working I bought mom all new clothes bedding towels drapes furniture appliances etc...so everything was ready for the new house.   To present....So far it has been pretty easy...I clean and do laundry in the AM. She gets up around noon then the rest of the day belongs to her. Typically every other day begins with giving her a shower doing her hair cleaning her bed and bath rooms cooking breakfast massaging her knees and feet and cleaning up incontinence issues as they occur throughout the day - which occassionally means multiple showers.  Her bedroom is cleaned regularly and her 2 little inside dogs (one is mostly house trained the other one poops and pees wherever she feels like it probably because she is a senior dog) - are cared for; fed and bathed.  Mom has since progressed wonderfully in many ways - health wise. Her skin and face looks fresh the arthritic swelling in her knees (which made wearing pants difficult for her) has significantly gone down and she is now able to move around her new home much easier.   Problem 1: One sibling. Everything is drama and most of the time this sibling needs money. - which mom always tries to give. Last year the child demanded a lot of money for a downpayment on a car...literally bullied her until it was received -- and it is like this most every month. Its always something leaving Mom upset and wanting to give whatever money is \"needed\" to this child.   When we explain there is no money to give the bullying gets worse mom gets stressed and anxious her memory lapses she gets confused angry and frustrated. She talks about selling everything going to a nursing home or just dying. It literally takes a couple of days to calm her down.   This sibling hasn't been over for 2 weeks now..mom is starting to flourish though she still calls this sibling everyday.   Problem 2. I will have start working again soon. I am applying for work-from-home positions. Though finding something legit is proving difficult.  So coping: I think I am doing okay.  I do feel a little isolated at times not too bad..Financially we are stressed.

Well that woman just so happens to be my Husband's biological mom. He moved in with her into the house he grew up in back in 2011. She just couldn't keep up with all the responsibilities of the property and at the time he was single so he was happy to help. Back then he could work a full time job and not worry about his mom being alone all day. Now fast forward 11 years and I am the one providing the care for his mom who cannot be left alone period! I married him he has 4 other siblings who do nothing but criticize and gossip about me when they are together yet they don't help with 87 yearold mom. The x son in law helps more than her own kids except my husband. I'm here with her all day while my husband is at work. And when his siblings practically scared and threatened me into the position claiming I never \"went upstairs to help\" considering that my husband's sister lived upstairs with her and I did go up there but the sister was not mentally stable what so ever and I couldn't be around her she would accuse me of stealing from her and she would get physically violent at times. Plus I did all the house work and made sure all the garbage on the property was up on the road every week and cleaned up the property plus I took care of my 14 yearold son and husband on top of cleaning after his sister and aging mom. So the truth is she financially took advantage of the situation did nothing to benefit anyone in the house made more messes and verbally abused her mom for what? To get a free ticket out of our house and get taken care of by sis telling the sis that my husband and I do nothing for his mom that I never go upstairs when she was the reason why I couldn't sometimes to up there.

It only lasted a minute of two. I did not say a word this time just letting him be himself and I hope the doctor could see the changes. Later that day hubby and I had a real disagreement about his cognitive ability I did not tell him about some stuff I've changed over the past month or so as a direct result of his dementia.

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "My 91 year old father moved in with my husband and I a little over two months ago. He fell at home (he lives 10 minutes away - we've always been a close family) and fractured his pelvis spent a few weeks in rehab. Our house is a two family and my sister lives upstairs (it's not a big two family - 2 beds downstairs and one up a bathroom on each floor). The facility specifically told us that my father could no longer live by himself. My sister works full-time and is single so she cannot care for him during the day. I've been working part-time off and on for years family has always been a priority so caregiving fell on my shoulders. Just seemed to make sense to move Dad into our house so he wouldn't be alone and I could still take care of the pets and everything else. We rented a van and moved our college aged daughter into my old bedroom at his house (she's away at school) and my father took her room at our house. My sister moved some of her things into his house in her old room and kept some of her things in her apartment upstairs (my father was very worried that someone would break into his house and didn't want it sitting empty - we figured one less thing for him to worry about). Basically everyone's life was uprooted. The first couple of weeks my father was literally awake all the time. The rehab facility changed his medication and added some new drugs that really did not agree with him. His doctor prescribed additional medication to help him sleep - it woke him up and made him more confused. It took a while to get his medications straightened out but we did. Showering was an issue - thankfully my husband volunteered for the job. Incontinence is an issue. He still gets the urge to use the bathroom but can't make it. So he wears adult diapers. Only problem is that he still thinks he has to run to the bathroom. So he was doing this at night and not putting the diaper back on properly or just not putting it back on at all. So there were many many night time accidents. And like a child he woke us up nightly screaming he was wet (him the bed everything needed to be changed all hours of the night). So I was constantly washing something - my dryer called it quits after two weeks (I completely understood - it was a lot of work).   He has physical and occupational therapy a few times a week at home along with a visiting nurse. The therapy helps a lot but feels like my home has a revolving door - always someone stopping by for something. My dogs are always barking at someone. The therapy has helped him immensely. My father is walking much better with a cane and has learned how to properly use the bathroom and potty chair in his room. The occupational therapist worked with him and he no longer wets the bed at night the way he was when he first moved in. Biggest problem right now is his constant craving for attention and severe memory loss. If he wakes up at 3 in the morning he thinks we're all ignoring him (we're sleeping). I keep reminding myself that it's all new for all of us him included. It's not easy and I don't know what the future holds.Some days are good and some days are tough.

They may be renters or have little equity in their home. They can't afford to pay in home caregivers Medicare doesn't provide much help. Community Medicaid provided caregivers may be a possibility but in reality it is very difficult to get. The Dr's and nurses really don't provide any guidance or help. The Dr may tell you (the patient's family member) to call nursing homes but when you call them the answer is always \"no openings\" or get on a waitlist. It doesn't help if there isn't the money to private pay first and then go on Medicaid. Those with assets have an easier time of getting admission as they may be able to private pay first. So how do these people who need NH home care or will very soon but don't have a lot of money get the care they need? The answer a lot of the time is to send them to the hospital as a \"social admit\". This is sometimes easier said than done though and many in the industry don't think it should be done. But in reality in many cases there is no other alternative other than maybe calling a state social worker (or APS). I stumbled across a nursing forum for RN's once and there was this whole long thread of hospital nurses berating family members who brought their demented loved one to the hospital. They didn't think it was right that otherwise healthy people that didn't need acute care were dropped off to them because family couldn't deal with them.

{"post_id": "187022", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "Not sure if this thread is still monitored but in answer to the question one day at a time. My parents moved in with me back in 2019; my dad had Parkinson's &amp; mom was worn out from caregiving for him. He was a piece of work; used to being independent and being the boss but with the PD the filter that used to keep him at least nominally interested in other people disappeared. He passed away after a hospitalization in 2020 - probably a PE but a blessing/release in any case.   So now it's just mom living with me. I bought a house for them to move in with me because my condo would not have worked (stairs). Overextended myself on it but it's done. All of their stuff is in the main part of the house; I have my own room/bathroom but just about everything else is hers. My stuff is in the basement as is the rest of hers because when we moved God forbid we got rid of too much. Dishes pots/pans etc. that never get used but have to be unpacked &amp; put on shelves... (\uff0d\u2038\u10da).   I ended up spreading my own furniture out to occupy the space I needed to avoid having her ideas take over the basement too. My dad didn't leave her with much financially and what she had left after their house sold is almost gone because she just buys things we don't need. Retail therapy.   She's had a cough for 4 months now - her dr is treating the symptoms which is about all he can do since the likely reason for it is she eats too much of the wrong things (wheat dairy etc.). I think she has an eating disorder - she used to be quite heavy but had gastric bypass followed by several other complications. She has plenty of energy to shop or cook all over the kitchen but gets exhausted if she has to do anything she doesn't want to do.   I get that some of this is probably backlash from being my dad's caregiver herself for so many years; he wasn't a kind man before PD &amp; she's a retired nurse so there was a lot she did that probably most wouldn't have done. But sure as she feels the least bit neglected she gets \"sick\" which then becomes an actual sickness requiring attention &amp; reassurance.   I have no friends that aren't also now her friends because she's competitive about it - had to go meet my co-workers so now I don't even have that. We go to church when she's up to it - which she hasn't been for weeks because she's self-conscious about the coughing. Yes she has asthma but again cutting out the wheat and dairy help that too - can't cut that out though because that's what she eats: sandwiches with meat and cheese...   I've been working from home for the last almost 2 weeks because we caught whatever bug is floating around; she got dehydrated and dizzy/unsteady. She's better today (drinking more water) &amp; I'm looking forward to going back to the office but then what? She sits at home &amp; waits for me to come home instead of making new friends or contacting the ones she has. I'm not her husband - I'm her daughter....   She won't take care of herself because she knows that I will - sister moved out of the country to not have to deal with this. 2 brothers live in different states - bless them they both have had her stay with them for a week here &amp; there but now mom is not comfortable flying by herself &amp; wants me to go with her. Doesn't get that part of these trips is giving me a break &amp; God forbid anyone should actually say that - she'd go into a funk &amp; throw it up in my face for the rest of her life. NH is not an option at all. Couldn't do it.   She has no hobbies &amp; doesn't want any friends that aren't associated with the church. More &amp; more dependent &amp; enmeshed as the days go by &amp; I'm the bad rotten terrible person who can't say anything because other people do not get it. I love my mom - I really do! - and I was so glad that they moved here instead of being 750 miles away but she's overly dependent &amp; needy &amp; it's getting harder to handle. So one day at a time.

I must confess how naive we were. We love them dearly but the last year consisted of 5 hospitalizations, 2 stints in rehab and too numerous to count doctors visits (with tests as all the Dr's were new and wanted to do their own testing) and that was just my father....we also have my mom with us who has parkinsons along with other illnesses. Dad was WC bound for the most part but he always believed he was fine and could walk again soon. 10 months of mult days a week PT did not change anything and he still declined.My husband and I quickly saw signs of dementia in both of them. Dad was tested and early stage Alz confirmed. Mom will be tested soon.Both gave up drivers licenses when they came.</p>", "<p>In Aug dad was diagnosed with biliary duct cancer and b/c of comorbities was not a candidate for any treatment.

Part of that money also includes money left from the parent who I did love who passed a long long time ago and from two sets of grandparents. And they can't even leave me a cent. And yet there still is an expectation for me to be there at the beck and call and drop everything after all of this and they cannot even do that.</p>", "<p>Children of abusive parents - do not let yourself be pressured by others who know nothing of your circumstances into over -extending yourself to look after them when they are old.

I was also the only D and my parents ended up settling in my city 10 mins away. After my father died my mother slowly started failing but it didn't get bad until she stopped driving at age 90 in 2016. I became her chauffeur and she didn't like it when I placed boundaries about that.   One good thing that I did was to send my 3 brothers an email when I'd been with my mother telling them what I did how she was and how long it took. This was smart on my part since they would otherwise have had no idea how time-consuming she'd become for me.   My 3 brothers are out of state and it took quite a while before they started seeing what I was seeing as she could showtime. Eventually a gall bladder infection landed her in the hospital for 17 days then rehab then LTC in the NH where she finished rehab. Previously to this hospitalization she lived \"independently\" in a condo with the only help being a cleaner once a month (she was fastidiously neat and tidy). She refused to hire help with bathing which she needed. I didn't offer to help and don't know if she would have even allowed it. She sure accepted my help when I stayed with her for 8 long days and nights with some kind of muscle ache a few years prior. She became nearly helpless at that time.   She threatened to cut me out of the trust. She did cut me and one of my brothers out of being POA so that left 2 brothers with joint POA (each could act independently). (One of these brothers took her to the attorney on one of his rare visits -- he later claimed he had no idea what she did at that visit.) At this point she was in the hospital about to transition to rehab. My mental health was being affected and I told the main POA brother that I needed compensation if I was to continue on in my role. He readily agreed and agreed to compensate me with back pay also. (I'd brought up the issue of compensation with my mother previously and she'd gotten indignant and disgusted telling me \"You don't pay family!\")   Just as well that I wasn't POA -- now the POA could pay me $20/hour. (The POA couldn't pay themselves.) No taxes taken out I simply sent my brother an accounting of my hours and he paid from that. My mother would never qualify for Medicaid. Things got better from that point on because I considered it just a job. I had threatened that since I wasn't POA that one of my 2 POA brothers could move her to be near them.   My mother had made it clear (no filters) that I'd always been a disappointment to her was a nasty person was trying to cheat her out of her money etc. She even wrote a disjointed note at the NH to tell one of my brothers (got the name wrong) at the wrong address (was kind of HER brother's address). The staff thought it was quite amusing.

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "I wish I had been able to access your letter 20 years ago! In a nutshell both of my parents were toxic. My mother was cold and emotionally distant and my father was a malignant narcissist. When they were still young and healthy they moved near me and my family. My kids were able to develop a relationship with them because they were good to my children. Good grandparents. Poor parents.  It started slowly. They needed help for this or that we didn't think anything of helping them out. I did not sign on to become their main caregiver. I have three other siblings who lived too far away to help. Mom started having real issues along with severe dementia and my father refused to place her. He would take care of her and when I came over once a week I'd spell him. I didn't want to have to bathe her change her poopy pants take her pills or try to appease whatever delusions she had. And he wasn't capable of taking care of her. Eventually he realized she had to be placed it was more than he could handle.   She died and he fell apart. I had to have him hospitalized three times that year and every time he was angry with me. How dare I take him to the emergency room because I thought he was septic? This brilliant man also developed dementia. He started accusing me of stealing his money. I wasn't stealing his money I was paying his bills because he had refused to sign a POA. Was I supposed to let his lights go out? Not have TV? I accessed his bank account with his permission and paid everything online. With his paranoia he told my brother I was doing \"nefarious things\" at the bank and taking his money. So my brother called the bank believing him rather than discussing the situation with me. DCF was called and when I realized what had happened I called my siblings and told them I quit and one of them was going to have to step in.  They were horrified. Take care of him? But he's so mean and difficult! So for the first time the family got together and made a plan to help me take care of him. But they weren't there for the day-to-day abuse. It just kept getting worse. It was my fault he was old. My fault he was fragile. My fault he was blind. He'd go into rages at me often because I wasn't helping him enough with his laptop. Can you imagine trying to teach someone how to work a laptop when they're blind? He couldn't even remember how to turn it on!!  I had promised him I would do everything in my power to allow him to age in place. In the end I realized that wasn't going to work even though we had contracted with two different agencies to make sure we had 24-hour coverage. One of the aides who was caught sleeping made a complaint to DCF. Kind of a CYA kind of incident.   He was difficult until the very end. Convinced I was stealing his money he kept asking for an attorney to cut me out of the will. After the DCF investigation he went to hospice to wait for a bed at the ALF I had selected for him last year.   In hindsight I should have listened to my therapist who advised me to let go of my relationship with my parents and my brother. But I had been trained to be a \"good daughter\".   Yes I'm getting my inheritance. However I'm going to have to use quite a bit of it to get counseling to overcome my PTSD and my bad feelings about myself because I don't mourn either of them.", "date": "2022-02-01 18:53:17", "user_name": "LilyBear", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/adult-children-abused-by-parents-who-are-now-elderly-467437.htm"},

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "Hi Anonymous1  I was beaten so badly that I have permanent physical scars. My NM claims that it is all in my head and that she has done nothing to be forgiven for. She now 'uses' her age to be extra cruel verbally and emotionally abusive and as an excuse for her behaviour.  I did have care &amp; love shown to me by my great-aunt. When my mother wasn't looking she would feed care for me and love hold me.  My NM does have dementia but can be 'normal' for all doctor community ageing worker visits and so on.  I was always on egg shells trying to please. As an adult I lived with 'the guilt' of being such a \"terrible child\" so that it was my fault that I was beaten abused and humiliated She does her 'act' all the time. She is so good at manipulation and threats that lawyer and doctor are afraid to sign any documentation. I can't get her any other more help without it.  I am expected to be her help. My 'golden-child' sister lives so far away and won't really help me.   I have found out that I am now getting very sick. I think is was the stress I have endured that has actually damaged my heart and body. . Whenever I try to explain to mom that I am too weak or too tired to talk for longer than 30 minutes. then her phone calls and retaliation; get more and more meaner.  She continues to expect me to be at her beckon call even though I have tried to explain that I am sick. Apparently cancer is my fault. It is was and will always be about her.   As children of abusive mothers it is hard to believe that there is real dementia and not just another excuse to abuse us.  I thought I had forgiven my mother many years ago.  Though I can never forget what she did to me and continues to do to me.   I am also a mother who has made many mistakes with my own children now 34 32 30.  Sadly you are so right... you do reap what you sew. I never hit/hurt burnt slashed them called them names belittled them criticized or took away hope or set them up for a fall. I did try to give them better life than I had... but.... it was not enough.   I know that \"you can't give what you don't have\".  I probably did not try hard enough to overcome my upbringing because my boys all have problems; with me and with the world.  After your parent dies you won't get the chance to offer forgiveness. By giving forgiveness you can get forgiveness from others.   I think that abusive narcissists will abandon anyone and everyone (including children siblings 'friends' and parents) if that person is no use to them.  In fact they might walk over and kick a small hungry child--- unless someone is watching.. then they make a HUGE deal out of giving them a dollar.  It is my belief that trying to forgive will at least show you that you have an inner strength that was not pulled out of you and trampled on. Forgiveness is not for the forgiven but for the forgiver.

Sadly I can relate to that. So I will say good for you for standing your ground and not caving in to your extended families judgement. You continue to do what you're comfortable with and the hell with what everyone else thinks.   I was abused by both parents and was fortunate that I lived thousands of miles away from them as they both aged so didn't have to be a part of their care. But even if I had lived right next store I would have opted out as well.  Now all that being said I did long ago forgive my parents as I had to to be able to move on with my life in somewhat of a healthy way so I hope in time you will be able to do that as well. Remember forgiveness is not done to benefit the abuser(s) but it is done to benefit you. And even though I forgave them I still chose to remain out of their lives as it was just healthier for me to do so.  Both of my parents are dead now and I have no regrets in the way things went down.

Soon It was up to 3 drops in the morning and 2 at night. Along the way all the bad behavior started to slowly improve. She stopped arguing about every little thing.

A couple of days ago my dad caused some emergencies at home. While I was trying to deal with them he kept calling on my mom to help him get clothes and other things he wanted (despite me repeatedly telling him not to). Since she has problems remembering things she couldn't follow through half the time then he'd get upset when he had no right to.   All that stress and everything else going on basically overloaded her - it got her so wound up that the benefits of SJW couldn't keep up. Now I'm trying to bring her back down to earth.  The next day (Actually early AM) she was acting obsessive about a financial matter that had been handled years ago. 3 people couldn't convince her it was handled it took her calling my brother (while at work) who handles that end that she was in fact wrong. And today she was back to obsessing about eating the horrible junk food that makes her worse. It's not happening with every little thing like it was before but she's latching on to some things like she did months ago.   Now I just have to work to get her to stay calm and relaxed and remind my dad repeatedly that I'm the one he should be calling when something needs to be done not my mom.  As far as treating low Serotonin. SJW isn't the only option but it's one of the few I can use with her. Meditation can help but she's not one for that. I tried 10hz meditative music (alpha brainwave frequencies) which helps me relax - but she hates that. Improving diet helps but I struggle just to get her to eat enough to maintain weight. Light therapy can help too but getting her to do it and juggle her and my dad is getting more and more difficult.  Beyond that is heavy duty psych medications but I'd rather avoid the side effects and she hates pills as it is so those are out. So SJW has become the easiest most reliable thing. I just wish it didn't give me a headache when I take it - because I could use it too with all the stress.

Lucky you did not break anything. Sorry about not getting support form your mother. She might be aware of your problem at first but forgot. Try not to take it personally. I know it is hard but you do not need any added stress. That is what I do most of the time and if it still bothers you I would have a serious discussion and explain your feeling. You would feel better once you get it off your chest. I had some major health problems in the past and I told my mother and she felt bad in the moment and then forgot about my problem. I wanted her support more than anyone else in the world at a time in my life when I could have died but with her memory loss the support was only there for a brief period of time. My mother was always concerned about her family. She would always put others first. As a declining elder and lots of health problems she has been more focused on herself. I do not take it personally because she was never like that before and I know it is difficult for her. I love her unconditionally. It is difficult to see some changes in her but mostly she is her sweet self.  I hope you start to feel better soon. It might have been lots of stress that caused to to fall and hit your head. It happened to me while my mom was in the ER. I had new shoes on and was rushing to let my niece in the door to the ER and my foot got stuck to the tile floor and I took a flip and hit my head against the wall I was on blood thineeres at the time.. I was in the same room as my mother overnight. It was definately stress and lack of sleep. Take care of yourelf get support from other family members if possible and get help when needed.

I phoned my mother to explain what had happened and that I would be unable to drive over for the next week or so.

I have Been BLISSFULLY no contact since March of 2020 \ud83d\ude03 lots of drama regarding her living in our rental with roommates and hoarding. To many comments and shitty behaviors towards me an my only child Dear Husband.  My husband hasn\u2019t seen his mother since he moved her out of the rental in July of 2020. Yes her crap and roommates crap stayed in our rental for months! I had to send a formal letter stating we would pay 1 month of storage. Mind you she had help from my husband our daughter (17) and flying monkeys to move.  DH has finally come out of the FOG. He still has some work to do in regards to her guilting him over the phone. He hasn\u2019t seen her since July 2020.  Her bday is this weekend and he has offered to have our daughter drive her and her FM (flying monkey) to our cabin property that has been passed to him. Falling apart when we got it.  Im worried she is going to pull some form of guilt and he will get into a funk/bad mood. I\u2019m hoping that DD driving her 1-1/2 hours to and from the property will alleviate her guilting him on the car ride if he had to take her lol. She only shows her crappy side to DH her brother and me. DD is my child from a previous marriage\u2026 so she\u2019s not family (MIL words)  Im torn between wanting her to behave and wanting her to mess up. DH said if she acts up\u2026he has done his diligence in trying to spend time with her.  I refuse to get her a gift. He bought her a card. In the past we would splurge and take her out and she would invite her FM and order to the nines. Also would invite herself and 2 uncles b-day (they don\u2019t get along) they ordered over $350 worth of cocktails and surf/turf grrrr many more stories of her thinking we are her piggy bank (she can well afford things btw) sorry got side tracked \ud83d\ude02.  hugs to you guys in healing from these Monsters!  oh yeah (ex-foster child here) she has stated more than once to me that we should do things for her because \u201cI know you don\u2019t know this but that\u2019s what family should do\u201d her words.

{"post_id": "472839", "title": "Sadness with being the \"survivor\".", "body": "Upstream Did your mom pass? I\u2019m really sorry if she did.  The last I remember she was in an ALF but planning to move back home against your better judgment.   I have been using Brene\u2019 Browns latest book as a reference book recently. She discusses human emotions and shares her sources. Under grief she mentions different types of grief that we go through. Some not conventionally recognized as grief. That would be Disenfranchised Grief.  Situations that need grieving where there are no traditional mourning practices.  Also there are three types listed from The Center for Complicated Grief. Acute grief Integrated grief and Complicated grief.   Although the explanation of Complicated Grief from The Center for Complicated Grief is different from this I think all caregivers have a complicated grief.   Being \u201cthe last\u201d and feeling the full weight of that is certainly an occasion for grief. In your case from reading your posts over the years I wonder if you aren\u2019t also suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? You have been through a lot with your parents. We all have been through a lot in our lives and it is so good that you are honoring yourself with searching for support.  Perhaps your next therapist should be one with training in complicated grief work? Whether your mom has passed or not you have been grieving for a long time. Very understandable.   So after writing that about Brene\u2019 Brown I wondered what she would say about trauma. I did a google and came across a great podcast transcript of hers with Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Bruce Perry about their book \u201cWhat Happened To You? Conversations on Trauma Resilience and Healing\u201d. It might be helpful.   One last thing and perhaps not so heavy as my other suggestions is Ancestry.com When I started on ancestry years ago it was only for a few minutes at a time. My mom loved genealogy and I would look up things for her. After awhile I realized that I felt more connected to my family and that I wanted to know more. Reading the census records gave me a feeling of being with those great greats back in the day Sometimes I was shocked to see how long ago they lived as their stories were so relatable. Previous to this my eyes would roll back in my head when the genealogy subject came up. It was like reading the fine print of an insurance policy to me until I felt the connection.

{"post_id": "472854", "title": "Need to vent\u2026", "body": "Hi Amy &amp; welcome to the forum!  I'm sorry you are going through this with your mother. Why did you move her in with you if I may ask? My mother has always been a very negative individual as well which made me decide to NEVER move her in with me decades ago. So when I had to move both parents near me in 2011 after dad had to stop driving I set them up in a senior apartment bldg in Independent Living. I still did a ton FOR them it was just not inside my home; they had their place and my DH &amp; I had ours. Then after dad fell &amp; broke his hip I had to get them both into Assisted Living in 2014; dad passed in 2015 and mom stayed on in the same AL. It was a good thing too b/c she was diagnosed with progressive dementia in 2016. She became even more negative &amp; miserable in general so I was VERY relieved that she was in AL and not living with me. We were able to maintain our relationship intact that way vs. me having a ton of resentment and hating my life in my own home as you are feeling now.  Mom is now 95 and living in Memory Care AL wheelchair bound and incontinent. She has WAY too many issues to live anywhere BUT in managed care so she's where she belongs and very well cared for by the staff and visited by myself &amp; my DH frequently. Her dementia has progressed to the point where she's delusional almost all of the time so she thinks she's living in a hotel and going out to different restaurants and entertainment centers on a daily basis so that keeps her happy thankfully.  You have to figure out how to get your mom into her OWN place now preferably in Assisted Living that also has a continuum of care so she can segue into Memory Care when the time comes. You tell her that you love her very much but that you need your house back it's not working out for EITHER one of you to be living together. Period. She'll rant &amp; rave but in the end you're doing this to save your own sanity. She is manipulative and trying to guilt you into feeling pity for her by eating too little etc and that will only lead to you feeling MORE resentment and having the relationship suffer irreparable damage as well. Save it while you still can that's my suggestion. Let the staff in AL take care of her and deal with her tantrums as well; you can go visit her and spend some quality time together instead of this 24/7 situation going on now. If she accuses you of 'throwing her to the curb like trash' so be it. She'll get over it once she acclimates to AL. If you wind up hating her by keeping her in your home who wins then? Neither one of you. You're better off having her angry NOW than having a horrible relationship for the rest of your lives.  Here is a useful article on dementia called Understanding The Dementia Experience by Jennifer Ghent-Fuller; it's a 33 page booklet which is a free download:  https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/210580  It will help you understand what is going on in HER head nowadays and how you can deal with her in a more useful manner.   Wishing you the best of luck dealing with a difficult situation. I hope you agree to take care of YOURSELF now as well as your mother b/c there are TWO lives here that matter!", "date": "2022-02-04 22:06:25", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/need-to-vent-472854.htm"},

I believe she had a TIA about 12 days ago b/c her upper lip was droopy and she was slumping over more than usual in her wheelchair. The hospice nurse advised that TIA are oftentimes precursors to bigger events down the road. On Sunday of this week, she could no longer sit up in her wheelchair &amp; had to be moved into her easy chair in her apartment. On Tuesday she went to bed and has been there ever since. I feel like she may have had a real stroke, but we'll never know for sure.</p>", "<p>She's now developed a fever and is short of breath; the nurse feels heart failure is at play. She's being kept comfortable by hospice, who's been marvelous since they accepted her in late December. I've been visiting her every day &amp; listening to her whisper to someone she's having a conversation with that I can't see. It's probably one of her beloved late sister's she's been talking about incessantly for months now. :)</p>", "<p>We are scheduled to leave for AZ next Friday for my DH to have a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. We can postpone the trip if necessary, by about a week or so.

Many many of us expect family and siblings to rally around to contribute an equal amount to the care of our elders only to be shocked and gravely disappointed and then angry. That being said no one can be assumed into a caregiving role and your siblings are under no moral or ethical obligation to care for their parents (and morality means their own not yours).   So you need to decide if you can come to having peace in your heart to being the only caregiver.   Next are you able to be the only caregiver? Do you have PoA for one or both of them? If so then you also have the ability to be the only one to make decisions in their (and your) best interests. You do not need to have any input or consensus about their care with your siblings. The caregiving arrangement only works if it works for both the care receiver and giver. If it is onerous to you you must find other solutions before you burnout.   You can choose to keep going along the same path down a road of bitterness or to make changes. If you are not the PoA then this is an issue. If no one is their PoA you must work to convince them to assign this responsibility to someone and the logical person right now is you (if you want to keep managing and providing their care). Please do this before they enter cognitive decline or they may not be legally able to assign a PoA at that point.

Are there any reasons you came to the Forum? Did you have questions you wanted answered and did you post them? This is an elder care Forum. It involves people who for the most part are coming for HELP because they want answers. For instance someone yesterday was new to assuming Trustee and POA duties and had a question. For instance today someone is trying to deal with an in-law with an abandoned truck without a title. For instance someone is considering whether Hospice is appropriate. Whether they can report an incompetent Mom insisting on driving to the DMV. Whether Granny's giving money to grandson's college is \"gifting\". Whether a reverse mortgage is good or bad. For instance someone's Mom has a hacked email account. Someone's DIL feels unappreciated. Someone's Dad is clogging the plumbing. Someone keeps getting bladder infections. So yes absolutely PROBLEMS.  For the most part when things are GOOD you don't hear from that person.  As an RN I used to say: \"realize we are terrified about blood thinners because we see the ones with the side effects; most of the patients are home and doing well with years added to their lives\". If you don't need Forum then please don't stay here; we aren't meant to be a sad-movie-of-the-day for anyone.  I came here about four years ago quite desperate and afraid having been called by a Hospital at the other end of the state about my 82 year old bro in for a serious accident \"and oh by the way incidental finding of probably early Lewy's Dementia.Unless we are looking at stroke. And by the way there's a brain tumor looks old and calcified but still\". I was so afraid.  I was at the beginning of a years long journey to help my bro. To become his Trustee his POA to get his last home sold and help him move to ALF to help him adjust. My beloved brother is gone now and it WAS a journey and we had to get through it together as we had everything else in our lives my Gretel to his Hansel in the dark woods. I can't tell you what these people meant to me in terms of support. At the time I grabbed this Forum like a life preserver and I admit that now several years almost after my brother's death I admit--I am addicted! So James I can only say I am so happy you don't need us now and I hope you never do. And if you take on elder care or become elderly I hope you never have bad days in which you have questions or need support. I truly truly do hope that.

I do art there nature and animals and gardening and who watches Sister Wives. It's all great fun. My good man I know you are right.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "Ok. I have been taking care of my mom for the past 13 years. At age 70 she was in a devastating car accident that handicapped her for life. Her legs are like glass as she says. She is the strongest woman to go through what she went through. And now at age 83 she can get around a little and cook and plan and generally is pretty good. As for me taking care of her with the house shopping driving her to doctors and all kinds of stuff has improved my life exponentially. I see my main functions as keeping her from depression. Having her be happy. Protecting her from danger in the house. And watching over things. Keep life going for her and me. She would never be able to live here alone in this house. There are so many little things I do everyday that most people take for granted. But put all the little things aside. My mom would fall into deep depression being alone with no one to talk to and interact with. She has been in a rehab nursing facility for many months after the accident and she hated it. It almost killed her after the accident that almost did. She was transfered to a 2nd nursing home to be closer to home and there she begged the therapist there to let her come home saying being there was destroying her. She had yet to even stand up let alone walk yet. She had a fixator on one leg still. But they let me take her home after meeting with them. From there life got better and better for both of us. Took me a while to get my own terrible past out of my system but slowly day by day year by year it went away. Now life is so much better. God works in mysterious way.

Also to a certain extent I felt it was on me to be her caregiver because 1) she lived with us and 2) I was the only one of my siblings (at the time) who was retired and would not have to \"choose\" between work and care.  I am also the one in the family that tends to feel guilt over things which I have no control - I think that was the influence of my mother's mom with whom I was very close as a child but hooboy did she ever enjoy laying on the guilt. She was really a professional at it.  To my mom's credit she never ever took advantage of me even knowing I felt all of those things that I listed. She was also not physically difficult to take care of; she didn't have any sort of dementia so mentally she was always my mom. It was the CHF that left her so weak that she needed help with some ADL's; others she was able to handle with no problem.   I don't know honestly how I would have done if the time had come that I had to place her. While taking care of her at home was incredibly hard in an emotional and mental sense I am grateful that her health never got so bad that we had to make a hard choice about placement.

As you will know from your last thread opinions here vary. Always pick up what works best for you and leave the rest. And speaking of varying some here love the companies that are modeling on \"A Place for Mom\" and some hate them. The truth is I like them and they have worked well for those I know. BUT they will hassle you once you sign up and you DO have to give them personal information such as the assets of the senior (which some prefer not to divulge.) Once they gather information on the senior they take you to facilities they think a match. For an instance my brother's ex wanders. He has alcoholic encephalopathy and he will leave to buy spirits and is not safe out on the streets. He has a place now which is assisted living with separate cottage and which is still a locked cottage to prevent wandering. PERFECT and he loves it and says he's their favorite! So it worked for him. Now should you use one and then decide it is not for you (they are paid by the facilities in the area when the senior is placed) then just resign and when they call say \"I lied; she's on medicaid\". You will never hear from them again. OP do know that there was nothing against you in your first thread getting locked. More about us. When it rarely happens that our advise moves on into criticizing one another the admins if notified by a trusted member or more will just shut down the cause of distress to further comment. I think this post of yours provides complete information. When that happens there is less back and forth trying to find out what the exact circumstances are. We sure do wish the best to you; am glad you are exploring what might work for the entire family. Do know you will all have grieving and heartbreak and some few tears around this. That's normal.

{"post_id": "472965", "title": "Update: Towards my mothers situation.", "body": "I don't think I responded to your original post because I had seen certain people that I respect their opinions reply so I didn't.   Wandering is a Dementia thing. The one reason I placed my Mom in an AL was because at my house being a split level she was pretty much stuck in the room in the lower level. (She could not do stairs and I had 3 sets) The AL was like a square. The hallway went around inside the building with rooms on both sides. There were comfy chairs and couches book cases with books u could borrow. My Mom walked those halls a lot. Always coming back to the common area and dining/activity room. The AL had an outside area with a Gazebo and benches all around that was enclosed.  I think the care of a Dementia patient is beyond the care of a PCP. A PCP suggesting one on one care is not considering the cost to Mom. Because you should not be paying for that cost. My Mom was also in LTC. By that time she was wheelchair bound but could scoot around in that wc. The residents were allowed to wander the building. They are not confined. They would find one resident sleeping on another residents bed in another wing and walk her back to her wing. If Mom wanders at night there are sleep medications. There is also a night shift to keep an eye on her.   In my State ALs and MCs are private pay. Medicaid only gets involved when the resident has privately paid for at least 2 years. I was lucky 5 yrs ago to get Mom into an AL when they had a half price sale. It kept her cost just below 5k. Money ran out before 2 yrs so she was transferred to LTC with Medicaid paying. (Mom did pay 2 months privately) I see u have an appt with your State Medicaid. Be aware that their \"in home\" care may not pay for 24/7 care. Some States will only give a few hours. Can u be paid to be her caregiver or do they supply aides or do u go thru an agency that excepts Medicaid.  My daughter is an RN who worked in NHs with Dementia patients for 20 yrs. She was with me when we transferred Mom to LTC. After Mom was settled in my daughter said she thought I should have placed her earlier. No it wasn't perfect because Mom will never be cared for the way you would have cared for her. But my Mom was clean and cared for. On the whole the residents looked happy. I would visit and a staff member would be sitting talking to Mom. Others would tell me they had nice conversations with her. Mom was in her final stages.   So glad that you have made a geriatric psychiatric appt. Tests will now be done to determine where Mom is in her journey. What type of facility would most suit her. Kniwingcwhat type ofcDementia she has is important because of Medications.  Seems you are on the right track. Its just a matter of getting all the info you need to make informed decisions.

She likes to be out and about which is not an issue where we are because everyone knows her and she also knows the area very well. She is still operating on her long term memory at this point. The wandering more so will be an issue in places she is unfamiliar with.   They are willing to do an assessment but they told me not to hold my breath based off the conversation we had. I already knew AL was a long shot especially with me being honest with them going based off her worse day not the best. If I went based off her best then it would not be such an issue I think but that is unfair to the staff of the facilities rather be transparent with those involved in her care.   Like I exampled to them she is one of those residents that is easy to please just time consuming. I understand they are for 24/7 care but not a one-to-one companion service. That is more so where my mother is at she gets lonely and bored very easily unless she has some vested interest in the task and all parties are involved. Redirection is requires a more active approach since she still has some retention.   She is EO in terms of raw functional behavior but memory is more so at the Mid to serve stage. As her doctor has put it to me many times she is able to function based around her long deep seeded routine. We have explored medication in the past her current doctor has been against it. They are more in favor of non medication interventions. She has also been my mothers doctor since I was a kid. My mom still remembers them and trusts them.   Either way I have to get a proper assessment on medication management she will not last long without a care plan for when she gets anxious.

Before I became my aunts primary care giver I did some...but limited it because I had a dog I felt bad about leaving AND couldn't find a petsitter. My husband travelled a lot for work and I missed many international trips.  But finding people to dog sit (at the time - he's passed away now) was a challenge where I live so I finally had to decide to kennel him at Petsmart for one trip and regretted it when I came back seeing he had not had proper potty breaks during the 10 days we were gone. Hence my reluctance to travel and leave him. On a different note the same has been true for finding respite workers and caregivers when it comes to my Aunt. I live in a semi rural area in the PNW and I've made multiple attempts to find somebody to come just a for weekend and there is nobody available. This includes going outside of my area and being willing to pay extra. They either don't call back or say they don't come out to where I live or that there is a shortage of caregivers and companions.  Further my Aunt doesn't like it when we leave the house even for a couple of hours which only happens about once every 2 months if that.  I could say more but you get the gist...we virtually have no private time and no time or way to get away. There are no family members to help or friends we can depend on either.", "date": "2021-12-13 22:17:19", "user_name": "GIAGIA", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/how-are-you-coping-187022.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

Certainly there are many examples of this also there are many cases where the opposite happens. I'd explain it that some people have a greater sense of family responsibility than others and this may be due to any number of factors including (but not exclusively) how they were raised.  Also there is the factor of circumstances and the parents' wishes. My husband and I are currently caring for his mother in our home - she has terminal cancer and is in hospice. As you all know it is very difficult. At the appropriate time I plan to discuss with my three children that I will absolutely be going to assisted living if the time comes that I'm not able to care for myself.

If we did it out of reciprocal love and care this wouldn't be an issue.  I think many of us do it because we love our parents regardless of what kind of parent they were or are. Which can be the same or two entirely different people.  I agree with JoAnn that an abused child should not be a hands on caregiver. Making sure they are getting the care they need is the only way to not stay triggered all the time especially if they haven't changed. I think it is also a dangerous situation for elder abuse to occur particularly when the parent treats the adult as a child that is under their authority and needs to be submissive.  For me I help because they need(ed) it and I am the only one willing.   If I treated them the way they treated me that's means I am no different than them and have no room to talk or be hurt by their actions. I also believe that vengeance is not mine. I am only answerable for my actions not theirs.  Good boundaries are vital when we decide to help our elder parents or anybody for that matter.

My mother was mentally ill while I was growing up and I suffered greatly at her hands whether she was intentionally abusive or not. My father was pretty much not around b/c he was working to support her me and her mother who lived with us contributing greatly to the enormous chaos in the home.

'Blood ties' have nothing to do with it in my case b/c these are not my biological parents but my adoptive ones.  Personal integrity has a lot to do with who steps up to care for their parents in their old age too regardless of how they were or were not raised I believe. We have to overlook many things in order to do what's necessary for them as they age get sick need help medical attention doctors living arrangements etc. etc.   So again at the root of 'why' is Love in my opinion. Nothing else really matters at the end of the day. If I love you I will do whatever I have to do to make sure you are properly cared for safe and as happy as possible.

This is because the child was \"raised to be\" what they are--afraid of the parent obligated to the parent starved for the parent's approval. I had just about the best parents in the world. They raised me to be independent to know that the world would require that of me to go out on my own and make my own life and family to care for THEM in the best way I was able. They made themselves safe and comfortable by moving into a village in which care could progress for them as needed allowing them first a duplex then into apartment then onto different levels of care when needed. They saved all their lives so as not to be dependent on their children. They taught US my brother and me how to save. It is the eagle story you know. The eagle's nest is on an island and there is a terrible storm and the eagle must try to save it's eaglets as the waters rise. First the father takes one eaglet across the raging waters. During the flight he asks the babe \"And when I am old and tired will you save me alike\" and the chick replies \"Oh yes father; I WILL\" and this eaglet the father bird drops at once into the raging waters where it quickly perishes. The father goes then for the next and last babe and while crossing asks the same question of it. The baby answers \"Oh father I am so sorry; I cannot promise you this. But I promise you I will carry your lesson for life and I will do all I can to save my OWN babies\". This chick was carried to safety. The way of it is that our parents have children whether by choice happenstance. They do all they can for them given their limitations. And the children should pay this forward.

Maybe its the word 'owe' that is the problem. I do believe that no child abused by a parent should physically care for that parent. I don't think we should give up jobs and our homes to care for them. Bringing them into our homes is not always a good thing either.   Once we leave our parents home we really can't go back. (I had to and 1 year was enough) We change. We grow and mature. We have different experiences than our parents. Our views are no longer the same. We are now adults with jobs homes and our own families. But as we age so do our parents. They need to rely on someone and it should be their children. And as children we should at least make sure they are safe and cared for. Help find them resources. Set them up in a care facility. You can then walk away.   In a perfect world the child graduates from high school and maybe college. At that point the child starts a life of their own. Marries at that point that family becomes #1. Once the nest is empty the parent should be finding things that interest them get involved. New stage in their life. Neither child or parent should need to rely on each other. But that's not the real world. We have children who rely on parents to live and visa versa. Both spending money they don't have. Drugs and alcohol go both ways.   Its a shame that there is abuse in families and those who did the abusing then expect that child to care for them in their old age. And its a shame that that child feels obligated. In that situation a child needs to know its OK to walk away. We all need to set BOUNDRIES. What we can do and what we can't do. And it would be nice if our parents excepted this and did what needed to be done to be safe and cared for. Can't keep your house up then you downsize. Need 24/7 care then you go to an AL or LTC. You don't ask ur children to give up their lives so you can continue to live in a dream world. Its not being independent when you expect a child to do all the work and sacrifice so you can stay put.

He still loves pretty much anything made with a cream sauce. In Girl Scouts I learned to make \"tuna wiggle\" also a cream sauce but with canned tuna and peas in it; could also be made with shrimp but that was too expensive for the Girl Scouts. Served on toast or over rice. Also often made with Campbell's cream soup mushroom or celery. My husband also said that his dad would eat something he called \"super deluxe\" which was basically bread with gravy but the dad gave it a fancy name and made a big deal out of it so the kids thought it was wonderful. This would be for a snack or light supper. Also for a snack or light supper people would have bread and milk (hot or cold) or \"milk toast\" which was buttered toast with hot milk poured over it. Did anyone have codfish cakes growing up? You had to soak dried salt cod for quite a while changing the water frequently to get out most of the salt then mixed with mashed potatoes formed into patties and fried. For us is was a treat but in past generations it was considered poor person's food because salt cod and potatoes were both very cheap. Someone mentioned peanut butter and lettuce sandwiches; we used to like peanut butter with sliced banana or with crumbled bacon. I used to love canned black bean soup which we had often for lunch when I was young but I haven't seen it in years--not the kinds with whole black beans which is still available but the kind where the beans are pureed.

She told me that if I ever got angry with you I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.' The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two Precious dolls were in the box.

Hamburgers and hot dogs were usually served as is and eaten with a fork putting them on a bun with a handful of potato chips on the side was special.  We like visits to my grandmother's house because she always had bottles of pop on hand and popsicles. You broke the popsicles in half to share and the pop was poured in a glass and shared too.

I still eat pancakes this way and will do the same with a waffle.

Don\u2019t blame you one bit for mentioning that this behavior was \u2018a bit much.\u2019   Do you find this to be a more common attitude now than in the past? I do. Parenting has changed. I realize that we are always evolving as a society. Shouldn\u2019t certain rules be timeless such as respecting others?   I don\u2019t know about you but we got a swat on the butt for misbehaving or a ruler smacked on our wrist by a nun at school.. That either caused a kid to behave or in some cases kids rebelled.   My parents certainly didn\u2019t \u2018abuse\u2019 us. This was customary at the time. I actually found a swat on my butt less painful than if I was told that I couldn\u2019t hang out with my friends. I am NOT saying that we should go back to physically hitting children. I don\u2019t think that behavior should be laughed off though.   I was taught to respect my parents grandparents aunts uncles godparents teachers neighbors basically any adult in our lives but my mom was extremely fair by showing me that we as children were to be respected too.   I will never forget that my sixth grade teacher treated me horribly because my oldest brother had misbehaved in her class. I had straight A\u2019s in her class and this teacher was terribly mean to me even though I had never misbehaved in her class.   My mom went to see this teacher and said \u201cPlease don\u2019t treat my daughter unfairly. Yes my son misbehaved in your class and he deserved to be disciplined but my daughter has been a good student with good behavior since kindergarten.\u201d After my mom spoke to my teacher I didn\u2019t have any further problems with her.

{"post_id": "474037", "title": "Medicare keeps taking money from my social security check.", "body": ["<p>On 8/28/2017 I was bitten by a neighbor's dog. The bite didn\u2019t require stitches, so I went to my doctor on 8/29 to just get it checked out. That was the only visit and treatment I ever received for the dog bite. Since I had Medicare that was who the doctor's office charged for the visit. My daughter had a lawyer on retainer and suggested I file a claim. The lawyer was able to get a judgement for me and retained $235.00 for Medicare. The money sat in the account for several years. I called and asked had it been taken care of and was told after several calls, that they would call me when things were settled. Fast forward, I start receiving threatening letters from Medicare saying I owe them over $3,000.00. With an attachment of over 20 pages of charges they said are related to the dog bite. The charges included knee surgery, visits to a Dr. I see monthly and had been seeing since before the dog bite. I call my lawyer and leave a message that it\u2019s been way over 3 years since this happened and he needs to get his behind in gear and take care of this. His reply was a letter saying that he was no longer my attorney and that he took my suggestion as a threat and was going to call the sheriff on me. He still has the $235.00 in addition to the percentage he collected. Then Medicare comes for me telling me that I owe this $3,000+ and they are going to be taking 15% of my social security check and charging interest as well. I called TOP, Coast Professionals (who make the debt calls) and told them that there was ONLY 1 visit related to the bite. She told me I could send a copy of the billing for the bite and they could get the record adjusted. I got that, called to say I was sending it, she then said that I would also have to get letters from all the other 70+ service providers saying they hadn\u2019t treated me for the dog bite. I spoke with a gentleman named Ken at another number I called who agreed with me saying that my real financial liability was only $90.00. He was at NGHP. But that I would have to talk to Coast Professionals. He said I should get my money back but he couldn\u2019t say when that might be. I don\u2019t know the motivation of the person making out the report for me that day. They had the ICD codes they knew what was what. But here I sit having sold my jewelry just trying to pay my bills. I don\u2019t have much left to sell my wedding ring and engagement ring are gone. I have a few gold chains left. I\u2019m afraid to pawn my car. I couldn\u2019t pay it back and I\u2019d lose my car too. I don\u2019t know if you can help me but maybe the people who are reading this will be forewarned to just pay the bill don\u2019t wait for Medicare to call one day. The biggest thing in all of this is why that person at Medicare put together a recovery summary they knew was wrong, and I\u2019m afraid of when the bills come and I don\u2019t have anything left to sell.</p>"], "date": "2022-04-02 20:34:34", "user_name": "Toodistressed", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Financial Planning", "Medicare", "Paying for Care"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/medicare-keeps-taking-money-from-my-social-security-check-474037.htm"},

She has latched onto a fellow resident a chap who is a good 20 years younger than her to run around and basically do things for her that she can't be bothered to do for herself.

Typically mother says as she finds masks bothersome she (selfishly) won't be wearing them even though the general advice is to do so.

Last Friday my DH had enough of the BS and went over to my mom's to talk to her. I had no idea what he was going to say and he is very blunt in general but off he went. Well one of the first things he told her was that if things don't change then WE are moving and he specifically told her where making it clear that discussions were indeed taking place.   That must have shocked her because she did a complete turn around. I got an apology an \"I love you\" and she has agreed to a companion aid 4 hours a week.  I'm going online later to look for an aid. Really hope this works out.  Of course my update has to include another zinger too. She also made an appointment with a local back surgeon for this week. As soon as we had our \"truce\" she asked me to fill out the new patient paperwork. I knew this opiate thing was looming too. I'm letting the doctor handle that 100%.

I have 3 more in the trunk of my car waiting for \"someone to steal her bras\" again and for her to need new ones. Sigh. She's had 2 more falls recently bringing the total up to 76.

Austin Miles 1912  Songwriters C. Austin Miles Published by Public Domain The Story Behind In The Garden Here is the account of how this beautiful hymn was written from the hymn writer C. Austin Miles himself \u201cOne day in April 1912 I was seated in the dark room where I kept my photographic equipment and also my organ. I drew my Bible toward me and it opened at my favorite book and chapter John chapter twenty. I don\u2019t know if this was by chance or by the work of the Holy Spirit. I will let you the reader decide. That story of Jesus and Mary in\u00a0 John 20\u00a0had lost none of its power and charm. It was though I was in a trance as I read it that day I seemed to be part of the scene. I became a silent witness to that dramatic moment in Mary\u2019s life when she knelt before her Lord and cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I rested my hands on the open Bible as I stared at the light blue wall. As the light faded I seemed to be standing at the entrance of a garden looking down a gently winding path shaded by olive branches. A woman in white with head bowed hand clasping her throat as if to choke back her sobs walked slowly into the shadows. It was Mary. As she came unto the tomb upon which she placed her hand she bent over to look in and ran away. John in a flowing robe appeared looking at the tomb. Then came Peter who entered the tomb followed slowly by John. As they departed Mary reappeared leaning her head upon her arm at the tomb she wept. Turning herself she saw Jesus standing there so did I. I knew it was He. She knelt before Him with arms outstretched and looking into His face cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I awakened in sunlight gripping my Bible with my muscles tense and nerves vibrating under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. I wrote as quickly as the words could be formed the lyrics exactly as it is sung today. That same evening I wrote the tune. It is sung today as it was written in 1912.\u201d", "date": "2022-04-03 23:27:31", "user_name": "smeshque", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/count-your-blessings-435930.htm"},

I can only guess that you've not been a caregiver for long and perhaps still have your rose colored glasses on. Don't worry the longer you will have to do it things will become more clear to you and hopefully we can be there for you when you're at your wits end and ready to rip your hair out.  I've been on this forum for several years now and even though my husband died in 2020 I continue to try and help others with whatever information I think may be helpful for them as I feel I have learned a lot while caring for my husband for over 24 years.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "This forum is depressing.", "body": "Here's how the cow chews the cud James: support groups are formed because there's a need for support. There's a need for support on a site like this b/c caregivers to elders in general are burned out exhausted and devastated b/c they've devoted their lives to loved ones who basically do not appreciate their effort; who complain &amp; treat them like dirt in return. So we're here to vent; to ask for help ideas tips support and to hear that we're not alone when we feel like we're falling off the edge of the Earth. You're not hearing positive stories b/c there are very FEW positive stories to share. Aside from yours that is.  You on the other hand are in an atypical situation where you're thrilled to be caring for your mom for the past 14 years thrilled to have given up your former life to do so thrilled to be 'relaxing' and to have quit your job given up your freedoms friends girlfriends concerts and all the rest of it in exchange for your caregiving duties. Which is great for YOU and you should be applauded for your devotion to your mother who apparently loves &amp; appreciates all of your efforts.  But that scenario is suited to probably 3% of the planet if that in reality. So to come here to this forum and expect to hear YOUR stories uplifting and 'non-depressing' stories such as the one you're telling is about as likely as a snowstorm in Florida in August truthfully. You don't like people telling you how YOUR story is off-the-wall yet you're here telling us OUR stories are off the wall or depressing? This is OUR reality James and for us it's an UGLY reality whether you agree with it or not. Because caregiving to elders IS a hard &amp; ugly job as you may find out yourself if your mother becomes incontinent &amp; dementia ridden &amp; starts playing with her feces &amp; spreading it all over the walls the bed &amp; the furniture. Then you may decide to come back to AC &amp; seek some of the support you once found to be 'so depressing' huh?  The vast majority of us are not 'relaxing' or 'enjoying' our time watching TV or fiddling around on a computer. I can tell you I DO have a cell phone which rang continuously with calls from my parent's ALF with them telling me of mom's falls all 95 of them. With calls from their doctors and nurses and hospice and EMTs and ambulance companies and specialists and hospitals and rehabs and mortuaries and moving companies for the SEVEN MOVES I've made for them and and AND. Because for most of us that's part of Real Life which you have managed to bow out of for the most part aside from staying home and relaxing and answering calls from your mother which you 'don't mind doing at all'. Which is your prerogative certainly.  But please reserve YOUR judgment for US like you've been telling US to do for YOU.  I don't like Twitter; I find it depressing and rather offensive.

All of the companies are screened. They have had a lot of success at both ends. It was on the \"Today\" Show.  It's sounds like you and hubby jumped in and did a remarkable job reversing everything. You should both be commended.  You are doing an absolutely fabulous job! Keep in mind years' ago someone once said to me \"You can let people rock your boat but don't let them tip you over in it\". I think you get my message.  You are trying to give I assume (your mother-in-law) dignity and quality of life. You also sound like you have \"order\" in your life. When you are caregiving you have to keep some people at bay. I am organized just like you neat on time people remarked how orderly and \"peaceful\" everything is. Peaceful I repeat. This doesn't happen on it's own. It's by keeping a routine schedule and being a good steward over what you do have (materials things living arrangement etc.)  Don't let other people's \"erratic\" behavior come into your castle. It's takes work it takes declining \"some not all\" invitations and you set the schedule for visitations with your mother-in-law. When they visit \"the troublemakers\" you give them a window for example Mom is at her best in the morning from 10AM-12 Noon. Tell them we have appointment to get to that gets them out the door.  I don't imagine this sibling ever shows up with a box of pastry or flowers and asks you \"do you need anything\"? You have to take control which you certainly have and limit contact with the sibling who will destroy everything you built.  I am the female version of Felix Unger so I have my quirky ways we all do. But I insist on keeping my small place with Mom a place of beauty. And some people seek out to destroy that. Don't be polite about this.    The one's that make the most noise usually do the least and usually get the most attention and resources in the family. Unfortunately oftentimes their situation never improves. We all have a relative or (2) who needs a little help now and then along the way and you pitch in and they get on their feet--a death divorce sickness job loss--life happens. But for other's it can be lifelong with no end or improvement of any kind in sight. I call it the kitten who lost their mittens. They always have a problem. Probably more than what you can provide. More like they need professional help-social worker retraining skills perhaps housing and food voucher. They need to be assessed but you can't do everything.   Stay centered.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "Hello I am new to caregiving on 24/7 basis.   My mother-in-law is 77.  For 8 years since my father-in-law passed my husband's sibling and adult children have taken advantage of her; stripped her financially destroyed her property stole whatever they could to support their addictions. They left their dogs for her to care for (11?) and the list goes on. Anyway the house was full of rodents roaches a large rat snake (not a pet) holes in the walls and floors falling through.   Mom did not want to leave her husband died here so my husband left his job moved to his mom's removed all the human rats and spent 2 years cleaning the property and getting ready for a new home be put on it for her.   My husband found homes for multiple dogs so now we are down to 4 outside and 2 inside) and the new home was put on the property. Now we are getting ready to remove the remaining debris.  However Mom's personal care got to be too much for hubby alone so I retired from my position - he picked up a local job and now I care for mom 24/7.   When I was working I bought mom all new clothes bedding towels drapes furniture appliances etc...so everything was ready for the new house.   To present....So far it has been pretty easy...I clean and do laundry in the AM. She gets up around noon then the rest of the day belongs to her. Typically every other day begins with giving her a shower doing her hair cleaning her bed and bath rooms cooking breakfast massaging her knees and feet and cleaning up incontinence issues as they occur throughout the day - which occassionally means multiple showers.  Her bedroom is cleaned regularly and her 2 little inside dogs (one is mostly house trained the other one poops and pees wherever she feels like it probably because she is a senior dog) - are cared for; fed and bathed.  Mom has since progressed wonderfully in many ways - health wise. Her skin and face looks fresh the arthritic swelling in her knees (which made wearing pants difficult for her) has significantly gone down and she is now able to move around her new home much easier.   Problem 1: One sibling. Everything is drama and most of the time this sibling needs money. - which mom always tries to give. Last year the child demanded a lot of money for a downpayment on a car...literally bullied her until it was received -- and it is like this most every month. Its always something leaving Mom upset and wanting to give whatever money is \"needed\" to this child.   When we explain there is no money to give the bullying gets worse mom gets stressed and anxious her memory lapses she gets confused angry and frustrated. She talks about selling everything going to a nursing home or just dying. It literally takes a couple of days to calm her down.   This sibling hasn't been over for 2 weeks now..mom is starting to flourish though she still calls this sibling everyday.   Problem 2. I will have start working again soon. I am applying for work-from-home positions. Though finding something legit is proving difficult.  So coping: I think I am doing okay.  I do feel a little isolated at times not too bad..Financially we are stressed. I don't sleep well but thats my age I think.", "date": "2022-03-07 09:58:50", "user_name": "Louise4", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/how-are-you-coping-187022.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

Well that woman just so happens to be my Husband's biological mom. He moved in with her into the house he grew up in back in 2011. She just couldn't keep up with all the responsibilities of the property and at the time he was single so he was happy to help. Back then he could work a full time job and not worry about his mom being alone all day. Now fast forward 11 years and I am the one providing the care for his mom who cannot be left alone period! I married him he has 4 other siblings who do nothing but criticize and gossip about me when they are together yet they don't help with 87 yearold mom. The x son in law helps more than her own kids except my husband. I'm here with her all day while my husband is at work. And when his siblings practically scared and threatened me into the position claiming I never \"went upstairs to help\" considering that my husband's sister lived upstairs with her and I did go up there but the sister was not mentally stable what so ever and I couldn't be around her she would accuse me of stealing from her and she would get physically violent at times. Plus I did all the house work and made sure all the garbage on the property was up on the road every week and cleaned up the property plus I took care of my 14 yearold son and husband on top of cleaning after his sister and aging mom. So the truth is she financially took advantage of the situation did nothing to benefit anyone in the house made more messes and verbally abused her mom for what? To get a free ticket out of our house and get taken care of by sis telling the sis that my husband and I do nothing for his mom that I never go upstairs when she was the reason why I couldn't sometimes to up there.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "My 91 year old father moved in with my husband and I a little over two months ago. He fell at home (he lives 10 minutes away - we've always been a close family) and fractured his pelvis spent a few weeks in rehab. Our house is a two family and my sister lives upstairs (it's not a big two family - 2 beds downstairs and one up a bathroom on each floor). The facility specifically told us that my father could no longer live by himself. My sister works full-time and is single so she cannot care for him during the day. I've been working part-time off and on for years family has always been a priority so caregiving fell on my shoulders. Just seemed to make sense to move Dad into our house so he wouldn't be alone and I could still take care of the pets and everything else. We rented a van and moved our college aged daughter into my old bedroom at his house (she's away at school) and my father took her room at our house. My sister moved some of her things into his house in her old room and kept some of her things in her apartment upstairs (my father was very worried that someone would break into his house and didn't want it sitting empty - we figured one less thing for him to worry about). Basically everyone's life was uprooted. The first couple of weeks my father was literally awake all the time. The rehab facility changed his medication and added some new drugs that really did not agree with him. His doctor prescribed additional medication to help him sleep - it woke him up and made him more confused. It took a while to get his medications straightened out but we did. Showering was an issue - thankfully my husband volunteered for the job. Incontinence is an issue. He still gets the urge to use the bathroom but can't make it. So he wears adult diapers. Only problem is that he still thinks he has to run to the bathroom. So he was doing this at night and not putting the diaper back on properly or just not putting it back on at all. So there were many many night time accidents. And like a child he woke us up nightly screaming he was wet (him the bed everything needed to be changed all hours of the night). So I was constantly washing something - my dryer called it quits after two weeks (I completely understood - it was a lot of work).   He has physical and occupational therapy a few times a week at home along with a visiting nurse. The therapy helps a lot but feels like my home has a revolving door - always someone stopping by for something. My dogs are always barking at someone. The therapy has helped him immensely. My father is walking much better with a cane and has learned how to properly use the bathroom and potty chair in his room. The occupational therapist worked with him and he no longer wets the bed at night the way he was when he first moved in. Biggest problem right now is his constant craving for attention and severe memory loss. If he wakes up at 3 in the morning he thinks we're all ignoring him (we're sleeping). I keep reminding myself that it's all new for all of us him included. It's not easy and I don't know what the future holds.Some days are good and some days are tough.

Lucky you did not break anything. Sorry about not getting support form your mother. She might be aware of your problem at first but forgot. Try not to take it personally. I know it is hard but you do not need any added stress. That is what I do most of the time and if it still bothers you I would have a serious discussion and explain your feeling. You would feel better once you get it off your chest. I had some major health problems in the past and I told my mother and she felt bad in the moment and then forgot about my problem. I wanted her support more than anyone else in the world at a time in my life when I could have died but with her memory loss the support was only there for a brief period of time. My mother was always concerned about her family. She would always put others first. As a declining elder and lots of health problems she has been more focused on herself. I do not take it personally because she was never like that before and I know it is difficult for her. I love her unconditionally. It is difficult to see some changes in her but mostly she is her sweet self.  I hope you start to feel better soon. It might have been lots of stress that caused to to fall and hit your head. It happened to me while my mom was in the ER. I had new shoes on and was rushing to let my niece in the door to the ER and my foot got stuck to the tile floor and I took a flip and hit my head against the wall I was on blood thineeres at the time.. I was in the same room as my mother overnight. It was definately stress and lack of sleep. Take care of yourelf get support from other family members if possible and get help when needed. Sending my thought snd prayers to you. Hope you have a quick recovery.

I phoned my mother to explain what had happened and that I would be unable to drive over for the next week or so.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "For those of you who are caregiving and living with the person you are caring for 24/7, how are you coping?", "body": "Not sure if this thread is still monitored but in answer to the question one day at a time. My parents moved in with me back in 2019; my dad had Parkinson's &amp; mom was worn out from caregiving for him. He was a piece of work; used to being independent and being the boss but with the PD the filter that used to keep him at least nominally interested in other people disappeared. He passed away after a hospitalization in 2020 - probably a PE but a blessing/release in any case.   So now it's just mom living with me. I bought a house for them to move in with me because my condo would not have worked (stairs). Overextended myself on it but it's done. All of their stuff is in the main part of the house; I have my own room/bathroom but just about everything else is hers. My stuff is in the basement as is the rest of hers because when we moved God forbid we got rid of too much. Dishes pots/pans etc. that never get used but have to be unpacked &amp; put on shelves... (\uff0d\u2038\u10da).   I ended up spreading my own furniture out to occupy the space I needed to avoid having her ideas take over the basement too. My dad didn't leave her with much financially and what she had left after their house sold is almost gone because she just buys things we don't need. Retail therapy.   She's had a cough for 4 months now - her dr is treating the symptoms which is about all he can do since the likely reason for it is she eats too much of the wrong things (wheat dairy etc.). I think she has an eating disorder - she used to be quite heavy but had gastric bypass followed by several other complications. She has plenty of energy to shop or cook all over the kitchen but gets exhausted if she has to do anything she doesn't want to do.   I get that some of this is probably backlash from being my dad's caregiver herself for so many years; he wasn't a kind man before PD &amp; she's a retired nurse so there was a lot she did that probably most wouldn't have done. But sure as she feels the least bit neglected she gets \"sick\" which then becomes an actual sickness requiring attention &amp; reassurance.   I have no friends that aren't also now her friends because she's competitive about it - had to go meet my co-workers so now I don't even have that. We go to church when she's up to it - which she hasn't been for weeks because she's self-conscious about the coughing. Yes she has asthma but again cutting out the wheat and dairy help that too - can't cut that out though because that's what she eats: sandwiches with meat and cheese...   I've been working from home for the last almost 2 weeks because we caught whatever bug is floating around; she got dehydrated and dizzy/unsteady. She's better today (drinking more water) &amp; I'm looking forward to going back to the office but then what? She sits at home &amp; waits for me to come home instead of making new friends or contacting the ones she has. I'm not her husband - I'm her daughter....   She won't take care of herself because she knows that I will - sister moved out of the country to not have to deal with this. 2 brothers live in different states - bless them they both have had her stay with them for a week here &amp; there but now mom is not comfortable flying by herself &amp; wants me to go with her. Doesn't get that part of these trips is giving me a break &amp; God forbid anyone should actually say that - she'd go into a funk &amp; throw it up in my face for the rest of her life. NH is not an option at all. Couldn't do it.   She has no hobbies &amp; doesn't want any friends that aren't associated with the church. More &amp; more dependent &amp; enmeshed as the days go by &amp; I'm the bad rotten terrible person who can't say anything because other people do not get it. I love my mom - I really do! - and I was so glad that they moved here instead of being 750 miles away but she's overly dependent &amp; needy &amp; it's getting harder to handle. So one day at a time.

Drop her a** off at a hospital ER and tell them you're done and can't do it anymore. Or pack her bags and pick a sibling. Then leave her and her belongings on their doorstep. Ring the bell once and drive away. I see some of the stories on this forum and I say OMG! big-time. I'm able to be a caregiver to my mother. We have been able to come to an amicable arrangement that is beneficial to us both because she knows I'd do exactly one of those two things.  I don't play any games. I don't tolerate a moment of stubbornness or instigating or gaslighting or guilt-tripping or passive/aggressive nonsense. I won't have any drama or 'performances' to get attention or to sabotage a special occasion. I do right by her but it's on my terms not hers. She also knows that if dementia shows up to the party I will stop being her caregiver. My sister does not help out but she's least decent and has some respect. I wish you all the best and hope you find a different arrangement for your mother soon.", "date": "2022-04-02 23:38:42", "user_name": "BurntCaregiver", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm"},

I have Been BLISSFULLY no contact since March of 2020 \ud83d\ude03 lots of drama regarding her living in our rental with roommates and hoarding. To many comments and shitty behaviors towards me an my only child Dear Husband.  My husband hasn\u2019t seen his mother since he moved her out of the rental in July of 2020. Yes her crap and roommates crap stayed in our rental for months! I had to send a formal letter stating we would pay 1 month of storage. Mind you she had help from my husband our daughter (17) and flying monkeys to move.  DH has finally come out of the FOG. He still has some work to do in regards to her guilting him over the phone. He hasn\u2019t seen her since July 2020.  Her bday is this weekend and he has offered to have our daughter drive her and her FM (flying monkey) to our cabin property that has been passed to him. Falling apart when we got it.  Im worried she is going to pull some form of guilt and he will get into a funk/bad mood. I\u2019m hoping that DD driving her 1-1/2 hours to and from the property will alleviate her guilting him on the car ride if he had to take her lol. She only shows her crappy side to DH her brother and me. DD is my child from a previous marriage\u2026 so she\u2019s not family (MIL words)  Im torn between wanting her to behave and wanting her to mess up. DH said if she acts up\u2026he has done his diligence in trying to spend time with her.  I refuse to get her a gift. He bought her a card. In the past we would splurge and take her out and she would invite her FM and order to the nines. Also would invite herself and 2 uncles b-day (they don\u2019t get along) they ordered over $350 worth of cocktails and surf/turf grrrr many more stories of her thinking we are her piggy bank (she can well afford things btw) sorry got side tracked \ud83d\ude02.  hugs to you guys in healing from these Monsters!  oh yeah (ex-foster child here) she has stated more than once to me that we should do things for her because \u201cI know you don\u2019t know this but that\u2019s what family should do\u201d her words.

Wondering why they were like this was a waste of time and energy for me. It is what it is. After mother died and the estate was settled I cut contact with my sib. It was the right move for me. I'm not saying any of this was easy. It wasn't but I learned to deal with it.   glad -happy for you that the job is going so well so far. I read your other posts about your AirBnB. Yikes!!! I think you have gone the right route reporting them. Hopefully some positive changes will be made. It must have been nice being home in your own bed for a little time.   sharyn - not nice that Nancy is very ill and also has an abusive sibling. Nancy has to put herself first and let others deal with her sister. That may mean having little contact. Nancy sounds like she was a lovely friend to your mother. I am sorry she is facing this. You say you are feeling low and down on yourself. Please give yourself a pat on the back for being a great help to your mother when she was going through dementia and also for being a great grandma to your grand-twins and a great mother to your children. Do something good for you -something that will pep you up. Hope senior kitty is still doing well.  I'm still working on treatments for the CFS. I definitely need more energy. MCT oil (bullet proof coffee) seems to help. It's early to say that this is reliable in an ongoing sense but every bit helps!!!  Since mother passing and cutting contact with sis my mind's peace has increased. It's over three years since mother passed and about 9 months since I cut contact with sis. There s no doubt that my quality of life has improved despite other difficult things that have arisen. My dd is recovering from her second chemo and doing well. The next one will see her half way through the chemo. She's not worried about the surgery at all which is good. After that comes the radiation.

This family member in Utah did get POA. How can they help her when she is difficult and combative?

Find a facility that has a security system where they use a security bracelet on her sister so if she tries to leave the bracelet will set off alarms. My understanding is the family member trying to take care of Nancy\u2019s sister is older as well.   Nancy says she can\u2019t talk with her sister because she gets difficult accusing them of taking her money and home from her. I suggested redirecting her thoughts to things they know her sister enjoys\u2026.knitting gardening etc.   I also suggested if there is a family member who can gain her trust a granddaughter/grandson/niece etc that can help as well. If you all remember my mom did not trust my sister yet she trusted me and I could work with my mom to get her to be more cooperative.   if any of you have more suggestions to help Nancy I would appreciate it. Nancy was a blessing to us and I want to try to help her any way I can", "date": "2022-03-27 02:12:33", "user_name": "SharynMMarie", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm"},

That\u2019s not my personal email though it\u2019s a company email.  I thought The whole point of this forum was how coming from dysfunctional families can add weight to caregiving. My only purpose of sharing something either from my own personal experience website or information I know of that was to share something supportive of caregivers.   Because of my knowledge and experience of the many issues and daily challenges of caregivers especially individuals working 24/7 without a support system my purpose is to help outside siblings to see that their daily challenges is everyone\u2019s problem and crisis in the family. This is especially true if the person is a sick parent with adult children.   We hear a lot about caregiving burnout and how this can take a physical and emotional toll on the caregivers health but unless you are the sibling working without support you may not be aware of what they go through.   I\u2019ve seen videos and information a wealth of information that shows if that Main Family Caregivers health breakdown then the family could have two sick people needing help the caregiver and the person needing care and the burden of responsibility could fall on another sibling unexpectedly.   I know of a personal experience where this happened in a family that did not communicate like they should with each other about their mothers health with dementia. One weekend out of no where that sibling decided to take Momma to visit another sibling for the weekend with the intention of leaving her. This is exactly what they did and overnight that siblings life and household changed.   This is why for families that can put aside any differences when a love one needs total care if they can have a plan of action in place and learn how to work together it can take some of the load off of just one individual and the burden of responsibility does not have to be placed abruptly on another sibling.   When a medical situation happens that forces a family member to need total care many families are at a lost of what to do. This only adds to an already dysfunctional family. How nice it is if people are aware that there may be other options task and responsibilities each member can take on. But is starts by members being willing to put aside their differences and look at the problem at hand as \u201cOur Family Crisis Our Family Emergency.\u201d", "date": "2022-03-26 00:52:10", "user_name": "LynnelT4shs", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm"},

I agree it is so hard for individuals especially the Main Family Caregiver to convince other siblings living outside of the home of what Never Ending Caregiving can do to the caregiver Physically and Emotionally!   It is for this reason I created an online program to help these individuals AND THEIR OUTSIDE SIBLINGS see that this crisis is EVERYONES crisis. I demonstrate the sad consequences and reality of what can happen if these individuals are not supported and give practical suggestions and a list of at least 10 task these outside siblings can do to be supportive even if they live in another state.

I received my Associates and am continuing on this fall towards my BSN. We shall see what God has in store. I will tell you that going to school at this time in my life has been possibly foolish and super difficult. But with God's help I am managing.   AB had 2 more episodes. We finally hired some help for him because Mom is my priority and well I just cannot do it all you all have taught me that. :) Mom is doing well God really takes good care of that woman. She has a check up next week.  The goats are so cute and quite therapeutic for me. I just love having them as pets. DH says we will not worry about milking until I have completed school.

It is COLD!!! So I have 7 goat babies. Sarah had her two on the 25th of Jan. A boy and a Girl Jada and Job. Rebecca had hers on the 26th two girls and a boy Zeeb Mary and Rhoda. Abigail had hers on the 28th two sweet girls Chloe and Phoebe. All Bible names. :) I had to help Rebecca and Abigail Deliver they had some issues. It was the most amazing scary exciting and beautiful thing I have ever gotten to do. It was Awesome to say the least. Sarah had no issues and actually kidded in between my 30 minute checks on them. It was quick for her. I stayed with Abigail all night before she delivered because I knew it was anytime and her being a first timer I wanted to make sure I was there if she had trouble which she did. In a few weeks we will be milking. We had to sell the 2 wethers. DH decided no males if we are going to have dairy goats. Because we rent a buck as needed. I did not want to sell them because they were sweethearts but they went to good homes. Now we are going to have some issues because Job has become special to me he is a sweetheart and I don't know if I will be able to sell him. I would like to keep him and breed him to the girls minus his mother and sister of course. But anyway we will see.  Lesson learned I will never again breed my does to kid in the middle of winter.   I have been staying tired with all thats going on and just don't seem to find and \"free\" time to do the things I wish to do.

I hope you all have a better Year than the last. I have missed you all dearly.  My does are due to kid any day now. I have been studying up on being a goat midwife :) My plate has been super full for a while now which is why I have not been able to visit here like I want. But I think of you all often and keep you in my prayers. I was studying Acts 27 this week and I found in it some things I never really thought about before and I have read that chapter many times over. Just thought I would share my thoughts on some of the verses. This is when Paul was set sail to Rome.  7-11 This part of the sailing was getting dangerous due to the winds and the like. Paul attempts to warn the people of the danger but rather than listen to a man of God they listened to their human wisdom. This reminds me of Ezekiel 33 when God said if the watchman warn the people of danger and they do not listen then it is on them. Well such is the case here. This verse is similar to Christian lives if we warn people of the danger of living without Jesus and they do not listen then it is on them. But if we do no warn them it may very well be on us. But like today\u2019s culture man\u2019s wisdom trumps God\u2019s wisdom unfortunately. 12-20 After being warned by Paul and not heeding the warning the ship and passengers underwent severe troubles. And in verse 20 when it says that no stars or sun appeared in many days and they were pretty much hopeless that would be an extremely difficult part of the journey. As in life when we go through trials and we feel all hope is lost because we cannot see the rainbow because of the storm it is hard. But here comes faith in the next verses. 21-26 After a period of silence Paul speaks up. He encourages the men that everything will be ok that their lives will be spared. Paul never lost faith in God and God\u2019s plan for him. As a child of God we can have that hope \u201cand know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to HIS purpose\u201d Romans 8:28. Paul knew even before this journey set sail that he would get to Rome because that is where God wanted him to go. These passages are such a good example of life. In our journey we have hard and perilous times yet our faith in God and knowing HE is working on our behalf will bring us to the other side where HE wants us to be.  Wishing you all the best until next time.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "Believing caregivers, how do I reconcile that scripture says to put others before me whereas the secular world says put me first?", "body": "\"Beatty\"  You're welcome Beatty. I'm so glad you've read the book and found it as life-changing as I did. It actually helped me to put it into \"action\" while in an extremely toxic relationship with my half-sister who I never lived with and was 15 years older than myself. I terminated the relationship however when she was dying I did go to see her at my ex-BIL's and my mom's request. Nothing changed on her part with that visit. The day she was dying my mom aged 82 who had fallen and fractured her right wrist (driving hand) two days prior called me that morning and asked if I would drive her to the hospital which was an hour away. There was no way I would ever ever deprive my mom of seeing her daughter in spite of my own situation. We went and spent the day leaving at 4 p.m. As soon as we got back to my mom's house we received the call that my half sister had passed away.  What I liked about the book was it was extremely well written and interesting plus it had real life examples (although names were changed) and the chapters were broken down into the different relationship types it applied to once you read the introduction and first chapter. This makes it very easy to go back at any time and as you said \"re-read parts to refresh\" yourself.  Having worked in a mainstream church from 1993-1998 it's very easy to see how Christians can and do use \"guilt\" and other manipulative tactics all under the guise of Christianity. There is no harm in having the ability to use the word \"no\" when it protects yourself and the limits you want to set. In fact you absolutely should. Working on staff was where I actually learned \"how to say no.\" Even better is when you can say \"no\" without even having to give all kinds of reasons and explanations but that may take some time for some people to get to that point. I make the choice whether I want to explain my \"no\" further or not.  Whether or not your BIL and sister would intentionally do it or not only you would probably know the real answer to that since I don't know the background but I can tell you sometimes it's disguised really well and you have to be really in tune to the them. It could be that they're used to you being a \"go along with things\" type and therefore they can't imagine you not doing something they've requested from you. I think the main clue/answer is in your line about their lack of curiosity as to what plans you have and why - that to me is very telling and shows their motive.  I wish you the best moving forward and may you have the courage to do what \"you\" want to do!", "date": "2021-01-10 12:43:31", "user_name": "NobodyGetsIt", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/believing-caregivers-how-do-i-reconcile-that-scripture-says-to-put-others-before-me-whereas-the-secu-435622.htm?orderby=recent&page=2"},

No one (other than a slave in bondage) had to sacrifice their entire life to be a caregiver to an elderly person because people rarely lived to be elderly then. It's okay for you to be angry resentful and impatient at times because being a caregiver to an elderly person will bring out these feelings if you're doing it for years at a time. No one is perfect.

I brought her flowers and a root beer float for both of us. They had a hard time getting her ready so they were late bringing her out for our 11:00 am appointment. We live in a very hot climate and it was too much for her. It turned out to be an overcast windy day so the mister they placed on the ground never went towards her too much and she started to dry heave. I had to pound on the door and the nurse came out and took her back inside. I felt terrible thinking I shouldn't have had an outside visit but I was of the mindset that I may only have a small window of opportunity to take advantage of these outdoor visits because they expect another round of the virus this fall.  I'm taking my husband with me tomorrow for another visit but the minute I see her start to show signs of issues with the heat I'll shorten the visit.

Austin Miles 1912  Songwriters C. Austin Miles Published by Public Domain The Story Behind In The Garden Here is the account of how this beautiful hymn was written from the hymn writer C. Austin Miles himself \u201cOne day in April 1912 I was seated in the dark room where I kept my photographic equipment and also my organ. I drew my Bible toward me and it opened at my favorite book and chapter John chapter twenty. I don\u2019t know if this was by chance or by the work of the Holy Spirit. I will let you the reader decide. That story of Jesus and Mary in\u00a0 John 20\u00a0had lost none of its power and charm. It was though I was in a trance as I read it that day I seemed to be part of the scene. I became a silent witness to that dramatic moment in Mary\u2019s life when she knelt before her Lord and cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I rested my hands on the open Bible as I stared at the light blue wall. As the light faded I seemed to be standing at the entrance of a garden looking down a gently winding path shaded by olive branches. A woman in white with head bowed hand clasping her throat as if to choke back her sobs walked slowly into the shadows. It was Mary. As she came unto the tomb upon which she placed her hand she bent over to look in and ran away. John in a flowing robe appeared looking at the tomb. Then came Peter who entered the tomb followed slowly by John. As they departed Mary reappeared leaning her head upon her arm at the tomb she wept. Turning herself she saw Jesus standing there so did I. I knew it was He. She knelt before Him with arms outstretched and looking into His face cried \u201cRabboni\u201d. I awakened in sunlight gripping my Bible with my muscles tense and nerves vibrating under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. I wrote as quickly as the words could be formed the lyrics exactly as it is sung today. That same evening I wrote the tune. It is sung today as it was written in 1912.\u201d", "date": "2022-04-03 23:27:31", "user_name": "smeshque", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/count-your-blessings-435930.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

My dd and her dh had to say no to her adult son a while ago They would have to had borrow the money that he wanted from them. No way! He was living beyond his means. Of course that is his choice -and it is also their choice not to accommodate him. Glad you are holding firm to your boundaries and know what you can and can't do. I had to pull the plug on loaning money to my dil. It escalated and repayment was very slow and reluctant. She doesn't talk to me anymore and that's OK.   ((((((Pam)))))) I understand this so well. My sis is like your bil. She wants me to be her servant. Until your hub realizes he is being used and doesn't want to play that game anymore it will keep happening. I guess you know that already. The only thing that I can see you being able to do it set boundaries which you did by saying don't deliver let bro come and pick up his own meat. Personally I would set the limit of not buying anything more for bro. You earn money that goes into the family coffers. You have a say in how it is spent! I came to a better awareness of these kind of dynamics in my family relationships by the on-my-behalf indignation of friends as to how I was being treated. When you grow up with it you see it as normal even though it doesn't feel good. It can't feel good to your hub to be treated like this. I am glad you are supporting him in a healthier direction.  Weepy again yesterday - not sure why. Its coming up three months from the hits of ex's death and dgd and dd with lumps so I think it is a kind of grieving. I am very hopeful about her recovery but I can still see her face as she came out of her doctor's office having heard the feared cancer diagnosis.

They were not able to bring all their belongings because the contract was set up as they charged for each box they had to pack. We did not have that issue because I packed everything myself so this is a different option than what we had.   My daughter in love contacted me a week ago last Saturday. They need $1495 to pay the movers who will be delivering their belongings the next day Sunday February 27. I told her we can\u2019t. We already gave them $750 before they left California which we told them they have 2 years to pay back. They got the money from her two sisters.   we are having to cut back which includes dropping Direct TV and selling my hubs Jeep to pay off the loan.

Sounds difficult to live with but unless your hub sees there is a problem he s not likely to change. His self-centered parents trained him well. Have you sought counselling to help you deal with this and maybe set some boundaries? It must be very stressful for you.  ali - while living in a dysfun fam we learn many dysfun ways. Identifying the problem is the first and a big step. I am still a work in progress.  On the dd front good news. The chemo is working even after only one session. The lump is already smaller. She has her second session next week with some small alterations in dose to reduce the D and better meds so we are hopeful that she will not repeat what happened before.   I had a meltdown today - just too much going on. DD asked me to drive her next week to two appointments one at 9:30 and the other at 11 the next day. As much as I want to do everything I can to help her I have my limitations -particularly my age the CFS/FM and the fact that I am moving house in a few months and am downsizing and preparing to sell. Also the fact that since her diagnosis I have less support than usual and am being asked to give more than usual doesn't help either. I wish I could do whatever she needs me to I wish I could take this all away I wish I felt better and able to do more but I can't and I don't. I am coming out of a relapse and mornings are not my thing anyway. I called her and she understands and says whatever she asks is always framed with what I feel I can do and \"No I can't\" is fine but my mother's heart wants to do it and feels bad when I can't. On top of that were several smaller things which added to my frustration - once more the bank has something wrong a laptop died Google is misbehaving the plumber didn't come when he said he would and so on.

That is the passive aggressive ways of my origin family.  TS1 sent a packet yes a packet on bullying to several family members including to my mom's husband. I was caring for him and mom for four years he had general decline but still very sharp. Mom lost in the depths of dementia. TS1 was angry because I was there helping them and thought it was a result of my bullying them that I was there. Twisteds really preferred their denial at that point and thought there were no dementia problems there and TS1 never visited or assisted. She lives about 5 miles away. She was afraid of me verbally assaulting her the therapist!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  TS2 sent letters to professionals that my mom had hired over the years. The list included the CPA attorneys doctors etc. She was wanting to verify the extent of the dementia whether mom needed care what was appropriate care and the value of home care all the while telling these people what mistakes as she judged I had made in my life including my first marriage 35 years earlier even some things that went back to high school. I found out about the TS2 letter because mom's husband showed it to me. He was hurt and astounded by the accusations made against me. He and I were very close.  The TS2 letter sent to the pros was given to me by mom's husband again after it was given to him by their CPA. Again the hurt for him. I scanned and sent that to TS2 and she was angry that someone had given it to me. Of course I did not tell her where it came from.  Just a sampling of the craziness of my two twisted sisters.

I won't have any drama or 'performances' to get attention or to sabotage a special occasion. I do right by her but it's on my terms not hers.

Wondering why they were like this was a waste of time and energy for me. It is what it is. After mother died and the estate was settled I cut contact with my sib. It was the right move for me. I'm not saying any of this was easy. It wasn't but I learned to deal with it.   glad -happy for you that the job is going so well so far. I read your other posts about your AirBnB. Yikes!!! I think you have gone the right route reporting them. Hopefully some positive changes will be made. It must have been nice being home in your own bed for a little time.   sharyn - not nice that Nancy is very ill and also has an abusive sibling. Nancy has to put herself first and let others deal with her sister. That may mean having little contact. Nancy sounds like she was a lovely friend to your mother. I am sorry she is facing this. You say you are feeling low and down on yourself. Please give yourself a pat on the back for being a great help to your mother when she was going through dementia and also for being a great grandma to your grand-twins and a great mother to your children. Do something good for you -something that will pep you up. Hope senior kitty is still doing well.  I'm still working on treatments for the CFS. I definitely need more energy.

There s no doubt that my quality of life has improved despite other difficult things that have arisen. My dd is recovering from her second chemo and doing well. The next one will see her half way through the chemo. She's not worried about the surgery at all which is good. After that comes the radiation.

Today on Facebook I received a message from a friend of my mothers. She want me to call her. Which I did.    it\u2019s so sad this woman was very helpful when my mom had gotten distrustful with my sister and me. She worked my mother. She helped with my mothers financial issues which my mom did not trust us.   she told me today that her sister has dementia she lives in Utah. This friend of my mothers live in California where I lived. A family member had her placed in a faculty which she escaped from and ended up in Wyoming.   this friend of my mothers (name is Nancy) Nancy is dying from cancer and can\u2019t go to Utah to help. This family member in Utah did get POA. How can they help her when she is difficult and combative?   I suggested they find a doctor or neurologist who specializes in dementia get her on an anti depressant even if it is capsule that they can open to put in her food or something like a juice. Find a facility that has a security system where they use a security bracelet on her sister so if she tries to leave the bracelet will set off alarms. My understanding is the family member trying to take care of Nancy\u2019s sister is older as well.   Nancy says she can\u2019t talk with her sister because she gets difficult accusing them of taking her money and home from her. I suggested redirecting her thoughts to things they know her sister enjoys\u2026.knitting gardening etc.   I also suggested if there is a family member who can gain her trust a granddaughter/grandson/niece etc that can help as well. If you all remember my mom did not trust my sister yet she trusted me and I could work with my mom to get her to be more cooperative.   if any of you have more suggestions to help Nancy I would appreciate it.

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "The Caregiver & Dysfunctional Families: How are you doing?", "body": "Hello Glad I\u2019m here I appreciate your concern and especially with the point about my email. That\u2019s not my personal email though it\u2019s a company email.  I thought The whole point of this forum was how coming from dysfunctional families can add weight to caregiving. My only purpose of sharing something either from my own personal experience website or information I know of that was to share something supportive of caregivers.   Because of my knowledge and experience of the many issues and daily challenges of caregivers especially individuals working 24/7 without a support system my purpose is to help outside siblings to see that their daily challenges is everyone\u2019s problem and crisis in the family. This is especially true if the person is a sick parent with adult children.   We hear a lot about caregiving burnout and how this can take a physical and emotional toll on the caregivers health but unless you are the sibling working without support you may not be aware of what they go through.   I\u2019ve seen videos and information a wealth of information that shows if that Main Family Caregivers health breakdown then the family could have two sick people needing help the caregiver and the person needing care and the burden of responsibility could fall on another sibling unexpectedly.   I know of a personal experience where this happened in a family that did not communicate like they should with each other about their mothers health with dementia. One weekend out of no where that sibling decided to take Momma to visit another sibling for the weekend with the intention of leaving her. This is exactly what they did and overnight that siblings life and household changed.   This is why for families that can put aside any differences when a love one needs total care if they can have a plan of action in place and learn how to work together it can take some of the load off of just one individual and the burden of responsibility does not have to be placed abruptly on another sibling.   When a medical situation happens that forces a family member to need total care many families are at a lost of what to do. This only adds to an already dysfunctional family. How nice it is if people are aware that there may be other options task and responsibilities each member can take on. But is starts by members being willing to put aside their differences and look at the problem at hand as \u201cOur Family Crisis Our Family Emergency.\u201d", "date": "2022-03-26 00:52:10", "user_name": "LynnelT4shs", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

{"post_id": "ent&pa", "title": "The Caregiver & Dysfunctional Families: How are you doing?", "body": "Hello  My name is Lynnel. I want to say I am so happy that you created this thread because this is a REAL PROBLEM for many. I have over 15 years as a Professional Caregiver known as a DSP and have seen this problem as well as so many others that families have to experience in their daily challenges of 24/7 caregiving.   I agree it is so hard for individuals especially the Main Family Caregiver to convince other siblings living outside of the home of what Never Ending Caregiving can do to the caregiver Physically and Emotionally!   It is for this reason I created an online program to help these individuals AND THEIR OUTSIDE SIBLINGS see that this crisis is EVERYONES crisis. I demonstrate the sad consequences and reality of what can happen if these individuals are not supported and give practical suggestions and a list of at least 10 task these outside siblings can do to be supportive even if they live in another state.    Please let me know your comments and I hope this is helpful.

I can't say anything about anything yet they want me to participate in the care. The last few days have been like torture. I am bracing myself for the consequences of me hanging up on the sibling. I want to wish everyone some hope with my sincere words:  Life is meant to be enjoyed by all. It should wonderful. Each and every day. How other people become so mean is a mystery to me right now but obviously an answer exists. Do your best. I mean your real best. Go the extra mile Have honor. Live your own life. It's finite and you alone should determine the best way to happiness. Seek out people with the same mindset. Get professional advice if you can. There are free resources in many cities and towns. Right now the world is turmoil but it will get better. Do you part to make it better. This will create the culture of peace prosperity health and happiness for everyone.", "date": "2022-03-25 16:29:07", "user_name": "lisatrevor", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm?orderby=recent&page=1"},

I have talked with him a couple times since. He appears to be fine. Thank you all for positive thoughts and prayers. I have a feeling that any time he has a virus or infection he will be admitted to the hospital because of him taking anti rejection drugs as these drugs lower a person\u2019s immune system.   I\u2019ve also been dealing with a senior kitty with health issues and she stopped eating on Saturday. It could have been because I was transitioning her back to kitten food which has higher fat and calories which may have caused tummy upsets. I took her back to tge shelter on Monday their vet gave her additional fluids a b 12 injection and gave me an ointment to put in her ear every 24-48 hours to stimulate her appetite. They had already given the ointment in her ear. So far I have not had to give more. Today she is eating normally and she is getting lots of attention from my grandsons this week due to spring break.
