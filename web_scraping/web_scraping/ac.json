Responsible and left alone for an hour or two not a problem but not an entire day. You know the level of direction your child needs same with an adult with dementia.   You read many posts here where an elderly parent is living alone. While not a great idea but it does happen.  Use your best judgement.

{"post_id": "474136", "title": "Is it legal to leave my dad alone?", "body": "I don't know what the 'legalities' are of leaving an incapacitated elder alone but I would hire caregivers to come into your home for 4 hours a day a few days a week to start. That will acclimate him to having others around to help him b/c you simply cannot BE there 24/7 it's unrealistic and harmful for your own state of mind to do so. An elder with dementia can get into trouble alone at home in a New York minute so while it may turn out okay to leave him alone while you go for a walk you probably wouldn't feel comfy doing so ANYWAY so why do it? Hiring in home help with dad footing the bill makes the most sense b/c sooner or later it'll have to happen so you can go out for dinner and a movie or have time alone. As dad's dementia worsens you're going to need help with his care and management be assured of that. Having him get to know caregivers and be familiar with them is a very helpful tool to have in your toolbox moving forward. Know what you're in for and educate yourself on the subject here:  Understanding the Dementia Experience by Jennifer Ghent-Fuller\u00a0  https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/210580   That 33 page booklet is a good start and The 36 Hour Day is another good reference book to read and keep handy.  I would check the elder laws in your state about what constitutes neglect or contact an Elder Care attorney for clarity on that subject just to be sure. The elder will always 'tell you' he's fine and doesn't need any help at all! That's the nature of dementia and denial that anything is wrong to begin with. They often think they're capable of WAY more than they actually ARE; that's where the trouble starts too.

(Seizure was never was confirmed - except based on description from facility).  Dad was admitted and stayed in hospital for 5 days. (He hates hospitals and it is a definite trigger for a freak out which is what he had during his stay).  Hospital psych suggested taking him off Wellbutrin (because it could be dangerous for someone who has seizures) and he added the triple threat (NAMENDA LEXAPRO and DEPAKOTE). Two weeks in and back at the facility the side effects were scary (hallucinations agitation and confusion). Facility psychiatrist lowered the dose of LEXAPRO and NAMENDA and kept DEPAKOTE as is (125mg 3x a day) Fast forward 3 weeks later\u2026. The hallucinations went away but he still wasn\u2019t himself (seemed more confused and more antsy than usual) . They told me that an incident occurred that prompted aggressive behavior. Facility Psychiatrist suggested increasing NAMENDA to 250mg twice a day (they started that March 30th). \ud83e\udd71 Dad is still confused aggitated and antsy (can\u2019t sit still!)

He is a large man (6' 4\" 280 lb) and verbally sometimes physically abusive. He no longer recognizes his wife and son who are \"caring\" for him. He wanders away and has to be led back to his home because he gets lost and can't find his way back. He can't feed or dress himself. He used to be able to take his meds if they were placed in his hand. Now he just stares at them and they have to place them in his mouth. His wife is somewhat scared of him and sometimes locks herself in the bedroom to avoid him. She broke her foot recently and was in rehab for about a month. Their son (who is working) came over twice a day to make sure his father was fed and medicated. The son would like his parents to move to assisted living. I'd say this is impossible. Am I right? Does assisted living provide enough support for such a disabled man? Don't you think many nursing homes would also decline to accept such a patient? I'd advise them to get a physician to assess his state because I think they are unable to care for him and need to know if there is any hope of improvement. Of course they are hoping that his decline is temporary and soon things will improve. I'd say this is denial.

Teepa Snow has many really educational videos on YouTube and the book The 36 Hour Day is a great resource as well.  The more you know the better prepared you will be when it comes to the many faces/changes that come along with the disease.  In your profile you say something about your husband and mom being lazy. I'm guessing that probably applies to your husband but I highly doubt that it does to your mom as your moms brain is now broken and will never get any better but will only continue to get worse. And in case you weren't told by moms doctor vascular dementia is the most aggressive of all the dementias with a life expectancy of only 5 years so just know that her decline will be much faster than with many of the other dementias so it's best that you get things figured out regarding her care ASAP. If you feel that you can continue caring for her in your home with perhaps some outside help then do so. But if you don't think you can then start looking now into placing her in the appropriate facility where you can just be her advocate and daughter. It's not an easy journey that you're on but you must remember that your mom didn't choose this journey and she deserves the best care possible whether from you or from others that are more trained to deal with what lies ahead.

Especially for YOU as her caregiver and that she's living in your home! It's important for you to learn all you can and educate yourself about what lies ahead with Alzheimer's; the dementias along with behavioral issues can be very difficult to deal with to say the least.    I suggest you read this 33 page booklet (which is a free download) which has THE best information ever about managing dementia/AD and what to expect with an elder who's been diagnosed with it.  Understanding the Dementia Experience by Jennifer Ghent-Fuller\u00a0  https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/210580    Teepa Snow has some excellent videos on YouTube and the ALZ.org website is another good resource for information &amp; timelines about how the disease progresses. The 36 Hour Day is a great book in reference format which is good to look up questions about certain issues you're having with mom as they crop up. You can get it on Amazon or eBay for a used copy.  Here is a list of useful tips from her e-book I found to be excellent:    The \u201cDont's\u201d  \u00b7 Do not reason and argue  \u00b7 Do not demand that they reason or problem-solve  \u00b7 Do not demand that they remember  \u00b7 Do not demand that they get their facts straight  \u00b7 Do not correct their ideas or scold them  \u00b7 Do not reorient them  \u00b7 Do not think that they are being uncooperative on purpose  \u00b7 Do not think that they really do remember but are pretending not to  \u00b7 Do not use a \u201cbossy\u201d dictatorial attitude in care  \u00b7 Do not act with impatience  The Do's  \u00b7 Enter into their frame of reality or their 'world'  \u00b7 Be aware of their mood or state of mind  \u00b7 Use few words and simple phrases  \u00b7 OR use no words just friendly gestures and simple motions  \u00b7 Do everything slowly  \u00b7 Approach from the front  \u00b7 Wait for a slow response  \u00b7 Constantly reassure them that everything is 'OK'  \u00b7 Keep people with dementia comfortable 'in the moment' - every moment  \u00b7 Maximize use of remaining abilities  \u00b7 Limit TV or radio programs which they may feel are frighteningly real  \u00b7 Maintain privacy  \u00b7 Provide a safe physical environment  Language Needs  \u00b7 Use short words  \u00b7 Use clear and simple sentences  \u00b7 Speak slowly and calmly  \u00b7 Questions should ask for a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer  \u00b7 Talk about one thing at a time  \u00b7 Talk about concrete things; not abstract ideas  \u00b7 Use common phrases  \u00b7 Always say what you are doing  \u00b7 If they repeat their question repeat your answer as you did the first time \u00b7 Give them a longer time to process information  \u00b7 Wait patiently for a response  \u00b7 Be accepting of inappropriate answers and nonsense words  \u00b7 Speak softly soothingly and gently    Care Needs  \u00b7 Recognize that receiving personal care feels intrusive  \u00b7 Reassure with your tone and manner  \u00b7 Do one thing at a time  \u00b7 Talk through the care \u201cplay-by- play\u201d  \u00b7 Be aware of your body language and use it to communicate relaxation and reassurance  \u00b7 Be sincere  \u00b7 Use a soft soothing touch  \u00b7 Be aware of the individual\u2019s unique triggers  \u00b7 Be aware that a person with dementia may not accurately judge whether a situation is threatening to them  \u00b7 They may respond to fear pain or anxiety by defending themselves with what we call \u201caggression\u201d  \u00b7 If they become distressed stop immediately and allow them time to calm down \u2013 don\u2019t try to restart the activity right away  You need to change your behaviour to adapt to the dementia because the person with the disease cannot.    Another good book is Living in the Labyrinth: A Personal Journey Through the Maze of Alzheimer's by Diana Friel McGowin. Learn all you can about AD/dementia b/c knowledge is power!

Your mother doesn't want her caring loving giving daughter miserable or missing out on some of the very best years of your life. A lot of people and caregivers don't have those kind of mothers.

It has been replaced a few times in ER when it came out but it is very simple as long as it is done within a short time period.

That said after lots of specialized swallowing therapy he began to eat a modified diet again. I continue to tube feed one or two meals daily mostly for convenience as well as minimize his risk for aspiration. If we were not using the tube for feeding it would need to be flushed once or twice a day to keep it open.   Facilities are scrutinized if residents lose weight so they may be reluctant to take that risk. You might suggest they discontinue using the tube for feeding to see if she maintains her weight.

How many bills can ur Mom have in an AL unless there still is a house which I had to deal with. Medicaid is just a once a year renewal. Just attach info required. Medicare you get a statement showing what the provider charged what Medicare deems reasonable the 80% they paid and a balance. If medicaid for health is her secondary then the balance is usually paid in full unless she has copays or deductibles. If she any other secondary there may be a balance. Once the provider bills me the balance and it agrees to the secondary I pay the bill and discard the statements. I only keep the statements if a problem with the provider. I found the more involved I was the easier things were. The information I required while helping Mom and nephew has helped me in my own dealings with Medicare and secondary insurances.

You will be expecting to pay about 90.00 and hour though once they get it organized they will be spending likely no more than one hour a month for the billing. More for medicaid and medicare work.

You may also get a list from your elder's bank tho they are often more hesitant to give such advice due to liability concerns. You should be VERY CERTAIN you are not dealing with a financial advisor who \"calls\" him/herself a Fiduciary. These folks sell investments and make money off what they recommend.

You could ask the doctor to offer you both some guidance on what alternatives you and your Mom have knowing that she will need to live on her own instead of with you. That is one option you might consider if it is something you really want to do but ultimately any action or inaction in the situation you have described will be up to you. Your Mom and your neice have no incentive to move out if you enable them to live with you. Another thing to think about if you live in a rental unit be it a house or an apartment additional residents have to be approved by the landlord on the lease so if you have not officially added your Mom and/or your neice to the lease and your neice were to get into trouble with her possible drug activity while on the property and/or in your unit it could jeopardize your lease. If that happpened where would you be? If your niece's possible illegal drug activity is of concern to you tell her you are not willing to jeopardize your own housing and/or safety and that your hands are full with your Mom's situation limited living space and it is time for her to move on with her life. Would that be a problem or to hard to do? Most importantly what do you want to do? Letting go of your own life is not an option or should not be but that is just one opinion on what you have shared. Will be rooting for you to find a solution that best works for you.", "date": "2008-11-26 17:19:31", "user_name": "sunshinecaregiver", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/how-long-can-i-last-with-caregiving-133501.htm"},
{"post_id": "133501", "title": "How much longer can I last, I feel like my life is over?", "body": "I don't know anymore what to do. When my step father passed my mom had a bad accident and was in a nursing home to recover. One day she says oh by the way I am coming home in a week. Home meant my home because she let her home go thinking she would not leave the nursing home. The house she lived in should have been condemned a long time ago but she would not leave it. Anyway she had my niece living with her so it was a package deal when all of the sudden she was coming home. I live in a one bedroom very small house and I cannot afford to move onw hat I make. I have some handicaps myself so I cannot do the two jobs thing I tried. She got papers for help int he mail and put them to the side and never said anything to me so her case was dropped. Argh now I have to start all over again. Those forms were hard enough to understand the first time around.  My niece is a pain to be honest as she is lazy crude and rude. Her mother is a drug addict and one day shows up with a car she bought the kid. Another burden I refused to take so she got it tagged and insured some way but the kid expects me to keep her in gas so she can run the streets. She curses at my mother who then curses at me. Its getting to me so badly that I told mom something had to give and I was cursed as the lwest form of life etc. etc.   I have no help either as I said my sister is a drug addict and my brother lives in another state and is disabled and cannot work. His idea of helping is to send her expensive gifts here and there that don't pay the light bill or put food on the table. We literally had no food until a friend of mine showed up with some and she was not even grateful just telling me that when I got paid again she was demanding I get her chocolate covered cherries because dad neve went a holiday without them. She often tells me how she lost everything because I am so worthless and didnt do enough. Her house was full of mold from the weather getting inside and there were rats and even a nice old snake running through the mess. In one room it was literally piled from the floor to the ceiling. Folks I am not exaggerating and I was told she had not been declared slight of mind or whatever the proper term is so I could do nothing about it. Argh....  I am so lost she has chased away anyone who would come around with her rudeness and if she doesn't that kid does. I broke my back three years ago and to behonest I am not supposed to be able to do anything that I do like walk or go to work but all I hear is that I don't know pain until I feel her pain shut up and stop being such a bad daughter when I want to sit for a bit after work instead of rushing around to suit her.   I am at the end of my rop and I cannot cry anymore tears and I just don't think I even want to go on period.

You juggle your life and administer their financial affairs and change diapers. I would say that is the definition of caregiving at its finest. The fact that you must work doesn't make you any less of a caregiver. It just means that you are truly dedicated to caring for your parents and are trying to keep that juggling act going. Caregiving is an exhausting proposition whether one is employed full-time part-time or not at all outside of one's home. Fun for me may be a good book an early nap a drive out my favorite bookstore a long leisurely walk or dinner with a good friend. There is a lot that one can do to achieve balance in one's life. The challenge is recognizing the right timing and seizing the moment before the window of opportunity passes. It may be a cup of coffee savored before the rest of the world starts to stir a warm throw over one's shoulder as one sips the hot cup of coffee and enjoys the perfect stillness of a new morning a new day. It's all 'simple abundance' as author Sarah B. Breathnach so wonderfully describes such moments in one of her books.

It is living by the golden rule. Glad to hear that things have settled down for a bit with your parents. Caregiving is touch and go as your situation clearly describes so I find it best to slow down a lot take one thing at-a-time and I truly have learned to pick and choose. If a person who has dementia is saying something that harms no one as I see it it really is not worth arguing about the comments and agitating oneself and the person being cared for. If on the other hand there is potential danger or a potential safety issue relative to what is being said by an individual with dementia then as the caregiver my responsibility is to intervene to help avoid disastrous consequences.

Tell her she will soon see her parents siblings etc. They are excited to see her too but it will be a little wait. Agree whenever you can as you know arguing is counterproductive. This is a time to put yourself in her place. She doesn't know herself. She's frightened and wants Mommy and Daddy. She doesn\u2019t know the old lady in the mirror as herself and may even think it's someone following her.   This is a horribly frightening place for her to be and dreadful for you. There are meds that can help some of these issues but a lot of it is play acting. Talk to her a lot about what you and she are doing so she understands.  And please please get a break for yourself.

One man gets in the car and drives around the block at the end of the day so his wife thinks he is coming home from work as he did in pre-retirement times. She recognizes him when he comes in the door where before she thought he was a stranger in the house.  Dealing with the lack of congruence between realities is exhausting.

I try to keep her from getting to the rage mode because that can last a long time once she gets going. Thank goodness she had the sense to hang up. It only fuels her rage if I try to take an assertive action like hanging up.  I'm much better today. Yes I see my doctors regularly and I'm on an anti- depressant. I have had a lot of counseling in the past to try to sort out the family dysfunction. My dad was an alcoholic. I tried a counselor a couple of years ago but she wasn't very good.

We took Dad to the emergency room first and he checked of fine medically so we had to check him in for psychiatric evaluation. He couldn't speak a coherant sentence. While he was in the psych ward for 8 days my sister and I found a total dementia care locked-down assisted living facility. We knew that as he got better - back on meds no beer meals sleeping at night - up during the day he'd think he's fine and he'd be exit-seeking.  So these friends which includes my Dad's attorney who wrote the Power of Attorney and Medical Advocate for my sister and I - advised my Dad he could revoke his Power of Attorney and Medical Advocate and leave the assisted living facility and go home. We're so angry we could scream!   Now our choice is to petition for guardianship and conservator which he'll contest with the help of his friends. Our attorney advised expenses could reach $30000 and no guarantee we'll win. Or we can just leave him at home a danger to himself and others - and with the help of his friends he'll re-write his will so the girlfriend gets his money.  If you find out let me know what I can do with these friends. I know what I'd like to do with (to) them.", "date": "2009-05-27 17:58:28", "user_name": "Bigsister", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/my-mother-has-alzheimer-s-and-her-friends-do-not-believe-that-she-is-diagnosed-how-can-i-deal-with-133984.htm"},

{"post_id": "133984", "title": "My Mother has Alzheimer's and her friends do not believe that she is diagnosed, how can I deal with this?", "body": "I am a live-in caregiver to my mother. Back a few months ago I told her doctor that I thought my mother has alzheimers. Much to my surprise and disappointment her doctor said she \"didn't want to go there\". Have any of you ever heard of a doctor saying something like that concerning their patient? That just blew me away! I am convinced more than ever now that she does have it or else she has severe depression or both. She used to be real good at remembering birthdays the family's as well as other's but this month she couldn't remember the dates of her two grandchildren's birthdays. There's lots of things she doesn't remember things that a person doesn't forget just because they're \"old\". The doctor has her on citalopram for depression. She would be worse if she wasn't taking it but I keep wondering if there isn't another one that might make her be better than she is. All she wants to do is sit in her chair with her hands in her lap and stare at the TV or the floor (instead of the TV). She doesn't seem to really focus on it or really know what's happening on what she's watching. She is a very pathetic person who acts more like a zombie than a human. She has no interest in ANYTHING that I can tell. She never did have many interests except working outside or watching TV but now that she's not able to work outside she doesn't even seem interested in just going out and sitting for awhile. I'm not an outdoor person myself and not physically able to do things like that and have more than enough inside to take care of so I've hired a woman to pull weeds in the flower beds insteand of just letting them go to wrack and ruin. That doesn't seem to matter to her either. I practically had to make her go out and sit on the bench in the garden the woman was working on so she could tell her what to do. She used to like working on scrapbooks but hasn't done that lately. She is 92 years old and was never a sociable person (she tries to blame that on her parents not letting her do things when she was in high school). She couldn't care less about having company (including mine). She doesn't go to church any more since she fell. She says she doesn't go because she's not able to walk. Actually that's just an excuse because she's able to walk good enough when she needs to go to the doctors. When someone from the church calls to see about her sometimes or the woman she rode to church with comes to visit once in a while if the truth be told I think she'd rather that they didn't call or visit. A lot of old people (including me) would just love to have someone to talk with but not her. Absolutely not. All she wants to do is sit in her chair with her hands in her lap. She either can't or doesn't want to think about anything including what to tell me to get for her at the store or what to watch when her regular programs aren't on. She doesn't like bologna but fixed a sandwich out of mine one day because it was the easiest thing to put together. Even when I fix her meals for her she won't name something that would really be tasty to her she just wants whatever is the easiest. She sits in her chair in front of the TV and sometimes watches things that she isn't the least bit interested in when her regular shows aren't on rather than THINK of something to pick out of her video collection or mine (a HUGE amount) something that she might enjoy watching. But maybe NOTHING is enjoyable to her any more. Now when someone doesn't even care enough about picking something good to eat or to watch (if they like TV) and will watch or eat something they don't like rather than pick something they would like I don't need any medical training to know there is something very wrong with that person's mind. I called her doctor today and made an appointment. I couldn't get one for another couple of weeks. I am going to try to tell her AGAIN how she is acting if the doctor doesn't brush it off like she did before. If she does do any of you have any suggestions what I should do? Her doctor is my doctor too so I don't want to do anything that would make her angry towards me.", "date": "2009-05-27 14:44:13", "user_name": "ND18", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/my-mother-has-alzheimer-s-and-her-friends-do-not-believe-that-she-is-diagnosed-how-can-i-deal-with-133984.htm"},
{"post_id": "133984", "title": "My Mother has Alzheimer's and her friends do not believe that she is diagnosed, how can I deal with this?", "body": "have these friends/family go to the neurologist with you and your loved one.  They may be telling her to resist assisted living because of the aging that happens. Also many ALFs do not have great care despite the advertising. Many do. Some people thrive in ALFs most last about two years. Your mother's friends/family have their own mythologies about the care your mother may receive and are dealing with their own terror of the situation. I would talk to them about the ALFs you've found and the ALF you have chosen. Invite them to see the place.   What does \"high functioning\" mean? Is it because they see her walking therefore she does not need care? Has she been officially diagnosed?  My father was pretty physically fit but his Alzheimer's had him deeply confused. Once he started wandering into the kitchen at night to turn on the stove my mother decided she could no longer care for him. He was tall and too heavy for her to pick up if he fell. She visited him twice a day at length and advocated to the best of her ability.   My mother now has a lot of confusion due to dementia from strokes. She had put her self into an ALF but soon ran out of finances since the costs there escalate without much regulation. It was a place with an upbeat staff and residents that she had some bonding with but I still wish she had not moved in to the ALF. It was three hours away from me and so I could not possibly be there every day. After awhile she lost her will to live there. She is back in an independent living situation after intense care from me that she did not receive in the ALF. Now her living situation suits her albeit much to my sacrifice of time and attention. (She should have had this apartment then and the ALF now.) But the sacrifice has paid off in positive bonding with my mom recovery of her will and sense of humor and knowing that she is getting the care she deserves at the end of her life.   So there are two stories in one family with very different experiences around dementia and care. I would not have been able to care for my father in the way that I can care for my mother. I wish I could have.   Your mother's friends and family may have their own stories which are flag wavers for them. They are fueled by their own fears and although I'm certain they mean the best for your mother they may not have the facts straight no matter what you've told them. If you are very clear about your mother's condition and what you are able to take on if you have sought diagnosis from a good neurologist etc. and you have presented this information to her her friends and other family who persist to \"get in the way\" then invite them to take over her care. Many of the residents at my mother's ALF did well because those friends and other family members showed up and visited. People who cared about their welfare were there with extra money dinners socializing etc. The residents who did not do well had few visits and no advocates.  Even if your mother goes to an ALF assure her friends and family that she can not be left alone there for it all to work.  Good luck. None of this is easy and everyone's story is different.", "date": "2009-05-27 12:18:53", "user_name": "dahliaseason", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/my-mother-has-alzheimer-s-and-her-friends-do-not-believe-that-she-is-diagnosed-how-can-i-deal-with-133984.htm"},

{"post_id": "133984", "title": "My Mother has Alzheimer's and her friends do not believe that she is diagnosed, how can I deal with this?", "body": "get thee to a neurologist as soon as possible. it took seemingly forever for doctors to diagnose my father. eventually doctors realized his decline was obviously alzheimers but the delay in diagnosis was a delay in specific care. that was about 5 or 6 years ago. a lot has changed for the better. neurologists know much more of what to ask. they have far more studies under their belt. they can distinguish parkinsons from strokes and dementia much faster. this is critical.  for my mother she was displaying signs of alzheimers but her symptoms have had much more to do with having strokes. she has recently regained many of the skills we had thought permanently lost. she's not all better. she's not going to be 45 again or 75. but she's a hell of a lot better than she was six months ago. Her neurologist was awesome. She was on task and to the point without ever making my mother feel rushed or patronized. she was very kind about delivering tests that would tell my mom's ability to draw remember conceive etc.  But as a caregiver YOU MUST BE PRESENT. YOU MUST ADVOCATE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. This is critical. Not all doctors are awesome. (sigh.) Be sure to tell the neurologist what the condition of your loved one was a month ago and a year ago. Bring a list of all medications. If there has been a catscan recently make sure the doctor gets the results of that (it will relieve your loved one of having to endure more procedure and relieve your medical bills too.) All of the inconsistencies in behavior that everyone cited above should be mentioned to a neurologist and of course to the primary physician.   And yes the legal definitely should come first. Get power of attorney get yourself on the checking account and ahold of all finances. However many states do not cover assisted living and that will eat your finances faster than anything. Keep your loved one as independent and as social for as long as possible. Make assisted living the last resort.  If your loved one is willing adult day care is great. Look into services offered by community centers and what they offer for social activities and opportunities for seniors. This is critical.

Theres nothing in her documents. I get the impression that she may have had a baby that has died because she talks about this in her own way and then says that a girl was laughing about it. She gets very upset. She talks about lots of people within this converstaion and this is something she goes back to alot. She also lays her clothes out on her bed like she will lay a outfit out on her bed as if it is a person because she talks to it. She talks about babys lined up. Girls on one side and boys on another. She mentions girls as if these are the girls that have had the babys. I ask where she workes before and i am told she worked in a shop. She speaks of a doctor and tells me he is lovely. She also comes out of her room like in a rush to tell me its time and that i have to go in asap like someone is in labour. This may sound all confusing but I Want to try and understand her. Some people just dont think to much of it where as I do. If this hadnt really happend then why does she cry the way she does why isnt any documented. What can I say. I do talk to her and to be honest i could sit there all day and listen to her. I think she must of gone through something but carnt think what.

Then this morning she called and asked to go with me today because she has no no one to talk to (4hr drive both ways) to visit my grandbaby ( the one she screams at for singing) I polietly said nobut I wanted to scream NO WAY! anyway I digress I am getting better at not being manipulated and appearently she isn't as sick and weak as she pretended.  Also I am going to get some counseling and I'm checking on services that she is eligible for that will keep her in her own home.

I talk with her as we do things togather. I encourage all my ladys and gents to do as much for themselfs as possible to make them feel normal and to involve them in there choices and so on.

Support Group for 5 yrs. My members have told me stories similar to yours but they have learned that love and understanding can help. Take a few weeks and try to help Mom understand that others need her help - like she did for you as a child. She should feel needed and perhaps revert to her old life time. As an Alz. patient progresses in the disease their minds go back to the things they did when they were younger - so may be she will feel the need to help \"Mother\" again. Even though she isn't able to see she can hold hands sing show affection to the others surrounding her. This would be \"her Job\" and if necessary you could even say she is getting paid for it. Give the aids a $ to hand to her. It should make her feel important and needed - perhaps you can honor her in some way for doing this and even stay for awhile to show her what to do. If she is still hesitant try finding an aid to come in or friend or call Bureau of Aging ( they are able to help in MANY ways). You must have a break from this stress. Mom may not like an aid either but try explaining that YOU need some \"help\" ( not because of her ) and explain it to the aid. I realize money is always a problem - look for ways to save and contact Bureau of Aging. (I sold many family antiques to help with our bills). You must care for yourself FIRST so often care givers die from the stress of all the problems. Your Mother still loves you but very deep inside. She is no longer able to express herself and this in turn causes her great anxiety. Be loving kind hug her rub her hands or hair. If she doesn't want that at the moment - try again in 10mins. - she will forget. \"Touch\" is soooo important as it helps to sooth the patient. Keep her favorite music going in the back ground hymns perhaps. But do take care of yourself - try as hard as you can to find a Support Group. There is a wealth of information as well as sympathy in these groups. It makes a difference in your life and YOU are the important one now. Do NOT feel guilty. You are doing a wonderful job and God knows you are.. You are not alone! Go out and talk with other people they can give you so much information and those in church are helpful. I even know a minister that would \"baby sit\" for 2 hrs. every other week so the wife could attend the Support Group.  It is not an easy path but with patience you will find a way and you are doing the very best you can. Every letter you read will have good advice put them all together and hopefully life will a bit easier. God Bless You.

I have cared for my mother since January she has dementia. Friday she was taken to the emergency room as we thought she had food poisoning. Today she was much better. Alert and reading the paper to me a ritual each day. Around 5pm. Mom was sitting in her chair she called out to me I was napping on the couch next to her chair. I jumped up and saw she was grayish in color. She said she was going to get sick I grabbed the bed pan and cold rags placing them on her head and around her neck she was so weak and speech was slurred. She then fell over to the left in her chair her hands were drawn.  I can not get that vision out of my head!  As I sat with her in the emergency room I saw the reality that I am going to have to face and feel it will be not too long.  This has always been in the back of my mind with the attitude that I will be prepared. Man have I been kidding myself. The diagnosis is that she is bleeding internally. A procedure will be performed tomorrow.  So as I sit here on the couch next to her chair in my home place since 1954 I can not imagine this home without my mom here. She is a very well respected woman of our community and it's citizens. The Mayor rushed to her home when he heard the address of the call her neighbors ran to her home. She is an icon of sorts and it warms my heart to feel the true love and respect from the community in which I grew up in. I also feel a comfort of sorts as I know they will be there for me when the time comes. My mom will be 80 next month.

He will not remember even after you tell him 50x's a day. When I first started in nursing school the education and understanding was that no matter what we were to reorientate the confused person. It works better when that confusion is limited to the medical situation that can be corrected or resolves on it's own. When a person has dementia (whatever the cause) the brain does not retain that memory. Have you answered his question with the fact that she passed away in January? How did he respond to that? Since you say he asks 3x's a day I'm guessing he does not remember you telling him. Try entering his world a bit. Where would your Mother be that your Father would accept and feel comfortable with? At the store? Visiting someone? Mention that to him then immediately redirect his thoughts and actions. Perhaps something like \"Mom is at the store why don't you come help me prepare dinner.\" You know your Father best as to what would help him. Looking at old pictures or sharing memories may help or it may cause more distress. Try different senarios in small snippets if it becomes stressful then redirect him to another subject or activity. alz.org is a great website and can provide more tips on how to talk to your Dad.

Yes LOVE is an ACTION and you are doling it out by the bucket load!!! Give yourself a heafty pat-on-the-back from all of us! When a caregiver realizes that Love is an Action  (sometimes a feeling goes along) then it moves us to do the impossible. You say in your note \"I am the only one that has ever given her quality care\" (emphasis on quality). it is because you are moved by action to provide the love to your mother that she may not be able to show you. You are a mature gracious woman to be able to put aside the feelings of resentment and sorrow to do what brings you to a higher spiritual level. Giving quality care under these circumstances is truly honorable. Try not to take your mother's \"I love You\" lightly. She may not be able to \"do the love\" but the words are still valuable. It's the only way she can communicate to you how important your care for her is. She may not be able to expess that in any other way. Though she caters to your brother's she probably realizes they would not provide the care for her at all. It's her way to be accepted by them. It can be very humbling to care for the most intimate needs of another person but its not at all trivial. Be proud of the care you have chosen to give to your Mother.

This can cloud our thinking and color our reactions to our parents behavior. I agree with the comments above; she needs to be evaluated by her Dr. because of these behaviors. One of the hardest things to do as a caregiver is to step back from the situation and look at it objectively. Many times the emotions of childhood present themselves when our parents health begins to fail. Aside from dementia being a possible cause so can metabolic disorders medications etc. Have your Mom get a thorough check up. Once a diagnosis is obtained then you can begin to deal with the behavior. In the meantime try redirecting your mothers actions or comments. Bring up a different subject or different activity. Try not to respond to the comments and actions that cause you distress and frustration. If it turns out (and I'm sure some of it is) that this is the way your Mom copes with her view of her  situation (as she has probably done in the past) then I suggest that you speak to a professional about how to interact with her.

Now I've heard through my brothers that she's furious with me for \"trying to tell her how to run her life\". In addition she absolutely refuses to share her financial plans will anything should something happen to her. However that has not stopped her from taking my money. Did I mention she has assets that she refuses to sell? Did I also mention that I have a mentally-retarded brother that she has guardianship of? And another unemployed brother who lives with her that has Asberger's? I love her dearly...but I'm completely freaking out! Any advice?

Feeling guilty about feelings of resentment is a normal response and it means that you are a sensitive empthathetic person. If you didn't feel guilty about being tired of having no life then I would say you had something to worry about. Caring for aging or ill parents is a very difficult talk especially for an only child or the only child helping. Its important that you remind yourself that what you are doing is a labor of love and what you are sacrificing is tough. Try to speak with caregivers who are in a similar situation as you. If you don't know anyone reach out to a church group or try to speak to your parents doctor. Or a close friend. Or even a therapist. The important thing is to talk about how you feel. It is important to verbalize our feelings and give them validity. Hang in there. As the sole caregiver for my parents I know how you feel.

Circumstances are different for everyone. It is a fine line to define selfishness when caregiving for a parent(s). Many people that have been long time friends of my parents may feel that I am being too selfish when they look at my life and then how my parents are. But they also have not had to experience the emotional demands of Alzheimer's for one parent and severe major depression for the other parent. There is a lot of baggage that goes with that on top of a dysfunction parent-only child relationship as well.  Guilt can be dished out but only I/you can choose to accept or reject it. If you know that you have done all you can and you have to recruit help then why sweat it? If you haven't done enough in offering more care to your parent(s) is nagging at you then perhaps things need to be examined. Only you can judge this.

I don't believe in keeping people alive who have no chance at a \"normal\" life and he had a peaceful death. For those who have a parent who cannot verbalize for longer lengths of time assure them they are loved touch them as often as you can living so far away if you can you may want to make a trip or two for a few days. Unfortunately even with our technology it will be hard to communicate long distance unless someone has a laptop and web cam if you are allowed to set it up in her facility but someone will have to be on the other end that can accept your input for your mom. Thats the best I can come up with or if she has a tv you can purchase something similar thru the cable co or direct tv for a bigger picture I think this is about 100.00 a month. costly to say the least .", "date": "2009-06-25 12:01:50", "user_name": "anonymous5546", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/how-do-i-communicate-with-my-mother-who-had-a-stroke-and-is-unable-to-talk-134321.htm"},

{"post_id": "134072", "title": "Can Medicare sue me if my mom falls in our home, she has been living with us for 4+ years?", "body": "I think everyone here missed the point of the question from Tricare. They are trying to determine if they are the \"primary\" insurer or not. In this case they may not be since your mom is \"living\" there but is not the homeowner. Standard procedure for most Auto and Homeowner Insurance companies in most states is to try to transfer liability to another agency. For example if your mom fell at a neighbor's house Tricare would try to transfer responsibility to your neighbor's Homeowner Liability insurance then they would pay any expenses not covered by that policy. If you have homeowner's insurance I would check with your agent about this query. Worst case Tricare would sue your insurance company if they refused to pay. However if you do not have liability insurance Tricare is not likely to sue you unless you have deep pockets. Avoid lawyers for this kind of problem because the legal costs might be more than any wins from Tricare or your own insurance company. Also getting a lawyer at this point sends up a red flag.

The hospital refused to take him off a ventillator because the living will was too general - despite the fact that those were his wishes. You can include your Dad's feelings about such things as CPR IV Therapy feeding tubes respirators and dialysis. Yours can be more tailored based on what you might expect given his condition.  You may also want a durable power of attorney for health care which names a person (a proxy) to make medical decisions for your father should he become unable to do so.  Have Dad keep a card in his wallet stating that he has advance directives and where to find them.  Give these advance directives to your Dad's physician to be kept as part of his medical records. Also be sure to bring them to the hospital should he be admitted for any reason.  Of course power of attorney over financial matters is another necessary document.

It saves a lot of repeating and lessens the possibility of mistakes! I also make sure he has a card in his wallet with a copy of his medicines and MY contact information.

A little investigation often proves the underlying cause and stirs our compassion. There are many lonely tired and bewildered people out there just wishing someone would take the time of listen or show they care. Often all they need is a simple prayer.

The manager finally did some checking and discovered that the man was the caregiver for his wife who was terminally ill.

I emotionally physically cannot visit my Mother every day. I also have my Dad next door who should be in assisted living.  I TRY to visit my Mom 2x's a week. I don't always even manage one time. My Dad hasn't visited in 1 1/2 years.   I have hired two friends who have gone with me before to visit Mom. I know you shouldn't have to hire friends but it isn't really close and no one will go without me with them. This way they will.  They will go however often they are able; between once or twice a week to once or twice a month. I have introduced them to the staff and told them they also will be checking in on Mom. The staff has already seen them come with me before so they aren't total strangers.  My friends object to the pay part but they really need it and it is the only way I know to ENSURE that they go.   As someone else mentioned there are many CNA's and other health-care workers out of work or who have had their hours cut and are looking for side jobs. They might also be possibilities. My Dad is paying for it. I informed him; didn't ask or suggest. He's happy with it.   Believe me I know my Mom would rather see ME but it won't hurt her to have others help her and visit. I've taught them all the things I do for Mom while I'm there (lipstick hair a little Bible reading make sure she has sweatersocks and glasses on etc.)  When Dad gets on Medicare soon he won't have any money but I'll worry about that when the time comes. One thing I learned (sort of) from taking care of Mom is worry only about the present nano-second. No use worrying about the next second. Things will turn out differently than you imagine anyway. If they are both alive this second I'm happy.  I could move Mom 3 blks from me and put my Dad in an assisted living apartment at the same place but Mom receives better care where she is even though it isn't super convenient for the rest of us. Plus she has Alzheimer's and not nice to move her after 5 years unless absolutely necessary. My Dad will only go into Assisted Living if it is the same place as Mom but they don't have Assisted living where she is. It's always a puzzle isn't it?  I don't know if you could go 3 times a week and pay 1 or 2 people to go 1 or 2 other days. It makes me feel better because I get full reports each time. If it's friends they'll probably feel guilty because they should have been visiting anyway and not accept a \"gift\" for visiting. As   We have to leave a little life for ourselves. That's what our parents supposedly raised us to do(even though they've forgotten).  I'm sorry this is so long-winded. I hope something one of us says helps.

Your husband should be helping in this for sure.   Some assisted living centers offer more help than others (in the contract). But hired -in-home services provide a lot of care in many centers. Yes it costs more but it can help a lot. How much can your MIL do with provided transportation? A lot depends on what shape she is in.  The bottom line is that this is wearing you down. You need to insist that your husband brainstorm with you to find out how to best provide care without draining yourself of your own life.  It feels good to give and help and care. But for everyone there is a point when the care for one person prevents good care for another. Balance is needed and is often very hard to find. But do try.  Keep coming back.

You will know best what way would work for you. If the Dr. has already told her this then you can reiterate what the Dr. has said. If not then you could slowly introduce the understanding of dementia by reading literature about dementia and Alzheimer's. It may start a conversation where you can relate the symptoms to some of the things your Mom is experiencing. The Alzheimer's Association has literature on how to communicate with your loved ones. Contact your local chapter. They also have support groups for you and your father. The final way is to be direct and tell her she has Alzheimer's Disease explaining what it is and how she fits that discription. More than likely she will deny it and soon after forget that you told her.

One thing I will say is most of the things that Mom feels we have \"taken away\" from her are things she never liked much anyway. (like driving and cooking) I think maybe it is just that she is now more aware of things she really can't do anymore and is just now feeling the loss of that.  As far as the Mail goes...that is the highpoint of her day. She sits in the front room doing her crossword puzzles and watching tv waiting for the mailman to come. At this point there is no way we can intercept it.  Unfortunately we also just found out that Moms heart valve replacement is now failing. She may need another replacement. If she does go in for surgery I am not too sure that she will ever be able to come home again. I also think that maybe that is why we have not yet been given any medication for her for the Alzheimers yet. The Doc had been going to do that on out last visit...but then he got the echocardiogram results and I assume prioritized her heart over the alzheimers. I am not sure if the medication would be considered incompatable because of that. Either way it means we are still dealing with her without any medication.

{"post_id": "134589", "title": "Any advice on how (or if) to tell a parent that they have alzhiemers?", "body": "Dear LoriLocks; Try to imagine yourself for a moment being in a situation that is fairly unfamiliar where you are being expected to participate in but are not sure what to do. Perhaps a situation at work or home or in a volunteer group. Then you plan that activity and begin to accomplish the task and someone comes up to you and takes that project away. With or without explaination. I would imagine it would be upsetting. Now your cognitive ability is not compromised so you may persue the task with the other person and resolve the conflict. Your Mom may be feeling this way but can not resolve the conflict she can only feel that it has been \"taken away.\" That does not mean you were wrong in your decision but sometimes when we put ourselves in the place of another it can help us come up with creative ways to help her resolve her conflict. The question \"Do I tell her she has Alzheimer's?\" may be a moot point. She is already aware that something is not right in the way people interact with her. She just doesn't understand why because she is not aware cognitively of the problem. Does that make any sense? Perhaps compromise and creative solutions may help ease the tension. Mind if I address each comment with a suggestion that might spark an answer that suits you and your family. The Mail: perhaps intercepting certain letters before she reads them. Have items/letters/magazines that would be of interest to her that makes a positive interaction for her. Shopping: Some store now have the scooters that people can drive or have a wheel chair (Walgreens CVS Sam's club have simple wheelchairs that are reasonable in price). Decorate it call it her queen chair (or something more creative) emphasis the positive aspects or make it something very special. Cooking: What can she do that is safe and a part of the action? Again be positive and special in presenting the task. It's important to not trivialize the action. If she really does not want to do it then she will soon tire of the task and stop. That way it will be her choice not your \"stopping\" her. The hardest thing to relate to is the fact that her cognitive problem does not allow her to understand why she is being treated like this. It would be like you being told you can't do something you have done all your life but your perspective is \"Yes I can\". Have fun being creative if one thing does not work try another. Then when you have it all figured out......that idea will no longer work and the creative juices will have to flow again. Good creativity to you!!

She lives on her own but is suffering from dementia.", "body": "Let's see if I can rememmber all the ideas that floated through my head.  1. Re colonoscopy. Why at 90 plus? I just had my last one at age 81. Next was due in 5 years and what if they found a polop? Takes 5 or 10 years to grow. Will I be alive then? Checked with the doctor. He kind of started. I could see him check my age do the math and agree with me.  2. Driving. please Call the State police or licensing agency. They will call her in. Some places there are agencies who will do the evaluation. Have you watched the HBO tapes on Alzheimer's? Find them on line either through HBO or Alzheimer's sites. Do you want to feel responsible for her killinng or seriously injuring another person?  3. Aricept. Sound have been started years ago. Find out at her stage what exactly is it expected to accomplish. Then yes if you judge it's needed. It's a very tiny pill easy to call whatever and get her to take it. Watch for side effects. Diarrhea is one that got me. A lactose free diet with acidopholous in the morning and yogurt with evening meds has eliminated the problem. I also had insomnia but another med I was given for something else took care of that. There are some natural remedies at the health food store. Check with her doctor first.  4. Assisted Living. There are some wonderful ones and they do allow her to take a roomful of her things. The socialization physical and mental stimulation that should be available are very important components of a good regime. Will it provide a Meditterean diet? Another important component.  Since any move will be traumatic at her stage you might want to find a facility where you are moving. Any other sibs beside your brother or close relatives involved? Can you conference with or without a mediating soical worker and come to some decisions.  5. Combativenss. yes meds can help. Have you read The 36 Hour Day? It has so many helpful hints on that subject.  6. Unless your mom has been declared incompetent I don't think you can force her to do anyything. Has she given her Medical or Legal Power of Attorney to any one? I did that when I was first diagnosed. It hasn't been needed but it's in place for when ever it's needed.  Good luck. You dod not face an easy task. Try the Alzheimer's Assoc.

I mean we can't investigate go to their house or listen in on their conversations...and outsiders don't really know the whole story. You know them better than anyone. What do your siblings say? Their Physician?   In my family Mom told me one day that Dad has Alzheimer's. That was about the extent of the conversation. My sister told me to read books on the subject. It took a while before I did seeing no immediate need. We thought Dad was a bit quirky and Mom mean irrational and same-o-same o.   Then Mom started calling more often saying \"Dad is threatening to hit me.\" Or \"He's breaking things...\" And when I'd visit sure enough Dad was threatening and yelling and slamming doors more. But I also found that she was hitting him~while driving! And screaming at him while driving. Lots of crazy things were happening and so I had to act. In fact the craziness got worse until Dad finally had to be institutionalized. He's doing much better now and is in a great nursing home and his needs are adequately cared for.   Point being maybe there really is abuse going on. It's entirely possible. But you can't magically make it go away and we can't really help being outsiders and not really knowing the whole story. They probably won't get better on their own. It usually doesn't work that way and there's no answers that will change it unless your Mom or Dad have help and intervention. And there's lots of avenues for that. Check with Senior Services in your area and follow their recommendations or with their Physician. I went to their church's care support personnel who had seen some problems and suggested some resources. That's what you need too.

A strange confusing disorder. Know what the site says about NPD? It says to cater to their every whim or walk away. You have chosen to walk away. And you're not \"bad\" for doing so.   Another characteristic of those with NPD is to make their targeted person feel like they did something wrong or are lacking in some way and to feel really bad about themselves. Kind of like mirroring what the NPD secretly feels but hides behind false superiority. Childishness or dependency and irresponsibility and laziness are common too. And you are right on target with the attention seeking observation. It's classic NPD.   Other characteristics include not caring for any but themselves lacking empathy and not even caring for their own bodies. I'm just a daughter and dealing with a very sick-minded emotionally abusive mother so I don't pretend to be able to diagnose yours. But you're describing what I know well. You may want to research this for yourself.   The sibling issues are an entirely different story altogether. They too have been affected by your mom and have chosen to walk as well. (Not necessary abandon you so much as preserve themselves.)   NPD is a mental illness to be sure and often goes along with physical ones even causing them at times if I'm correctly interpreting the research.   You are a good daughter and a dear brave soul! It is a difficult road and will probably get much worse (for your mom). But there is hope for you. Though you may feel alone you're not entirely. There are many people here on this site and others who understand empathize and can be supportive to you. And as you become stronger in dealing with your mom's condition some issues with your siblings may resolve themselves as well.   If your Mom is not a danger to herself then you're not neglecting her by walking away. That is a healthy response. I always feel better with distance. But if she needs help rather than \"turn her in\" find someone who can help her. A social worker can provide you with resources and direction that will help both of you. It's important that you also take care of you both emotionally and physically.   Believe me your observations are real correct and you can trust your instincts.

I am the only daughter and the oldest of 3 children. I also live @200 miles away from my widowed mother. My 2 brothers live very near my Mom. In May Mom (80) lost control of her walker and fell. It is true the 'fall' starts everything. Up until this time she was living alone in her home by brothers taking care of all mainteneance and helping with daily tasks. She spent @ a week in the hospital- no broken bones- just agitation of arthritus. We placed her is a rehab facility for @ 5 weeks where she received daily therapy. All she wanted to do is to go home she hated it at the facility. We were talking about the next plan whoich could have been going to her home with 24/7 livein help assisted living coming to stay with me 200 miles away staying at the rehab/nursing. What she so boldly suggested was for me to come and live with her at her home! She said that If I did this she could stay in her home. It didn't matter to her at all that I work and have a family 200 mmiles away. When I told her I couldn't do what she wanted- she told me we were done and hung up on me. She didn'ty expect my brothers to move in she told me because I was a women and she was my mother- this is what I should do.  We have managed to get passed the issue- she is in the assisted living now. I do know though that she is still very annoyed with me; I don't have much worth in her eyes. It doesn't matter that I have been 100% mentally involved fovever because I don't live nearby- I'm not worth much to her.", "date": "2009-07-16 14:27:58", "user_name": "caregivership", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/elder-started-to-throw-things-from-across-room-134637.htm"},

So stop beating yourself up. You have family responsibilities and she knows that. You have done what you can and sometimes we can't please everyone all the time. The choice you made is the one you had to make. She will be fine in due time. She is just in her own world .  My mother lives with me and she is a NPD person. For the time being to relieve my stress I stopped asking her to be a part of the family months ago. She is happy staying in her room like a teen ager watching tv eating candy reading the enquirer and globe playing solitare coloring and whatever else she does in there and that is just fine with me I know at some point it will get worse but for now this works for both of us. She just wants a place to stay she doesn't want to be bothered with anyone else asking her to work she is lazy lazy lazy and always has been. I do not blame my siblings as in the post above they are protecting themselves as children we went thru alot. Stuff kids shouldn't have to deal with and stuff that should be basics for kids we didn't have but we survived and made better lives for ourselves. Also you will find with people who have NPD they remember things the way they want to not the way it truly was and you can't fight that. The best thing to do is forgive it and never bring it up again. Mine likes to live in the past her past its like she never was a mother its just about her and it's always been that way a long time ago I suggested she talk to someone and her doctor agreed and she flew out of his office like she had wings funny how her back didn't hurt that day until we were alone and she could move Oh boy could she move anyway I deal in reality it is what it is and I can not do anything for someone if they don't want to help themselves. So I go about my job my church life my son and my husband not necessarily in that order and life is better that way. At first I felt guilty but guilt is a useless emotion. That is the way she wants it and I am not going to do anything except make sure she has shelter warmth air conditioning food transportation to her doctors visits and shopping once or twice a month. When the situation changes than I will deal with it in the best way I can and not feel guilty. After all she has to live with decisions she has made in her life whether she remembers them or not. Good luck to you and again know you did what you could and you can't be everything to everyone. First and foremost your kids need you the most.

I already wrote a long comment but it didn't go through so I will write again. My mum has not got dimentia or Alzeimers. My mum switches her behaviour on and off when she wants to. she never does this in fron to other people which makes me beleive that she knows exactly what she is doing. She has told my Aunt she didn't mean to do it. Everytime me and my mum have days like this I feel like I am looked upon by certain family members that I just making it up and nobody believes me as she never shows them that side of her. My Aunt says she has her own probs and is sick of hearing about it. My 3 siblings do absolutely nothing. they are not round there often or long enough to help or be concerned.  My mum suffers with 3 forms of arthritis and her right hip and knee are bad and she finds it difficult to walk. S\u20ache has diabetes and is on tablets yet she is forever eating cakes and biscuits. She wears 2 digital hearing aids has spondiitis too. She goes on about people thinking that she is mad or lost her marbles and I respond to this by saying she is the only one saying that nobody else!!! I seriously hate listening to this childish behaviour as this is how I see it. She acts really childish and I say tell her she is just attention seeking. I can't help it that's how I feel. It has been going on a very long time now. It got worse when she lost her husband of 3 years who she'd been with for 6 yrs in total. I couldn't have been there for her any more than I was yt she turned on me and has been doing ever since. She doesn't do it to anyone else - she is nice and polite to them which makes me feel like she hates me. I have not seen my mum for a week now since she physically threw something at me. I don't want to be in the positon where I have to call police or social services. If I mentioned anything like that to her she would flip her lid and tell me that I am trying to say she is mad! I am walkin gon egg shells and I've told her she has got to change or I am leaving for good. I know you may think that sounds heartless but I have been helping my mum as much as possible for 7 years now with NO help and I know I can be very impatient and I have tried to change that in myself but I feel like I am the one who is bending myself and she is not even trying and she is just getting worse! None of my siblings help and everytime I have asked one of my brothers for help - he falls out with me and stops talking to me - his way of getting out of responsibilty (ignorance is bliss eh???). I dont speak to nay one of my sibling s now and feel so alone.

I am 33 years old and I am the only caregiver to my elderly deaf aunt. She is also diabetic and doesn't take to the diets I provide for her. I have been reduced to hiding food in my room and locking the door to keep her from certain foods that could be harmful to her. I have tried very hard to explain to her why it is that she can't have all the foods that other people can have. My grandmother found out that my aunt was deaf when she was very young. She then promptly removed my aunt from school. She cannot read and she cannot sign. The only way of communicating with her is for her to read your lips which she is fairly good at. The problem comes in when she decides she doesn't want to \"listen to me\" anymore she just puts her head down and refuses to look at me. She has a pet cat who I have also moved into my home even though it had made my home uncomfortable for my cats. She has since almost killed her cat because she refuses to listen to me. She feeds him anything she can get her hands on. We almost had to put him down last year because I did not have the funds for the very large vet bill that was due to her not following instructions and hiding things from me. Her bills continue to climb and climb. Every year the medications she is on become more plentiful and also more expensive. She also is becoming very poor with her personal hyigene. I have to argue with her frequently to shower. This has resulted in a few UTI's. Actually she fights with me daily about just about anything. I love my aunt dearly but the heavy load of caring for her is becoming harder and harder being that I am only one person. I have been her caregiver for 11 years and she has been living at my home for 2 years now. We have no other family that could assist us. My mother(her sister)passed on after battling cancer 8 years ago. There is no other family. Everytime I tell my story the first response is \"Don't you have any other family members who could help you?\". I can't tell you how frustrating it is. I truly HAVE NO ONE ELSE. I don't have parents siblings cousins aunts uncles...Myself and my aunt are the only family we have. I love her immensely but I just don't know how long I can keep up with this without some kind of help. I can't be with her constantly since I have to work to support us and I'm afraid I don't have enough money to pay for an outside caregiver to come to the house and help. Even if I found a good senior community for her I'm not sure I could afford it. I guess what my question is is does anyone know of where I should start in looking for some assistance?

Eleven years is a long time to fulfill caregiving responsibilities so be sure to give yourself a whole lot of credit for your enduring care of your aunt.

I think I may be right behind you as a craegiver but I have never counted the passage of time. I don't think I will. lol   You don't mention your state of residence. A good place to start your research may be your state's Attorney General's website under their consumer protection services and specifically long-term care or nursing home information. At a minimum if you call their consumer protection hotline for nursing home related issues they should be able to point you to the right local agency for your specific situation. Area Agencies on Aging across the USA though named differently in some states are a good resource.   If all else fails make an appointment with your own doctor and let your doctor know the stress you are under and ask for a referral to a local agency hospital geriatric social worker or some skilled professional who is able to steer you right. I say you need relief pronto because I agree with you. Talking to someone locally who is able to steer you right will feel like a huge burden lifted.

I would contact the agency of Elder Affairs. Depending on her age she may qualify for help through Medicaid programs for Assisted Living Facilities or skilled nursing centers. The programs I am aware of are called Divergence Program and the Waiver program. They evaluate the patient on a couple of things. Physically they would interview her and you to see were she falls in line of needing the assistance and they will also review her finances to see if she qualifies for these programs. I actually sought out an attorney to help me through this process but you can try and go directly through the programs themselves. They will also provide some direction on other things she could qualify for. Another resource to review is Medicaid on the internet. They have a list of programs outside of the two I mentioned you might want to look at depending on her situation.  Keep educating yourself. I did a lot on research on the internet and I also attended a free presentation on medicaid and medicare. That is a great place to start. I also recommend meeting with an attorney. It gave me a great piece of mind knowing someone was handling the process for me and I was doing everything legal and getting programs my mom was eligible for.

Not always easy but ultimately negative thoughts and self-talk can become a vicicious circle. Look on the bright side. If its mostly good you can always find solutions.

The only thing I would share is that placing at least one of your loved ones in a skilled nursing setting given the situation you have described will not be an act of abandonment should you decide to go that route though it may feel that way to you and/or your family. It will be an act of sanity for yourself and may ultimately save one of their lives as their total physical dependency is a recipe for in-home accidents and disasters when you are away at work and particularly when you have such a lengthy commute. A 124-mile commute is not a walk in the park. You are one person and there are only so many hours in a day.

I personally find working with my Dad (even with his Alzheimer's) much easier than caring for my Mom. Dad was always more approachable so perhaps that's the reason. However my Dad was \"removed\" from his home due to behavioral issues that made caring for him in mine impossible. The behavior was just too bizarre and also frightening. Other circumstances removed that option. But now that he's been stabilized through medications routine better nutrition and care he's better to be around. I'm been blessed with a second chance with my Dad who was previously too busy working to spend much time with. When he wasn't working or resting.   I value this second chance and count each moment as precious. He says some strange things and I just smile. Doesn't matter. He can't help it. He acts really weird at times and I let that slide too. But he can smile and laugh. He loves our visits. My whole family was there today and I invited him to walk outside in the beautiful sunshine. Instead he got distracted by a room full of people gathered and took me to a church service there. I didn't want to go but he did. So I follow his lead. Sometimes he follows mine. My time with him is usually relaxing and often fun. We laugh together. There's missing things because he's lost the ability to communicate effectively but it's OK. Things aren't perfect. But what in life is?   I told my sister that I get along better with Dad now that he has Alzheimer's than I did growing up. She scornfully pointed out about what that may say about me. It's true that he doesn't know about my daily joys and struggles or what I'm doing outside his facility. But I am no longer vying for his attention or competing with his employer wife hobbies TV etc. I have no expectations of him. Now he's \"in the moment\" with me and usually they are pretty good ones.

Explain the situation to the Dr. (or the Dr's nurse) The Dr. can contact a Home Health Agency and have a safety visit evaluation through Medicare. Has your father been to the Dr. to evaluate the reason he has fallen? Your father may need that evaluated.

Other agencies to contact would be: Area Agency on Aging Dept. of Health and Human Services Disease specific organizations.

The other problem is that she smokes. After a while my husband and I went grocery shopping. When we got back my husband noticed she was coming in from the other the porch having finished smoking. The cigarette smoke smell was very strong. We think she left the sliding glass door open to keep on eye on Mom. After she left we could still smell it.

Assets gone. in nursing home. will income allow her to get medicaid?", "body": "Cat offers some really good advice about providing documents to the State but she is slightly incorrect with some of her figures.  To qualify for Medicaid requires your MIL to meet three sets of criteria: she must have a medical need assets excluding a car and residence must be below $2000 and monthly income must be no more than $2022 (2009 limit).   Then it gets more complicated!  If any of your MIL's assets have been gifted or sold for less than fair market value since 2/7/06 her eligibility will be delayed based on a formula. If any transfers have been made see an elder law attorney in your state for guidance.   Assuming no gifts have been made the next question is whether the state is a so called \"spend down\" state or not. A \"spend down state\" determines income eligibility by first subtracting eligible medical expenses (like the cost of nursing home care) from the total income. If the balance is less than $2022 your mother in law would be income eligible.  With the cost of NH care so high if you're in a \"spend down\" State Cat is correct. All but a very small portion of her income will go to the NH to cover her costs of care. Some States only allow a $35 personal needs allowance as Cat mentions. Others provide a bit more. Texas is $60.   If you're MIL lives in a \"spend down\" state income qualification should be easy. If she lives in one of the twenty-one states that don't use the income spend down method you may need a \"Qualifying Income Trust\" to get her financially eligible. Unless your State provides a prototype you'll need to hire an attorney.  The business office managers should know if your MIL's State Medicaid program requires a \"qualified income trust\". For others reading this post a word of caution: social workers and business office managers are not necessarily experts on your State's Medicaid rules. Be very careful relying on any advice they may offer. If you have any assets to speak of have made any gifts or transfers of accounts or property or have income over the limit spend a few bucks with an experienced elder law attorney.

They should walk you through the process. Here is the generic answer  If she has no assets both currently and through your states look-back period and receives a total of $2096.00 from the VA &amp; SS then she would probably qualify if she neded skilled care. If there were no assets there would be no spend-down however she would be responsible for paying her 'share of cost' based on her income. So if the SNF monthly charges were $4096 and her income was $2096 her share of cost would be her monthly income less $35.00 spending money for a total $2041.00. In other words her checks go towards covering the costs  If she did have assets during the lookback period be prepared to document everything. A good thing to remember when you are providing documents to yours state medi-caid office is to keep 3 extra copies send everything certified and when providing copies of any bank or financial statements give them ALL the pages even if the last one is blank (so check the page numbering - pg 1 of 4 means you would send 4 consecutive pages).", "date": "2009-07-21 03:21:45", "user_name": "Cat", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/motherinlaw-monthly-income-is-1056-va-and-1040-socsec-assets-gone-in-nursing-home-will-income-134762.htm"},

My department on the aging faxed me a complete list of agencies and programs for the state.( contact the social worker from your hospital for the correct numbers to call.

Yes your mother is grieving and she needs your help. But go slowly with any big change like moving in. That will work if there is lots of room and you are respectful of each other and compatible. But there already looks like some control issues. Consider if the control issues would be better if she lived with you and sold her house?  She may be ready to sell her home and move to assisted living where she would have peers to interact with (some are excellent others not so research and check references). Or maybe paid in-home help for her would work with you just checking in on her regularly.  Living together works for some and it would be lovely if it did for everyone. But it can be very complicated. Just think it over carefully and maybe talk it over with several friends or even a counselor before deciding. Meanwhile give her all the help and support you can.

I don't know this is just my opinion. I moved my dad in with my husband children and I for 7 months and we are lucky to still be married. Like some say this can work for some and not others.

My dad is nearly deaf (and refuses to wear his hearing aids). I find myself constantly repeating myself or yelling so that he can hear me. What I have learned to do is to reduce the loudness in my voice - I will touch my dad to get his attention and then if he didn't understand me or hear me (sometimes there is no difference here) I will say it in a different way. Don't go down that road... when they are not here.... and how you will put yourself through guilt. You don't need that and she doesn't deserve or want your pity. She wants your love and respect.

Although I am a stay-at-home full-time caregiver there are many not-so-little things to ponder up to and including:  Does the person pose a direct safety threat to himself and/or to anyone in the residence including spills a pattern of falls perhaps turning the stove off and on repeatedly even if someone else is doing the meal preparation daily?  Is your home properly fitted and modified for the individual physical impairments including ease of access clear hallways etc.?  Your husband's increasing frustration with his parents is human yet also needs to be considered all around in terms of his parents quality of life and the quality of your lives as a family if he doesn't know when or how to turn that frustration switch off in short order.  Is your lack of availability and/or your husband's compromising 24/7 care and active monitoring of either of your in-laws during their hours of being up alert and/or restless?  Are you able to consistently kleep up with mealtimes that are suited to them rather than to how some of us eat and meet the consistency that they need based on ability to chew swallow and rate of digestion?  You did not mention what sorts of things your MIL is unable to relinquish control over. Is it running a household or is it possessions or something else? There is a difference if for example she is telling your husband how to run your household.  Just a few thoughts. Their doctors should be very understanding and offer you tremendous clarity in addition to what others have shared with you here. Hope things settle down for all involved soon.

I broached the subject of his selling there and moving into my house with me but he simply refuses even though me moving there will over burden my daughter financially due to child care costs for the care of my learning disabled grandson for whom I am sole caregiver while she works and also force my of age son who hasn't the salary and savings yet to move out and live on his own. By \"clump\" living we have been able to help each other out and all of us get what we need to be secure.

He wants me to sell my house desert my family here no matter what happens to them when I move. Now me living with him would sure mean an improvement for me financially because he is planning on paying all the house hold bills himself for us but I'm having trouble with leaving everyone else concerned in dire financial chaos and inconvenience. The pros of his moving here are way more than the cons. Ambulance arrival there is forty-five mins to an hour he gets around tediously and slow no family close by to help at high risk for falling and injury at home etc. I have health issues that make the ambulance arrival time a catastrophy also. If I move I can help only one....if he comes here I can continue to help everyone. His reasons for not wanting to come here are totally silly (he doesn't like my bathtub does not like using a shower as opposed baths my yard is too small and my house is in a sub-division as opposed to county etc) and I feel he is being very stubborn and grasping at straws totally ignoring the pros of it all.

It is natural to be concerned for your mom's care and to have mixed emotions. Wondering how this will impact your life her needs and yours your married life and trying to protect your mom from money grubbers are real concerns. My husband is very supportive but he doesn't handle things the same as me emotionally (thank God!). He is more objective and somewhat more detached and very stable which helps me a lot. I'm always asking him for advice. I think mothers and daughters have a much different relationship than any other and not everyone understands or shares those emotions especially our men. But they can often be more practical versus emotional.   What are your brother's expectations? If not in your mother's best interests who is making her decisions and who is in control? Does she have the finances to meet her caregiving needs? Who supports you in the caregiving besides the two men in your life? A sister aunt or a close female friend? Who else has your mom's best interests at heart?   I think what you are experiencing is something many of us share and know the difficulties involved. Perhaps the focus needs to be on what you can control which is usually not a sibling. If he's not supportive of your efforts or concerns there are plenty here who are. Hopefully you have close friends or family who are as well. Take is easy with yourself and ask your husband to help you find ways for you to get some rest support and help for you and your mom. Don't get so overtaxed that you can't be a good wife daughter caregiver etc. There are often solutions we can't see in the midst of a trial. Let your husband be the leader and help you find the answers you need. Meanwhile think of ways to be thankful such as: your mom is being cared for at the moment which gives you time for a little rest; she is just in rehab and you don't have to plan a funeral. Things could always be worse but don't look for it. Count your blessings that you're married and don't have to face this alone regardless of your mixed feelings towards your brother. And anytime you need a place to vent or someone to share the emotional burden I think you'll find that here. Will be praying for you and your mom. Be gentle with yourself and take care! Forgive and talk to a Social Worker at the rehab place to help you work through your struggles and concerns. They can offer resources and be a good sounding board as well.

In the short term I'd make sure she knows that the phone's always there for her - dealing with this kind of behaviour is easier when you have someone to talk to daily if possible.  Secondly it's a question of a family conference  I think if you can make it to your mum's. If you &amp; your sister sit down with her and explain the situation and how much it is affecting everyone it might help. Since she won't accept assisted living try out other ideas with her - at the very least a home help once a day if possible who can prepare and give lunch do some cleaning and and help her bath. That way she gets one good meal and her normal standards back.   Your mum needs to see that it is no good leaning on your sister like this as eventually your sister will break and then what? Joining a support group might help too.

That feeling is difficult to know what to do with when the elder isn't cooperating. The important thing to remember is that judgement and safety awareness is often impaired with dementia and therefore the elder isn't always competent to make health related decision on her own behalf. Engage the assistance of her MD. Also be aware that neighbors may at some point become concerned and notify whatever elder protective services there are in your local area. If you don't intervene choices can easily become more limited yours and hers. Protective services once notified will do everything to assure her safety. Your intervention may include more quality of life considerations in the decision making process. You may need to seek an appointment as her health care proxy and durable power of attorney. Her MD can invoke those two documents essentially naming you as the decision maker. Ultimately the court can be petitioned for guardianship. This is more expensive and can often lead to hard feelings among family members. Tough love is hard with our kids.

He has a good deal of ability/mobility but he does have brain damage that seems worse some days than others. He has for the size of his stroke very good mobility but there are slight impairments. He does drive what scares me with that is I have seen him on an off day and there are just days he does not need to drive and days he does ok. My biggest challenge is his complete resistance to certain aspects of my involvement. He doesn't mind \"help\" to a degree my mother waited on him hand and foot. He doesn't want my help with managing money bills prescriptions insist on driving everywhere vs. using the phone. I worry about some of the places he drives and the areas but if I try to talk to him about something like that he immediately just starts yelling that he is not going to be bossed around. I worry about the fact that he is a prime target for a mugging or similar and he just doesn't accept that. Also the minute he loses something forgets something or has any kind of problem whatsoever it is totally my fault EVERY time no matter how ridiculous. The last several days he has become very very verbally abusive. While I live with him he does not require 24/7 care thank goodness. I have a fairly demanding full-time job but they are flexible. If I am not home when he wants/needs something he will hurt his back doing it himself and carry on the rest of the evening about his back. EVERY time it's something that could have waited a few hours. He is giving me an extremely hard time about work which I am mid-managment salaried professional position. I don't work 8-5 and sometimes I have to work a weekend here and there. BUT if there is something urgent I can have flexibility and be there right away. Right now he constantly finds a reason to be angry because of something he wants or needs done while I am gone. I really need to keep my job I'm single this is a good job with a good career path and he doesn't need 24/7 care right now which is a good thing. I guess I'm concerned about the lack of real authority or ability to make some important decisions if it comes down to it. And I know I cannot stress wise handle a home environment where there is yelling and verbal abuse constantly I just can't. But I am the only one that can.

My first one was just awful The second one was better and the third is wonderful.    Go local.  Try to find an agency that has an office in your town or one near you.  Be very specific in your needs. We needed someone who did not have small children. Did not want her to bring in colds flu or take days off for school calendar or child illnesses.  Also we wanted someone who spoke with little or no accent since mom is hard of hearing.  If you are paying them you call the shots!! Make a list of what you expect to be done during the day. One woman told my friend who has her 99 year old mom with her that she did laundry only once a week. She is now doing it everyday as per my friend telling her what her job is. Some people will get away with what you let them.  Make sure the agency has a list of your needs and concerns.   Check prices. I found a wide range of prices even within the same company but in different counties.  I try to keep a very worker employer relationship with my help but it does not always work. You really come to think of many of these wonderful woman as family. My best helper is 72 and comes 4 hours a day three days a week and we think of her as family( loves my dog too). Have more than one person- you need a backup if someone can't come. Using an agency is less paperwork for you but I also have a private hire who comes on Saturdays. She has been coming for 3 1/2 years and she is now such a dear friend. If you don't want to go to an agency then call your church or hang up notices in public places.

There is so much to learn and it can be a long long road. Local libraries carry lots of books on this subject and your local Alzheimer's Association as well. Though it is different for everyone.

Count the costs then count them again. Get wise counsel before you move him anywhere. What does he say? It's a terrifying scenario for some.

I've had to put a waterproof pad down on the chair she sits in every day because some mornings I find her bare-butted there instead of in her bed. Sometimes she can't even make it to the b/r toilet in time and goes on the b/r floor. Then not only do I do the laundry then the b/r floor needs cleaned up. She won't drink much water during the day except to take her pills with so I have to give her additional water to keep her skin from getting sunken in. We have tried limiting the fluid intake after 6 pm but that doesn't seem to help. I still have to do laundry every day practically. I even have waterproof pads from the hospital and a zippered waterproof mattress pad still doesn't help.", "date": "2009-09-07 08:21:35", "user_name": "lach61", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/questions/anyone-can-suggest-a-home-remedy-for-senior-adult-bedwetting-she-is-a-diabetic-too-but-blood-135585.htm"},

We all must try hard not to treat our parents like children. I believe that deeply and I feel many elders act out when they feel they are treated that way. That's why I don't like terms like \"parenting our parents\" even though it often seems like that is what we do. This \u201cself-talk\u201d can send us into \u201ccrazy making behavior.\u201d So it\u2019s good that was brought up.  But - and many of you have made this wonderfully clear - many people were raised by abusive addicted parents and this has made the complicated caregiving relationship even harder. All caregivers who are doing what they feel is best for their care receivers are heroes but to me those of you who are doing the best you can with such difficult backgrounds are amazing beyond belief. Many people under those circumstances can't do it all and have to turn their parents over to a court appointed guardian. That is okay too. If they can't handle it it's understandable.  But you who are doing what you are under such difficult conditions are exceptional. You won't be perfect as none of us do this perfectly. But you are something special.  When I think back on all seven of my elders there are many things I'd do better. But there are many things I'd do better if I could go back as a mother. Yet for everyone I've cared for - elders and children - I did the best I could at the time. That's what you all are doing.

I was a bit put off by this thread at first a feeling somewhat defensive. (Guess that's from growing up under very negative circumstances.)

As part time helper of my mother (my father has dementia and Parkinsons) I've been trying my best not to fall into the role of bossy older daughter with her. It may be too late for my father but I recognise the risk of driving my bright capable mother into infantilism by taking control or into craziness by denying who I am and just taking orders. It's been quite hard to walk the line I'm sorry to say. I suppose because I am affected by the situation too and have my own issues.   Still it's hard to step back into a parental relationship when it's been toxic in the past. It's hard to let the past go in fact. I was talking to someone whose mother had always been an unpleasant drunk but whose dementia has made her forget she likes alchohol. She has turned into a sweet and charming old lady but some of the family understandably find this change very hard to handle.  Perhaps that's what dementia sometimes allows: a wiping of the slate.   Anyway apart from organic causes I sometimes think that if I was my father and had been struggling with Parkinson's and depression in front of the television for 20 years I'd be rolling around on floors and peeing into laundry baskets too by now.  Otehrwise I know people of people who've had dementia and been happy about it. My friend's great aunt used to wake in her care home every morning convinced that she had just checked into the Ritz.

By creating a care contract you are assuring Medicaid that this is a legitimate payment coming from your parent's account and it will not create a problem when they \"look back\".  It is true that parents are allowed to gift their children $12000 per year but that only applies to income tax not Medicaid. Medicaid will count that as a non legitimate expense and your elder parent may not qualify for Medicaid until that $12000 is repaid.   The money received from your parent MUST be declared but there are usually enough deductions to off-set the increase in income. Keep track of all miles incurred when taking your parent to appointments etc. Keep track of the amount of space that they are utilizing in your home etc.  In reality you are saving your parent money by caring for her and as long as you are putting forth your best effort in caring for her then you must realize that it is your right not to suffer in doing so.

If you are concerned that your death may bring a heavy financial burden on your family so you want something to cover final expenses (sorry to be so blunt but you asked the question) there are better ways to prepare than buying life insurance. First make sure you have obtained any Government assistance for which you qualify.

I am not an expert but I know there are many helpful programs out there and you need to find them. Your main goal here is to keep your \"Living Expenses\" as low as possible because these days it costs a lot more to live than to die. And you want to live--even if only to beat the odds! As for \"Final Expenses\" I would talk with a reputable Funeral Director in your area. Death and Burial are their areas of expertise and if you are willing to do some advanced planning they can ensure a decent burial with a price tag that won't put your family in bondage for the rest of their lives.

If crisis hits and no one has addressed the subject of what our parents want it can be enormously stressful for everyone involved and some of that stress can be avoided by simply planning ahead. how to bring the subject up depends somewhat on your relationship with your mom... It often helps to bring up changes in health or living arrangements of a friend or a neighbor and ask her what she'd like to do in a similar situation. It gets her to start thinking about the fact that this might happen.. and also tell her that u are not telling her what to do u just want to know how can you and her work together to make sure her wishes are met.

Number 1 is that you are attempting to communicate about the future now while your mom's health is not at a crisis point. That's great. Number 2 is that your mom is non-confrontational; you know her style and you'll be able to use that knowledge as you talk with her. And number 3 is that she is still in good health physically and mentally although you mention \"borderline depression\". Perhaps her doctor could help her to understand that treatment for depression is available. Knowing those strengths you are in a position to KEEP TALKING with her! You have planted the seeds for future communication about wills. You will also need to talk about \"health care power of attorney\" and \"living wills\" as well as financial matters in general: all touchy subjects. Coming from a position of love and concern continue to bring up the difficult topics but also have the less emotional ones as well. Perhaps one time you could talk about how to help her stay active and/or social. Maybe there is something that she could do that would be similar to gambling without the cost.

If she can do more for herself it would be great to allow her to do so and not enable her excessive reliance on you if that is the case. Consider asking her to help you set the table in advance of a meal for example or sort and fold clothes after they are taken out of the dryer. Anything light that does not require major physical maneuvers in another room of your home may be a start if she is physically able to do so without posing any safety threat to herself or others in the home.  Consider inviting your husband to take a walk with you only in your neighborhood at day's end and let your Mom know that you are both going on a walking date each night as one way of being able to talk to each other privately. Is your Mother's memory ok or does she have any cognitive issues? Does she have any hobbies? Any grandchildren who might come visit and entertain her for a bit for an hour or so on a weekend even? Can she help you make a few hand-made Christmas gifts even if you don't give them away? Simple crafts could become a little hobby for her if she has the cognitive and motor coordination skills to accomplish. She can even make personalized Christmas cards or holiday greeting cards for others or dried floral arrangements for Thanksgiving. Sounds like she may be bored? Perhaps without realizing it even you may be enabling her interruptions by not creating sufficient structure or routines to help her realize that there is a need for balance in how you and your husband spend time with her and with each other. Just taking a shot at this as your post doesn't give enough background to determine whether there are physical or cognitive issues nor clues about how she goes about interrupting your conversations with your husband.

In the case of my parents I consulted with free legal services (available for seniors in our county) and they directed my steps. I also talked with several lawyers (at no charge) through my parent's senior center. They can direct you as well. That's where the one told me I could do it without paying an attorney to do it. I am ever-grateful to him and if I ever did need one I would choose him!   Gvergrl you're dealing with a lot with all your circumstances. You may not be able to protect the assets from one for the other without assistance and wise counsel. You can't be sued unless you do something wrong.

You would be responsible for quarterly reports audits filings with IRS etc. You will undergo an annual review and the court may determine that your status as a conservator is provisional - or limited.

This doesn't cover their finances.   What you need to do is go to the Court to file a $20.00 Petition for Appointment of Conservator or Protective Order. You can check the box: \"the adult has property that will be wasted or dissipated unless proper management is provided.\" But you need a reason such as: \"The individual is an adult unable to manage his/her property and business affairs effectively due to: (again boxes) mental illness mental deficiency physical illness or disability chronic use of drugs etc.\" This probably needs to be backed up by a Physician's statement of incapacity etc.   I requested an immediate Protective Order pending the regular hearingbecause: their estate was in \"imminent risk of dissipation and vulnerability...\"   I was told (by an attorney) that I do not need a lawyer to file this petition. That will cost you much more to pay him/her to do the paperwork for you and you still have to get the financial records etc. Attorneys can charge $220.00 an hour or more to do what you can do yourself.

I knew about independentliving.com but I will check out alzstore.com. I'm a family medicine doc. My parents are in their late 70's &amp; doing ok so far. But every day I see patients with dementia and patients who care for their loved ones with dementia. I'm working with a local inventor to see if we can create/ fill a need in our community regarding what caregivers or patients with dementia need.

Helping is one thing but the demands upon your time attention and willingness to help are an infringement upon your good intentions. It would be wise to step back (or out) as you have obligations to your own family. Take a breather get some wise counsel and set some 'healthy' boundaries. She sounds scared and very manipulative. Don't mean to sound harsh about your \"friend\" but she is taking advantage of your good graces. What about your own family? Do they resent your absence? Baby steps probably need to lead to bigger ones and very soon! How about a giant one out for a breather and some time for you to reflect about what's really going on here. Since Hospice is involved let them know you need a break and tell your friend the same. Time away may help you both clarify things. Prayer helps.
