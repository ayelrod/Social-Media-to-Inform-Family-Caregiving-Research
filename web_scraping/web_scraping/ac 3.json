{"post_id": "474037", "title": "Medicare keeps taking money from my social security check.", "body": "On 8/28/2017 I was bitten by a neighbor's dog. The bite didn\u2019t require stitches so I went to my doctor on 8/29 to just get it checked out. That was the only visit and treatment I ever received for the dog bite. Since I had Medicare that was who the doctor's office charged for the visit. My daughter had a lawyer on retainer and suggested I file a claim. The lawyer was able to get a judgement for me and retained $235.00 for Medicare. The money sat in the account for several years. I called and asked had it been taken care of and was told after several calls that they would call me when things were settled. Fast forward I start receiving threatening letters from Medicare saying I owe them over $3000.00. With an attachment of over 20 pages of charges they said are related to the dog bite. The charges included knee surgery visits to a Dr. I see monthly and had been seeing since before the dog bite. I call my lawyer and leave a message that it\u2019s been way over 3 years since this happened and he needs to get his behind in gear and take care of this. His reply was a letter saying that he was no longer my attorney and that he took my suggestion as a threat and was going to call the sheriff on me. He still has the $235.00 in addition to the percentage he collected. Then Medicare comes for me telling me that I owe this $3000+ and they are going to be taking 15% of my social security check and charging interest as well. I called TOP Coast Professionals (who make the debt calls) and told them that there was ONLY 1 visit related to the bite. She told me I could send a copy of the billing for the bite and they could get the record adjusted. I got that called to say I was sending it she then said that I would also have to get letters from all the other 70+ service providers saying they hadn\u2019t treated me for the dog bite. I spoke with a gentleman named Ken at another number I called who agreed with me saying that my real financial liability was only $90.00. He was at NGHP. But that I would have to talk to Coast Professionals. He said I should get my money back but he couldn\u2019t say when that might be. I don\u2019t know the motivation of the person making out the report for me that day. They had the ICD codes they knew what was what. But here I sit having sold my jewelry just trying to pay my bills. I don\u2019t have much left to sell my wedding ring and engagement ring are gone. I have a few gold chains left. I\u2019m afraid to pawn my car. I couldn\u2019t pay it back and I\u2019d lose my car too. I don\u2019t know if you can help me but maybe the people who are reading this will be forewarned to just pay the bill don\u2019t wait for Medicare to call one day. The biggest thing in all of this is why that person at Medicare put together a recovery summary they knew was wrong and I\u2019m afraid of when the bills come and I don\u2019t have anything left to sell.", "date": "2022-04-02 20:34:34", "user_name": "Toodistressed", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Financial Planning", "Medicare", "Paying for Care"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/medicare-keeps-taking-money-from-my-social-security-check-474037.htm"},

Does she have too much money to qualify for Medicaid? If so SHE should be spending down HER own money to private pay rather than you!

People are not let go because their care is costly and unpleasant and family doesn't get a vote in when it is time for the person \"to go\". Only the patient can decide when it is time and the patient must first go through psychological testing to be certain that the person understands what he is asking and that this is what the person wants. Dignitas which is the one often used (about 10000.00 for the entire process) demands that you have thorough paperwork and interviewing that this is your wish. The one difference between there and here is that you don't need the \"6 months and you will be dead\" rule nor do you need to have a diagnosis of a life-taking disease. You can merely be OLD and request this. Or you can be facing down a diagnosis of dementia and ask for this. But you cannot HAVE dementia to the extent you are no longer mentally competent.  I agree with you that I wish we had a \"Dignitas\" here. As an old retired RN I very MUCH wish it were here. You should not be paying for your elder's care. What will happen when that money you are spending is not there for your own age? Who will pay? Just listening to how many veterinarians take their own lives on an NPR program the other day; animal care is so difficult and so heartbreaking. But the thing they feel most enables them is the readily available medications to do it. One in six vets they say will eventually relieve themselves of their own lives with their own medications. This indicates there may well be many out there who would be willing now to exit this life.  I think that law will loosen in our own country when in future given our current birth rate we have many more seniors \"living too long\" who have no one to care for them and the \"system\" cannot sustain the cost of ongoing care that doesn't help but merely keeps alive the living husk of a being who is suffering and ready to go.

My brother wasn\u2019t on board then\u2026..but he is now!   She was driving on a beautiful day up the main road to our home (the road is wide and only a few curves). My Mom literally drove off the road for no reason (to this day can\u2019t explain why) into a five foot deep gully. She proceeded to go headfirst into a telephone poll knocking down the wires for over 300 feet. The poll went across the road and thankfully no other cars or people were involved. Thankfully she had her Jitterbug on her and a woman driving by was able to find the emergency number and call me and 911!   In the end Mom was fine other than bruised ribs and ego. My brother and I made the decision to have her cease all driving. The condition was that in order for her to continue living with me she would have to agree to give up driving. She reluctantly agreed. She still complained she can\u2019t drive and even after her Alz diagnosis\u2026.still states she\u2019s fine and has no memory issues. Sometimes tough love needs to happen. You absolutely did the right thing reporting her to the DMV! You can also get a doctor\u2019s note too to recommend the driving cease. I\u2019m not sure if her doctor will do that for you\u2026.

You are the only one you can change. I found I had to increase emotional and physical distance to decrease the harm to me. Less contact stronger boundaries maintaining the consequences of breached boundaries.   It's very difficult for a person who has been abused in any way as a child to caregive the abuser(s).

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "This is not so much a question but more of a rant.In the last couple of years I have found myself fending off requests of assistance to assist with an elderly parent. Requests for money. Requests for time. Requests for care assistance.For the most part I have fended them off. But I do what I am comfortable with and that is all. I am often judged by others for this. Aunts Uncles family friends. But those others do not know what I have been through and were never there to assist me when I needed it. So I don't care. Their opinions are irrelevant. They mean nothing to me and I never have anything to do with them anyways. Aunty or Uncle status means nothing. They are basically strangers. Every source of support in my life has always come from outside of the bloodlines.Now in my 30s I have been the victim of neglect and abuse as a child and have never had any support in my life from my family. Neither emotional nor financial. So why should I drop anything now just because the remaining parent is old and infirm? I am not grateful for what has been done to me. I have always had to do everything for myself and fend for myself.I do feel bad for the remaining parent and I do not want them to suffer. But I also don't want my life dragged down by it and I wont let that happen. I am just going to do as much as I am happy to do and that is all.What tops it off and makes me even more angry is the parent arranged for all inheritance to go the step parent. I know it sounds entitled of me to complain about this but I don't care. After their gross lack as a parent the least they could have done for me is leave some kind of legacy rather than give it all to a step-parent who was part of the abuse and who I utterly despise. Part of that money also includes money left from the parent who I did love who passed a long long time ago and from two sets of grandparents. And they can't even leave me a cent. And yet there still is an expectation for me to be there at the beck and call and drop everything after all of this and they cannot even do that.Children of abusive parents - do not let yourself be pressured by others who know nothing of your circumstances into over -extending yourself to look after them when they are old. Stuff them. If they were never there to help you when you were vulnerable and needed support they are IRRELEVANT.Parents - be careful of how you treat your children because you reap what you sew. And if you abuse your children they will not look after you when you are old.

Kids survive those things and in fact do better if their environment is not sterile. Daily vacuuming should be quite enough! Poor kids if their parents subject them to this kind of scrutiny  Mother had vascular dementia and was really off the wall beyond her \"normal\" BPD. Nancy's sister needs a neuropsych assessment IMO and then appropriate meds to calm her down. That's the only thing that worked for mother. She was paranoid and having psychotic episodes. The antipsychotic helped her a great deal. She also needed an antidepressant. Mother was looked after by a geriatric psychiatrist who was the only one who seemed to know what to do - assessments and meds. It's very important to get the right professionals involved. At one point I stopped taking phone calls (let them go to voicemail) from her as they were so hurtful and just plain crazy. The months before she got assessed and treated were pretty tough as you may remember me posting here.

Reasonable would be great for me. I have a very difficult sibling too and had a very difficult mother that I was POA and executrix for. I had to let my sibs nasty comments roll off my back. Wondering why they were like this was a waste of time and energy for me. It is what it is. After mother died and the estate was settled I cut contact with my sib. It was the right move for me. I'm not saying any of this was easy. It wasn't but I learned to deal with it.   glad -happy for you that the job is going so well so far. I read your other posts about your AirBnB. Yikes!!! I think you have gone the right route reporting them. Hopefully some positive changes will be made. It must have been nice being home in your own bed for a little time.   sharyn - not nice that Nancy is very ill and also has an abusive sibling. Nancy has to put herself first and let others deal with her sister. That may mean having little contact. Nancy sounds like she was a lovely friend to your mother. I am sorry she is facing this. You say you are feeling low and down on yourself. Please give yourself a pat on the back for being a great help to your mother when she was going through dementia and also for being a great grandma to your grand-twins and a great mother to your children. Do something good for you -something that will pep you up. Hope senior kitty is still doing well.  I'm still working on treatments for the CFS. I definitely need more energy. MCT oil (bullet proof coffee) seems to help. It's early to say that this is reliable in an ongoing sense but every bit helps!!!  Since mother passing and cutting contact with sis my mind's peace has increased. It's over three years since mother passed and about 9 months since I cut contact with sis. There s no doubt that my quality of life has improved despite other difficult things that have arisen. My dd is recovering from her second chemo and doing well. The next one will see her half way through the chemo. She's not worried about the surgery at all which is good. After that comes the radiation.  Waiting for lawyers to contact me about sending money for the condo purchase. I won't feel it is mine until money has changed hands. Possession date is April 8th!

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "LilyBear I can relate to so much of your story! I was also the only D and my parents ended up settling in my city 10 mins away. After my father died my mother slowly started failing but it didn't get bad until she stopped driving at age 90 in 2016. I became her chauffeur and she didn't like it when I placed boundaries about that.   One good thing that I did was to send my 3 brothers an email when I'd been with my mother telling them what I did how she was and how long it took. This was smart on my part since they would otherwise have had no idea how time-consuming she'd become for me.   My 3 brothers are out of state and it took quite a while before they started seeing what I was seeing as she could showtime. Eventually a gall bladder infection landed her in the hospital for 17 days then rehab then LTC in the NH where she finished rehab. Previously to this hospitalization she lived \"independently\" in a condo with the only help being a cleaner once a month (she was fastidiously neat and tidy). She refused to hire help with bathing which she needed. I didn't offer to help and don't know if she would have even allowed it. She sure accepted my help when I stayed with her for 8 long days and nights with some kind of muscle ache a few years prior. She became nearly helpless at that time.   She threatened to cut me out of the trust. She did cut me and one of my brothers out of being POA so that left 2 brothers with joint POA (each could act independently). (One of these brothers took her to the attorney on one of his rare visits -- he later claimed he had no idea what she did at that visit.) At this point she was in the hospital about to transition to rehab. My mental health was being affected and I told the main POA brother that I needed compensation if I was to continue on in my role. He readily agreed and agreed to compensate me with back pay also. (I'd brought up the issue of compensation with my mother previously and she'd gotten indignant and disgusted telling me \"You don't pay family!\")   Just as well that I wasn't POA -- now the POA could pay me $20/hour. (The POA couldn't pay themselves.) No taxes taken out I simply sent my brother an accounting of my hours and he paid from that. My mother would never qualify for Medicaid. Things got better from that point on because I considered it just a job. I had threatened that since I wasn't POA that one of my 2 POA brothers could move her to be near them.   My mother had made it clear (no filters) that I'd always been a disappointment to her was a nasty person was trying to cheat her out of her money etc. She even wrote a disjointed note at the NH to tell one of my brothers (got the name wrong) at the wrong address (was kind of HER brother's address). The staff thought it was quite amusing.

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "I wish I had been able to access your letter 20 years ago! In a nutshell both of my parents were toxic. My mother was cold and emotionally distant and my father was a malignant narcissist. When they were still young and healthy they moved near me and my family. My kids were able to develop a relationship with them because they were good to my children. Good grandparents. Poor parents.  It started slowly. They needed help for this or that we didn't think anything of helping them out. I did not sign on to become their main caregiver. I have three other siblings who lived too far away to help. Mom started having real issues along with severe dementia and my father refused to place her. He would take care of her and when I came over once a week I'd spell him. I didn't want to have to bathe her change her poopy pants take her pills or try to appease whatever delusions she had. And he wasn't capable of taking care of her. Eventually he realized she had to be placed it was more than he could handle.   She died and he fell apart. I had to have him hospitalized three times that year and every time he was angry with me. How dare I take him to the emergency room because I thought he was septic? This brilliant man also developed dementia. He started accusing me of stealing his money. I wasn't stealing his money I was paying his bills because he had refused to sign a POA. Was I supposed to let his lights go out? Not have TV? I accessed his bank account with his permission and paid everything online. With his paranoia he told my brother I was doing \"nefarious things\" at the bank and taking his money. So my brother called the bank believing him rather than discussing the situation with me. DCF was called and when I realized what had happened I called my siblings and told them I quit and one of them was going to have to step in.  They were horrified. Take care of him? But he's so mean and difficult! So for the first time the family got together and made a plan to help me take care of him. But they weren't there for the day-to-day abuse. It just kept getting worse. It was my fault he was old. My fault he was fragile. My fault he was blind. He'd go into rages at me often because I wasn't helping him enough with his laptop. Can you imagine trying to teach someone how to work a laptop when they're blind? He couldn't even remember how to turn it on!!  I had promised him I would do everything in my power to allow him to age in place. In the end I realized that wasn't going to work even though we had contracted with two different agencies to make sure we had 24-hour coverage. One of the aides who was caught sleeping made a complaint to DCF. Kind of a CYA kind of incident.   He was difficult until the very end. Convinced I was stealing his money he kept asking for an attorney to cut me out of the will. After the DCF investigation he went to hospice to wait for a bed at the ALF I had selected for him last year.   In hindsight I should have listened to my therapist who advised me to let go of my relationship with my parents and my brother. But I had been trained to be a \"good daughter\".   Yes I'm getting my inheritance. However I'm going to have to use quite a bit of it to get counseling to overcome my PTSD and my bad feelings about myself because I don't mourn either of them.", "date": "2022-02-01 18:53:17", "user_name": "LilyBear", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/adult-children-abused-by-parents-who-are-now-elderly-467437.htm"},

{"post_id": "467437", "title": "Adult children abused by parents who are now elderly.", "body": "Hi Anonymous1  I was beaten so badly that I have permanent physical scars. My NM claims that it is all in my head and that she has done nothing to be forgiven for. She now 'uses' her age to be extra cruel verbally and emotionally abusive and as an excuse for her behaviour.  I did have care &amp; love shown to me by my great-aunt. When my mother wasn't looking she would feed care for me and love hold me.  My NM does have dementia but can be 'normal' for all doctor community ageing worker visits and so on.  I was always on egg shells trying to please. As an adult I lived with 'the guilt' of being such a \"terrible child\" so that it was my fault that I was beaten abused and humiliated She does her 'act' all the time. She is so good at manipulation and threats that lawyer and doctor are afraid to sign any documentation. I can't get her any other more help without it.  I am expected to be her help. My 'golden-child' sister lives so far away and won't really help me.   I have found out that I am now getting very sick. I think is was the stress I have endured that has actually damaged my heart and body. . Whenever I try to explain to mom that I am too weak or too tired to talk for longer than 30 minutes. then her phone calls and retaliation; get more and more meaner.  She continues to expect me to be at her beckon call even though I have tried to explain that I am sick. Apparently cancer is my fault. It is was and will always be about her.   As children of abusive mothers it is hard to believe that there is real dementia and not just another excuse to abuse us.  I thought I had forgiven my mother many years ago.  Though I can never forget what she did to me and continues to do to me.   I am also a mother who has made many mistakes with my own children now 34 32 30.  Sadly you are so right... you do reap what you sew. I never hit/hurt burnt slashed them called them names belittled them criticized or took away hope or set them up for a fall. I did try to give them better life than I had... but.... it was not enough.   I know that \"you can't give what you don't have\".  I probably did not try hard enough to overcome my upbringing because my boys all have problems; with me and with the world.  After your parent dies you won't get the chance to offer forgiveness. By giving forgiveness you can get forgiveness from others.   I think that abusive narcissists will abandon anyone and everyone (including children siblings 'friends' and parents) if that person is no use to them.  In fact they might walk over and kick a small hungry child--- unless someone is watching.. then they make a HUGE deal out of giving them a dollar.  It is my belief that trying to forgive will at least show you that you have an inner strength that was not pulled out of you and trampled on. Forgiveness is not for the forgiven but for the forgiver.

{"post_id": "471716", "title": "How could I SAY that?", "body": "So this isn't so much a question as it is something I need to get off my mind or I'll go crazy. My mom (65) has had two strokes this year and at least in my opinion although it hasn't been diagnosed yet is suffering from dementia of some kind. I have lived with her since 2005 and although we had a great relationship we are both hot-tempered and have had our share of fights. After mom had her second stroke and it was clear that she would need full-time care I turned down a well-paying new job and have since devoted myself to caring for her alone. This has been since October 18th of this year and I am ashamed to say it but I have already had like four or five meltdowns. And I'm talking screaming crying hysterical meltdowns to the point where I've wanted to kill myself where I've wanted her to die where I've said incredibly terrible things and punched walls and actually threw and broke a portable grill on my kitchen floor. I have accidentally put bruises on my mom's wrists because I was trying to stop her from kicking me (again) and felt so guilty about it that I contemplated contacting my aunt to come take care of her because I thought I was unfit. I have said things to my own mother like \"I hope the next stroke kills you!\" \"I wish you were dead!\" \"I regret brining you home from the hospital!\" \"I hate you!\" and so on. I have felt instantly guilty when these horrible words burst out of me I have apologized and my one saving grace is that my mom doesn't remember any of this but I do and it breaks my heart and will be a stain on my soul that no amount of time or forgiveness will ever get rid of.  So in my dark hours lying awake in bed at night after another long and miserable day of trying to take care of this woman who I love more than anyone else and who I would do anything for I ask myself one question over and over...How could I SAY that? How could I say these things that no human being should ever say to another? How could I say these things to my mother who is the most amazing person I've ever known who raised me and loved me and made my childhood happy and safe? How could I get so angry at this person who is clearly sick and can't help it? How can I even think these things about my mother who deserves so much better than this than me? I have tortured myself with these questions and so many more. I have felt guilt so raw and intense that it cripples me and keeps me from getting out of my chair and makes it so I can't sleep. I thought I would die from the weight of the shame I felt. But then I started to answer my own questions and I'll tell you how I can say these things that are horrible and that I don't mean. They come from fear from exhaustion from sadness and desperation and resentment and feeling trapped. These words come from anger and guilt and stress and not knowing how long this situation is going to last or how bad it will get. These words come from having to give up my job my life and some of my sanity to take care of a woman who can be childish mean-spirited combative and aggressive. These words come from being sick of changing diapers and cleaning sheets and being kicked and grabbed and having to fight her for every inch of everything. These words come from the exhaustion of just trying to get her up and clean and dressed for a doctors appointment and knowing that it is going to be a struggle the entire way because she is completely unmotivated to do anything. These words and feelings come from knowing that when I try to give her her meds she'll most likely slap them out of my hand again. These words come from her lack of hygiene and having to deal with her horrible breath and dirty hair and having to wash her in the shower. These words come from having to clean down the entire bathroom at least twice every day and trying not to gag on how disgusting it all is. These words come from grief and the loss of our lives being happy and free.

Today on Facebook I received a message from a friend of my mothers. She want me to call her. Which I did.    it\u2019s so sad this woman was very helpful when my mom had gotten distrustful with my sister and me. She worked my mother. She helped with my mothers financial issues which my mom did not trust us.   she told me today that her sister has dementia she lives in Utah. This friend of my mothers live in California where I lived. A family member had her placed in a faculty which she escaped from and ended up in Wyoming.   this friend of my mothers (name is Nancy) Nancy is dying from cancer and can\u2019t go to Utah to help. This family member in Utah did get POA. How can they help her when she is difficult and combative?   I suggested they find a doctor or neurologist who specializes in dementia get her on an anti depressant even if it is capsule that they can open to put in her food or something like a juice. Find a facility that has a security system where they use a security bracelet on her sister so if she tries to leave the bracelet will set off alarms. My understanding is the family member trying to take care of Nancy\u2019s sister is older as well.   Nancy says she can\u2019t talk with her sister because she gets difficult accusing them of taking her money and home from her. I suggested redirecting her thoughts to things they know her sister enjoys\u2026.knitting gardening etc.   I also suggested if there is a family member who can gain her trust a granddaughter/grandson/niece etc that can help as well. If you all remember my mom did not trust my sister yet she trusted me and I could work with my mom to get her to be more cooperative.   if any of you have more suggestions to help Nancy I would appreciate it. Nancy was a blessing to us and I want to try to help her any way I can", "date": "2022-03-27 02:12:33", "user_name": "SharynMMarie", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm"},

That\u2019s not my personal email though it\u2019s a company email.  I thought The whole point of this forum was how coming from dysfunctional families can add weight to caregiving. My only purpose of sharing something either from my own personal experience website or information I know of that was to share something supportive of caregivers.   Because of my knowledge and experience of the many issues and daily challenges of caregivers especially individuals working 24/7 without a support system my purpose is to help outside siblings to see that their daily challenges is everyone\u2019s problem and crisis in the family. This is especially true if the person is a sick parent with adult children.   We hear a lot about caregiving burnout and how this can take a physical and emotional toll on the caregivers health but unless you are the sibling working without support you may not be aware of what they go through.   I\u2019ve seen videos and information a wealth of information that shows if that Main Family Caregivers health breakdown then the family could have two sick people needing help the caregiver and the person needing care and the burden of responsibility could fall on another sibling unexpectedly.   I know of a personal experience where this happened in a family that did not communicate like they should with each other about their mothers health with dementia. One weekend out of no where that sibling decided to take Momma to visit another sibling for the weekend with the intention of leaving her. This is exactly what they did and overnight that siblings life and household changed.   This is why for families that can put aside any differences when a love one needs total care if they can have a plan of action in place and learn how to work together it can take some of the load off of just one individual and the burden of responsibility does not have to be placed abruptly on another sibling.   When a medical situation happens that forces a family member to need total care many families are at a lost of what to do. This only adds to an already dysfunctional family. How nice it is if people are aware that there may be other options task and responsibilities each member can take on. But is starts by members being willing to put aside their differences and look at the problem at hand as \u201cOur Family Crisis Our Family Emergency.\u201d", "date": "2022-03-26 00:52:10", "user_name": "LynnelT4shs", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/the-caregiver-dysfunctional-families-149068.htm"},

She can live another 2 or 3 decades and where does that leave YOU? You need to think about the next step here; how to get mom on Medicare and then apply for Medicaid to get her placed because you can't and shouldn't go on like this; it's not healthy for either one of you. Keeping mom home has to work for BOTH of you and clearly it's not so something has to change. Having meltdowns doesn't mean you're a bad person; just that you're an exhausted and burned out person and rightly so!   I grew up with a mother who agreed to take her mother into our house and they did not get along. My mother was extremely resentful of having my grandmother living with us and it wreaked havoc in the house all the time. Nobody was happy. Mom should have made other arrangements for grandma so that BOTH of them could have had a better life meaning ALL of us would have had better lives; dad and myself included. Instead she felt like she 'had' to keep grandma in our house out of some misguided sense of duty when grandma would have been better off in a nursing home! Ultimately mom cried uncle and sent grandma off to an aunt's home to live and the aunt said No Way and sent her to a nursing home where she did fine. She lived to be 91 and died in her sleep one night peacefully with a smile on her face. It should have been done YEARS earlier.  Please take your life back and allow yourself to HAVE a life now. You deserve to. If I had to live with and care for my mother I'd have shot myself honestly. I could NEVER do it in a million years! She lives in Assisted Living since 2014 and in Memory Care since 2019 thank God. She's doing fine and I have enough on my plate managing her entire life finances doctors etc!

{"post_id": "472781", "title": "Just want to tell my story to help others.", "body": "Last year in December my husband and I moved my parents to live with us. We had prayed for years as we had seen them declining and falling apart both in health and ability to care for one another that we would be able to serve them this way. I must confess how naive we were. We love them dearly but the last year consisted of 5 hospitalizations 2 stints in rehab and too numerous to count doctors visits (with tests as all the Dr's were new and wanted to do their own testing) and that was just my father....we also have my mom with us who has parkinsons along with other illnesses. Dad was WC bound for the most part but he always believed he was fine and could walk again soon. 10 months of mult days a week PT did not change anything and he still declined.My husband and I quickly saw signs of dementia in both of them. Dad was tested and early stage Alz confirmed. Mom will be tested soon.Both gave up drivers licenses when they came.In Aug dad was diagnosed with biliary duct cancer and b/c of comorbities was not a candidate for any treatment. I was encouraged to bring in hospice early for the support and he did have a VA provided care giver 3 hrs in the morning. He passed away on Christmas day this year at home with the family around him.We now are in a new season of walking my mom through grieving the loss of her husband of 60 years with no real support system near by except my husband and I.I was an ICU nurse for over 20 years and can honestly say this was the hardest year of my life. So much we didn't know going in. I would not have necessarily changed them living with us but maybe we would have moved to where they were? It's so much harder for them to create new support networks than for us.I definitely should have picked a gerontologist instead of trying to mimic what they had in TX. By the time my dad passed he had 12 doctors! I never thought through how different our dietary preferences would be and become such an issue or prepare for setting boundaries. Obviously had not spent enough time with them to know where they were each were truly at.I never considered how difficult creating a social and support system would be for them (or the effects on my own as most of my time was at home) I had planned on returning to work in January after they came in December. NAIVE!! I actually returned to work part time in May.My husband and I consistently have to work to stay on the same team and make time for one another. This challenges us as we do not have children and had nothing but time together prior. These are not complaints but observations. We are grateful that the Lord does not give more than we can handle and his grace is new every day.I would encourage everyone consider spending as much time as you can 24/7 with them. Know who they are. Set realistic boundaries and discuss ahead of time. Definitely use a gerontologist to help you know what care is really necessary for the stage of life.Consider in advance if your marriage can withstand the pressures.That is all for now..thank you for listening.This forum has been a lifeline last year as I realized we were not alone.Thank you all so much!!", "date": "2022-02-01 14:13:11", "user_name": "Rbarbacane", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Care Decisions", "Caregiver Support", "Family Caregiver"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/just-want-to-tell-my-story-to-help-others-472781.htm"},

I\u2019ve also been dealing with a senior kitty with health issues and she stopped eating on Saturday. It could have been because I was transitioning her back to kitten food which has higher fat and calories which may have caused tummy upsets. I took her back to tge shelter on Monday their vet gave her additional fluids a b 12 injection and gave me an ointment to put in her ear every 24-48 hours to stimulate her appetite. They had already given the ointment in her ear. So far I have not had to give more. Today she is eating normally and she is getting lots of attention from my grandsons this week due to spring break.

You continue to do what you're comfortable with and the hell with what everyone else thinks.   I was abused by both parents and was fortunate that I lived thousands of miles away from them as they both aged so didn't have to be a part of their care. But even if I had lived right next store I would have opted out as well.  Now all that being said I did long ago forgive my parents as I had to to be able to move on with my life in somewhat of a healthy way so I hope in time you will be able to do that as well. Remember forgiveness is not done to benefit the abuser(s) but it is done to benefit you. And even though I forgave them I still chose to remain out of their lives as it was just healthier for me to do so.

{"post_id": "472748", "title": "Argumentative, OCD, hoarding, bizarre behavior - could be low serotonin levels (and what helped my mom)", "body": "Thought I would share my experience in case others have the same problem since it helped in my case. TL DR: strange behavior and bad attitude / disagreeableness were 90% caused by low serotonin levels and I was able to greatly improve them.Short background: I had to step up as caregiver for my mom late last year since she could no longer be counted on to take care of herself (ate poorly - not enough good food - craved junk food but still underweight). In trying to help her I noticed some behaviors from her that she had never shown before.Any time I tried to get her to do something there would be an argument. If I told her she needed to do something or I offered a new idea she would disagree before three words left my mouth. She started to horde things (in her bedroom her chair in the living room the kitchen table). She'd get easily distracted while eating - if she saw a plastic bag on the kitchen table she'd pick it up and start futzing with it. It was so bad I had to clear everything off the table and hide things just to get her to eat.Then the bizarre behavior - weird bathroom habits / obsessions walking around without pants / underwear. Insisting that our Senator was on the radio late at night giving recommendations on what to eat (it was a late night talk show host reading commercials). Couldn't be convinced of anything that went against what she thought was true.She went on and on about old things that upset her - when I would address one she'd move on to another thing then another and then circle back to the first item in a never ending loop.She has Alzheimer's but this was a rapid progression from where she was just months before. She mentioned not sleeping so I started researching natural substances to help her sleep. Along the way I saw someone mention low serotonin levels causing problems like she was having. I found a video that listed these symptoms: (don't know if I can post links but the video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_IiJmIL9ss&amp;t=516s)- Frequent feeling of sadness - Constant worrying - Upset when things don't go your way (rigid/inflexible) - Upset when things are out of place - Tend to be oppositional or argumentative - Repetitive negative thoughts - You don't like change - Tend to hold grudges - Trouble shifting attention from subject to subject - Trouble shifting behavior from task to task - Difficulty seeing options - Tendency to hold on their own opinion and not listening to others - Tendency to be locked in a course of action - Needing to have things done in a certain way - Others complain that you worry too much - Tend to say \"no\" without thinking - Tend to predict fearShe had every one of them.I found people suggesting Saint John's Wort to help with low serotonin levels. I found a bottle of liquid SJW drops without a bunch of chemicals and ordered it. Those two days waiting for amazon to deliver took forever. While waiting I cleared it with her doctor to make sure it wouldn't affect her regular medication.I started with one drop in a glass of water. No side effects so I went to 2. Soon It was up to 3 drops in the morning and 2 at night. Along the way all the bad behavior started to slowly improve. She stopped arguing about every little thing. She didn't mind when my sister or I cleaned up the clutter that she didn't want to get rid of just weeks ago. Her actions were more rational her obsessions were greatly reduced. She could eat without without getting distracted by everything (but she still eats too slow - can't change 80 year old habits).Her poor sleep habits still cause problems but as long as I keep the SJW flowing all the symptoms she had are greatly reduced.If you have a LO with similar problems check out serotonin levels. Diet changes can help SJW worked for my mom but make sure to check with their doctor first - SJW can interfere with meds (like heart medications) so you definitely don't want to start it without getting approval.", "date": "2022-01-31 09:59:29", "user_name": "Thought", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Behavior Change", "Medications", "Mental Health"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/argumentative-ocd-hoarding-bizarre-behavior-could-be-low-serotonin-levels-472748.htm"},

But many guilt feelings have nothing to do with illegal acts but instead are about what a caregiver did or didn't do in caring for their LO.Whether caring for your parents your spouse or another LO you may feel guilt if - You were a difficult child You mistreated your LO before their diagnosis You wished your LO died You placed your LO in a care facility You wanted time apart from your LO You got angry with LO You feel guilty for what you should have done or what you didn't do. Etc. etc.None of these are illegal \u201cshould have\u201d or \u201cshouldn't have\u201d feelings but they are feelings of guilt nevertheless. Often the feelings of guilt are part of the grieving process. The two can co-exist. But one can grieve w/o guilt. One can also feel guilt outside of the grieving process. Guilt can be overcome and grieving can be more difficult and last longer but can also be worked through. All of the above feelings I mention above don't have to result in guilt.Realizing there is no playbook for dementia care and that you're doing your best can help fight off the guilt trips. Although there are many resources that can help manage the caregiving experience no two experiences are alike so it's mostly a matter of on the job learning. Videos of Teepa Snow books like The 36 Hour Day Surviving Alzheimer's and Learning to speak Alzheimer's can be very helpful but may not apply to your situation. You may have to \u201cfigure it out\u201d. Dr. Peter Rabins coauthor of the 36 Hour Day offers ways to prevent guilt in caring for a LO.

{"post_id": "472748", "title": "Argumentative, OCD, hoarding, bizarre behavior - could be low serotonin levels (and what helped my mom)", "body": "It helps but it's not a miracle in all situations. A couple of days ago my dad caused some emergencies at home. While I was trying to deal with them he kept calling on my mom to help him get clothes and other things he wanted (despite me repeatedly telling him not to). Since she has problems remembering things she couldn't follow through half the time then he'd get upset when he had no right to.   All that stress and everything else going on basically overloaded her - it got her so wound up that the benefits of SJW couldn't keep up. Now I'm trying to bring her back down to earth.  The next day (Actually early AM) she was acting obsessive about a financial matter that had been handled years ago. 3 people couldn't convince her it was handled it took her calling my brother (while at work) who handles that end that she was in fact wrong. And today she was back to obsessing about eating the horrible junk food that makes her worse. It's not happening with every little thing like it was before but she's latching on to some things like she did months ago.   Now I just have to work to get her to stay calm and relaxed and remind my dad repeatedly that I'm the one he should be calling when something needs to be done not my mom.  As far as treating low Serotonin. SJW isn't the only option but it's one of the few I can use with her. Meditation can help but she's not one for that. I tried 10hz meditative music (alpha brainwave frequencies) which helps me relax - but she hates that. Improving diet helps but I struggle just to get her to eat enough to maintain weight. Light therapy can help too but getting her to do it and juggle her and my dad is getting more and more difficult.  Beyond that is heavy duty psych medications but I'd rather avoid the side effects and she hates pills as it is so those are out. So SJW has become the easiest most reliable thing. I just wish it didn't give me a headache when I take it - because I could use it too with all the stress.  Anyway if anyone is out there experiencing the same I hope they find this and at least look into low serotonin levels as part of the cause of those problems.", "date": "2022-02-02 20:03:27", "user_name": "Thought", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/argumentative-ocd-hoarding-bizarre-behavior-could-be-low-serotonin-levels-472748.htm"},

The last I remember she was in an ALF but planning to move back home against your better judgment.   I have been using Brene\u2019 Browns latest book as a reference book recently. She discusses human emotions and shares her sources. Under grief she mentions different types of grief that we go through. Some not conventionally recognized as grief. That would be Disenfranchised Grief.  Situations that need grieving where there are no traditional mourning practices.  Also there are three types listed from The Center for Complicated Grief. Acute grief Integrated grief and Complicated grief.   Although the explanation of Complicated Grief from The Center for Complicated Grief is different from this I think all caregivers have a complicated grief.   Being \u201cthe last\u201d and feeling the full weight of that is certainly an occasion for grief. In your case from reading your posts over the years I wonder if you aren\u2019t also suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? You have been through a lot with your parents. We all have been through a lot in our lives and it is so good that you are honoring yourself with searching for support.  Perhaps your next therapist should be one with training in complicated grief work? Whether your mom has passed or not you have been grieving for a long time. Very understandable.   So after writing that about Brene\u2019 Brown I wondered what she would say about trauma. I did a google and came across a great podcast transcript of hers with Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Bruce Perry about their book \u201cWhat Happened To You? Conversations on Trauma Resilience and Healing\u201d. It might be helpful.   One last thing and perhaps not so heavy as my other suggestions is Ancestry.com When I started on ancestry years ago it was only for a few minutes at a time. My mom loved genealogy and I would look up things for her. After awhile I realized that I felt more connected to my family and that I wanted to know more. Reading the census records gave me a feeling of being with those great greats back in the day Sometimes I was shocked to see how long ago they lived as their stories were so relatable. Previous to this my eyes would roll back in my head when the genealogy subject came up. It was like reading the fine print of an insurance policy to me until I felt the connection.

You have diabetes too that needs to be under control.  After she is stable you should see a change in her. It may take a while but you should see a change. If she still shows signs of a Dementia then you need to see a Neurologist to give u that diagnosis.  I would not consider Hospice until she is stable and has physical therapy.

I just finished up this semester with all A's even in chemistry which I was terrified I would do so poorly in. God really helped me through it.

I will tell you that going to school at this time in my life has been possibly foolish and super difficult. But with God's help I am managing.   AB had 2 more episodes. We finally hired some help for him because Mom is my priority and well I just cannot do it all you all have taught me that. :) Mom is doing well God really takes good care of that woman. She has a check up next week.  The goats are so cute and quite therapeutic for me. I just love having them as pets. DH says we will not worry about milking until I have completed school. That is a load off. The babies still drink so Moms are not going to get mastitis or anything and I keep a watchful eye on them. But I just love them so much they are a blessing.

It is COLD!!! So I have 7 goat babies. Sarah had her two on the 25th of Jan. A boy and a Girl Jada and Job. Rebecca had hers on the 26th two girls and a boy Zeeb Mary and Rhoda. Abigail had hers on the 28th two sweet girls Chloe and Phoebe. All Bible names. :) I had to help Rebecca and Abigail Deliver they had some issues. It was the most amazing scary exciting and beautiful thing I have ever gotten to do. It was Awesome to say the least. Sarah had no issues and actually kidded in between my 30 minute checks on them. It was quick for her. I stayed with Abigail all night before she delivered because I knew it was anytime and her being a first timer I wanted to make sure I was there if she had trouble which she did. In a few weeks we will be milking. We had to sell the 2 wethers. DH decided no males if we are going to have dairy goats. Because we rent a buck as needed. I did not want to sell them because they were sweethearts but they went to good homes. Now we are going to have some issues because Job has become special to me he is a sweetheart and I don't know if I will be able to sell him. I would like to keep him and breed him to the girls minus his mother and sister of course. But anyway we will see.  Lesson learned I will never again breed my does to kid in the middle of winter.   I have been staying tired with all thats going on and just don't seem to find and \"free\" time to do the things I wish to do.

I hope you all have a better Year than the last. I have missed you all dearly.  My does are due to kid any day now. I have been studying up on being a goat midwife :) My plate has been super full for a while now which is why I have not been able to visit here like I want. But I think of you all often and keep you in my prayers. I was studying Acts 27 this week and I found in it some things I never really thought about before and I have read that chapter many times over. Just thought I would share my thoughts on some of the verses. This is when Paul was set sail to Rome.  7-11 This part of the sailing was getting dangerous due to the winds and the like. Paul attempts to warn the people of the danger but rather than listen to a man of God they listened to their human wisdom. This reminds me of Ezekiel 33 when God said if the watchman warn the people of danger and they do not listen then it is on them. Well such is the case here. This verse is similar to Christian lives if we warn people of the danger of living without Jesus and they do not listen then it is on them. But if we do no warn them it may very well be on us. But like today\u2019s culture man\u2019s wisdom trumps God\u2019s wisdom unfortunately. 12-20 After being warned by Paul and not heeding the warning the ship and passengers underwent severe troubles. And in verse 20 when it says that no stars or sun appeared in many days and they were pretty much hopeless that would be an extremely difficult part of the journey. As in life when we go through trials and we feel all hope is lost because we cannot see the rainbow because of the storm it is hard. But here comes faith in the next verses. 21-26 After a period of silence Paul speaks up. He encourages the men that everything will be ok that their lives will be spared. Paul never lost faith in God and God\u2019s plan for him. As a child of God we can have that hope \u201cand know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to HIS purpose\u201d Romans 8:28. Paul knew even before this journey set sail that he would get to Rome because that is where God wanted him to go. These passages are such a good example of life. In our journey we have hard and perilous times yet our faith in God and knowing HE is working on our behalf will bring us to the other side where HE wants us to be.

I'm so glad you've read the book and found it as life-changing as I did. It actually helped me to put it into \"action\" while in an extremely toxic relationship with my half-sister who I never lived with and was 15 years older than myself. I terminated the relationship however when she was dying I did go to see her at my ex-BIL's and my mom's request. Nothing changed on her part with that visit. The day she was dying my mom aged 82 who had fallen and fractured her right wrist (driving hand) two days prior called me that morning and asked if I would drive her to the hospital which was an hour away. There was no way I would ever ever deprive my mom of seeing her daughter in spite of my own situation. We went and spent the day leaving at 4 p.m. As soon as we got back to my mom's house we received the call that my half sister had passed away.  What I liked about the book was it was extremely well written and interesting plus it had real life examples (although names were changed) and the chapters were broken down into the different relationship types it applied to once you read the introduction and first chapter. This makes it very easy to go back at any time and as you said \"re-read parts to refresh\" yourself.  Having worked in a mainstream church from 1993-1998 it's very easy to see how Christians can and do use \"guilt\" and other manipulative tactics all under the guise of Christianity. There is no harm in having the ability to use the word \"no\" when it protects yourself and the limits you want to set. In fact you absolutely should. Working on staff was where I actually learned \"how to say no.\" Even better is when you can say \"no\" without even having to give all kinds of reasons and explanations but that may take some time for some people to get to that point. I make the choice whether I want to explain my \"no\" further or not.  Whether or not your BIL and sister would intentionally do it or not only you would probably know the real answer to that since I don't know the background but I can tell you sometimes it's disguised really well and you have to be really in tune to the them. It could be that they're used to you being a \"go along with things\" type and therefore they can't imagine you not doing something they've requested from you. I think the main clue/answer is in your line about their lack of curiosity as to what plans you have and why - that to me is very telling and shows their motive.

I certainly seek and receive input from my husband friends etc. but ultimately all decisions are my own. I have financial and healthcare DPOA. There is some liberty that comes with being an only child for real.", "date": "2022-02-04 16:14:43", "user_name": "JillSuzanne", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/i-would-rather-be-an-only-child-472809.htm"},

Many many of us expect family and siblings to rally around to contribute an equal amount to the care of our elders only to be shocked and gravely disappointed and then angry. That being said no one can be assumed into a caregiving role and your siblings are under no moral or ethical obligation to care for their parents (and morality means their own not yours).   So you need to decide if you can come to having peace in your heart to being the only caregiver.   Next are you able to be the only caregiver? Do you have PoA for one or both of them? If so then you also have the ability to be the only one to make decisions in their (and your) best interests. You do not need to have any input or consensus about their care with your siblings. The caregiving arrangement only works if it works for both the care receiver and giver. If it is onerous to you you must find other solutions before you burnout.   You can choose to keep going along the same path down a road of bitterness or to make changes. If you are not the PoA then this is an issue. If no one is their PoA you must work to convince them to assign this responsibility to someone and the logical person right now is you (if you want to keep managing and providing their care). Please do this before they enter cognitive decline or they may not be legally able to assign a PoA at that point.

She is beginning with signs of dementia although she is still pretty self sufficient. She is the most negative person I have ever known. She has alienated my siblings and any friends that she had left.She is critical of everything and everyone. Today first thing this morning I get greeted with how much she hates my cat and wants to get rid of him because she didn\u2019t shut a cabinet door all the way and he pulled out paperwork she had in there. I reminded her that it was my house and my cat and she literally had a tantrum.Although she could do light housework she doesn\u2019t. She sits and watches tv all day. Then when the weekend comes and I\u2019m running around getting things done she says I\u2019m doing it either to make her feel bad or that I\u2019m bipolar (that\u2019s one of the newer accusations). Everything has to be about her. She takes no interest in anything going on in my life.I bought a new trash can for my kitchen and she says I have no idea how to handle my money and I\u2019m too frivolous.

My point being that many things can cause transitory dementia symptoms so it may have nothing to do with the cobalt.

{"post_id": "472854", "title": "Need to vent\u2026", "body": "Hi Amy &amp; welcome to the forum!  I'm sorry you are going through this with your mother. Why did you move her in with you if I may ask? My mother has always been a very negative individual as well which made me decide to NEVER move her in with me decades ago. So when I had to move both parents near me in 2011 after dad had to stop driving I set them up in a senior apartment bldg in Independent Living. I still did a ton FOR them it was just not inside my home; they had their place and my DH &amp; I had ours. Then after dad fell &amp; broke his hip I had to get them both into Assisted Living in 2014; dad passed in 2015 and mom stayed on in the same AL. It was a good thing too b/c she was diagnosed with progressive dementia in 2016. She became even more negative &amp; miserable in general so I was VERY relieved that she was in AL and not living with me. We were able to maintain our relationship intact that way vs. me having a ton of resentment and hating my life in my own home as you are feeling now.  Mom is now 95 and living in Memory Care AL wheelchair bound and incontinent. She has WAY too many issues to live anywhere BUT in managed care so she's where she belongs and very well cared for by the staff and visited by myself &amp; my DH frequently. Her dementia has progressed to the point where she's delusional almost all of the time so she thinks she's living in a hotel and going out to different restaurants and entertainment centers on a daily basis so that keeps her happy thankfully.  You have to figure out how to get your mom into her OWN place now preferably in Assisted Living that also has a continuum of care so she can segue into Memory Care when the time comes. You tell her that you love her very much but that you need your house back it's not working out for EITHER one of you to be living together. Period. She'll rant &amp; rave but in the end you're doing this to save your own sanity. She is manipulative and trying to guilt you into feeling pity for her by eating too little etc and that will only lead to you feeling MORE resentment and having the relationship suffer irreparable damage as well. Save it while you still can that's my suggestion. Let the staff in AL take care of her and deal with her tantrums as well; you can go visit her and spend some quality time together instead of this 24/7 situation going on now. If she accuses you of 'throwing her to the curb like trash' so be it. She'll get over it once she acclimates to AL. If you wind up hating her by keeping her in your home who wins then? Neither one of you. You're better off having her angry NOW than having a horrible relationship for the rest of your lives.  Here is a useful article on dementia called Understanding The Dementia Experience by Jennifer Ghent-Fuller; it's a 33 page booklet which is a free download:  https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/210580  It will help you understand what is going on in HER head nowadays and how you can deal with her in a more useful manner.   Wishing you the best of luck dealing with a difficult situation. I hope you agree to take care of YOURSELF now as well as your mother b/c there are TWO lives here that matter!", "date": "2022-02-04 22:06:25", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/need-to-vent-472854.htm"},

Wednesday evening he began to decline until his last breath Thursday evening.He was so good to me and others. I was chilled Wednesday night and bless his heart he tried to get me warm by laying blanket upon blanket on me. By the time I got out of all the cover we laughed. I wasn't cold any more. I still have to isolate as I have neutropenia fever. His memorial service is scheduled for Saturday a week.I am trusting my doctors will give me an okay to go. The church will have me by a door that only I will go in and out and the door will remain cracked for me to access fresh air everyone wearing masks (for my protection) and an 8' perimeter will be set up. I can't imagine not going and after 8 days of antibiotics I feel protected.This disease brought us closer to each other. His prayer was for us to leave this world together.

As I was aware they also told me she may not fit in due to being higher functioning. Her functionally is more akin to AL but the wandering and hampered memory which foster a certain amount of dependence pose an issue. The AL places I spoke with are not entire closed off facilities and the names I got would be out of my price range even if I was working and dedicated my entire salary. I also spoke to a couple of smaller end homes and their prices do make them slightly outside my reachSpoke with her PCP Doctor they are in favor of placement but would like her to have a one-to-one for companionship sake to avoid her bouts of anxiety.  I will be seeking a geriatric psych to explore medication options or how viable it would be considering the situation. Her behavior at home is manageable but the looking for people not respecting boundaries will be an issue in placement.I have explored some apartment options and looked into how to go about getting split shift aids covered through NY Medicaid I have an intake in March for that evaluation. I have a few places in mind will be looking at them see how viable they really are.I did want to say thanks for the information took a step back because I did get annoyed with having defend my love and commitment for my family over and over.

I'd explain it that some people have a greater sense of family responsibility than others and this may be due to any number of factors including (but not exclusively) how they were raised.

As you will know from your last thread opinions here vary. Always pick up what works best for you and leave the rest. And speaking of varying some here love the companies that are modeling on \"A Place for Mom\" and some hate them. The truth is I like them and they have worked well for those I know. BUT they will hassle you once you sign up and you DO have to give them personal information such as the assets of the senior (which some prefer not to divulge.) Once they gather information on the senior they take you to facilities they think a match. For an instance my brother's ex wanders. He has alcoholic encephalopathy and he will leave to buy spirits and is not safe out on the streets. He has a place now which is assisted living with separate cottage and which is still a locked cottage to prevent wandering. PERFECT and he loves it and says he's their favorite! So it worked for him. Now should you use one and then decide it is not for you (they are paid by the facilities in the area when the senior is placed) then just resign and when they call say \"I lied; she's on medicaid\".

{"post_id": "472965", "title": "Update: Towards my mothers situation.", "body": "I don't think I responded to your original post because I had seen certain people that I respect their opinions reply so I didn't.   Wandering is a Dementia thing. The one reason I placed my Mom in an AL was because at my house being a split level she was pretty much stuck in the room in the lower level. (She could not do stairs and I had 3 sets) The AL was like a square. The hallway went around inside the building with rooms on both sides. There were comfy chairs and couches book cases with books u could borrow. My Mom walked those halls a lot. Always coming back to the common area and dining/activity room. The AL had an outside area with a Gazebo and benches all around that was enclosed.  I think the care of a Dementia patient is beyond the care of a PCP. A PCP suggesting one on one care is not considering the cost to Mom. Because you should not be paying for that cost. My Mom was also in LTC. By that time she was wheelchair bound but could scoot around in that wc. The residents were allowed to wander the building. They are not confined. They would find one resident sleeping on another residents bed in another wing and walk her back to her wing. If Mom wanders at night there are sleep medications. There is also a night shift to keep an eye on her.   In my State ALs and MCs are private pay. Medicaid only gets involved when the resident has privately paid for at least 2 years. I was lucky 5 yrs ago to get Mom into an AL when they had a half price sale. It kept her cost just below 5k. Money ran out before 2 yrs so she was transferred to LTC with Medicaid paying. (Mom did pay 2 months privately) I see u have an appt with your State Medicaid. Be aware that their \"in home\" care may not pay for 24/7 care. Some States will only give a few hours. Can u be paid to be her caregiver or do they supply aides or do u go thru an agency that excepts Medicaid.  My daughter is an RN who worked in NHs with Dementia patients for 20 yrs. She was with me when we transferred Mom to LTC. After Mom was settled in my daughter said she thought I should have placed her earlier. No it wasn't perfect because Mom will never be cared for the way you would have cared for her. But my Mom was clean and cared for. On the whole the residents looked happy. I would visit and a staff member would be sitting talking to Mom. Others would tell me they had nice conversations with her. Mom was in her final stages.   So glad that you have made a geriatric psychiatric appt. Tests will now be done to determine where Mom is in her journey. What type of facility would most suit her. Kniwingcwhat type ofcDementia she has is important because of Medications.  Seems you are on the right track. Its just a matter of getting all the info you need to make informed decisions.

She likes to be out and about which is not an issue where we are because everyone knows her and she also knows the area very well. She is still operating on her long term memory at this point. The wandering more so will be an issue in places she is unfamiliar with.   They are willing to do an assessment but they told me not to hold my breath based off the conversation we had. I already knew AL was a long shot especially with me being honest with them going based off her worse day not the best. If I went based off her best then it would not be such an issue I think but that is unfair to the staff of the facilities rather be transparent with those involved in her care.   Like I exampled to them she is one of those residents that is easy to please just time consuming. I understand they are for 24/7 care but not a one-to-one companion service. That is more so where my mother is at she gets lonely and bored very easily unless she has some vested interest in the task and all parties are involved. Redirection is requires a more active approach since she still has some retention.   She is EO in terms of raw functional behavior but memory is more so at the Mid to serve stage. As her doctor has put it to me many times she is able to function based around her long deep seeded routine. We have explored medication in the past her current doctor has been against it. They are more in favor of non medication interventions. She has also been my mothers doctor since I was a kid. My mom still remembers them and trusts them.

This means that they can no longer be reached by phone the calls immediately go to voice mail. In the past the fix was for me to drive across town to reset their phone. I've now figured out a great solution to the problem that allows their phones to be reset remotely either across town or across the country.I don't know if this will work on all phones but it does work on more than one version of Panasonic cordless phones. To test if it will work on your phone end a phone call without pressing OFF this will put the phone in the unreachable state. Then unplug the base station phone from power and after a few seconds plug it back in again. If this resets all the phone to working order then this solution will work for you.Knowing that the power reset fixes the problem I realized there was a good solution. The solution is to plug the base station power into a smart plug. The smart plug that I had available was one from tp-link while at my mother's house I used her wifi (yes your parent will need to have a wifi connection) to configure the smart plug. I set up a dedicated account that I log into using the Kasa app from my phone and from there it is very easy to turn the smart plug (and the phone plugged into it) off and then back on again. So now when I notice my mother's phone is unreachable I log into the app and and reset her phone while sitting on my sofa at home. The Kasa app login can also be used by my sisters if they notice the problem before me.The app could also be programmed to reset the phone every night when your mother is sleeping (if configured in this way the reset would happen regardless of the state of the phone) so that her phone will be available to callers in the morning.I don't know if anyone else has this problem but both my mother's have the problem so I think it's probably pretty common and the fix is so good that I wanted to share it.", "date": "2021-10-24 18:28:30", "user_name": "JorgeVerde", "reply": false, "keywords": ["Alzheimer's & Dementia", "Long-distance Caregiving"], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/wonderful-trick-to-remotely-reset-cordless-phone-of-parent-who-doesnt-press-off-button-470787.htm"},

If we did it out of reciprocal love and care this wouldn't be an issue.  I think many of us do it because we love our parents regardless of what kind of parent they were or are. Which can be the same or two entirely different people.  I agree with JoAnn that an abused child should not be a hands on caregiver. Making sure they are getting the care they need is the only way to not stay triggered all the time especially if they haven't changed. I think it is also a dangerous situation for elder abuse to occur particularly when the parent treats the adult as a child that is under their authority and needs to be submissive.  For me I help because they need(ed) it and I am the only one willing.   If I treated them the way they treated me that's means I am no different than them and have no room to talk or be hurt by their actions. I also believe that vengeance is not mine. I am only answerable for my actions not theirs.  Good boundaries are vital when we decide to help our elder parents or anybody for that matter.

'Blood ties' have nothing to do with it in my case b/c these are not my biological parents but my adoptive ones.

Why would she 'like' your visits ? They should upset her actually if you keep telling her about stopping eating &amp; drinking &amp; taking 30 pills a day to keep you alive!   Your mother is suffering from dementia and is having a pity party for herself. As such yes she's ruining your entire mood when you go visit her so you know in advance what to expect from her. What I do when I visit my mother who lives in Memory Care &amp; has advanced dementia is I bring distractions to keep her OFF of the complaining subjects she likes to dwell on. I bring my dog who likes to sit on her lap and I bring my cell phone which is filled with videos and photos of her great-grandson which she likes to look at. Even the ones she's seen before and has forgotten about. I'll even pull up photos on Facebook of her nieces and nephews if I run out of other things to keep her occupied. I also bring snacks which she likes a lot so that's another thing to keep her occupied for a short while.   Find uplifting things to talk about and do rather than depressing things that add to her already funky mood that's my suggestion. It's not easy having dementia and living in Memory Care with other elders suffering from dementia that's a fact!

Dawn007  I get where you're coming from about gaslighting in the medical profession. It's disgraceful. No family should ever have to make it their life's work to stay on top of everything in the care facility or hospital their loved one is in every moment of the day. Sadly we do have to because that's pretty much the healthcare system for the elderly and family has to do the advocating on behalf of their own. There has never been a nurse social worker or other healthcare professional who has ever gotten away with rolling an eye placating or making a snotty retort to me. When dealing with these people you can't get mad and lose your temper. I never do. I will have straight answers though. Or I will get the bit between my teeth and not let it go until someone loses a job. It's a shame what people have to do just to make sure their elderly are being decently cared for.

I couldn't tell you how many countless elders I've said this to. That they're not a burden because they need help around the house or with personal care or running errands like shopping or a doctor's appointment.  The \"burden\" is the narcissism. It's the assuming that the family will simply be \"voluntold\" that they are the old-age care plan. It's the expectation that family will simply accept their new life in nanny-slavery with joy in their hearts and smiles on their faces. It's the instigating and trouble making for sport. It's the endless complaining. It's the stubbornness that often crosses over to dangerous absurdity. It's the orneriness over nothing and the \"performances\" (such things as a totally unnecessary trip to the ER because to make sure you miss out on something you've been looking forward to). It's the sense of entitlement like the whole world owes them simply because they were lucky enough to not die young and were able to become elderly. It's the cheapness (even when they have money) and unwillingness to pay the actual price for what things cost. It's overdoing the neediness unnecessarily. Everyone here knows what I mean. So many seniors like children will behave as if they are incapable of the slightest independence and can't do anything for themselves. Not because they actually are but because they want to be catered to and waited upon by acting like helpless infants. Then they resent it when people treat them like helpless infants. When this behavior doesn't achieve the desired outcome they evolve to being a \"senior brat\" and a whole new kind of attention-seeking tantrums start up.

This is because the child was \"raised to be\" what they are--afraid of the parent obligated to the parent starved for the parent's approval. I had just about the best parents in the world. They raised me to be independent to know that the world would require that of me to go out on my own and make my own life and family to care for THEM in the best way I was able. They made themselves safe and comfortable by moving into a village in which care could progress for them as needed allowing them first a duplex then into apartment then onto different levels of care when needed. They saved all their lives so as not to be dependent on their children. They taught US my brother and me how to save. It is the eagle story you know. The eagle's nest is on an island and there is a terrible storm and the eagle must try to save it's eaglets as the waters rise. First the father takes one eaglet across the raging waters. During the flight he asks the babe \"And when I am old and tired will you save me alike\" and the chick replies \"Oh yes father; I WILL\" and this eaglet the father bird drops at once into the raging waters where it quickly perishes. The father goes then for the next and last babe and while crossing asks the same question of it. The baby answers \"Oh father I am so sorry; I cannot promise you this. But I promise you I will carry your lesson for life and I will do all I can to save my OWN babies\". This chick was carried to safety. The way of it is that our parents have children whether by choice happenstance. They do all they can for them given their limitations. And the children should pay this forward.

Maybe its the word 'owe' that is the problem. I do believe that no child abused by a parent should physically care for that parent. I don't think we should give up jobs and our homes to care for them. Bringing them into our homes is not always a good thing either.   Once we leave our parents home we really can't go back. (I had to and 1 year was enough) We change. We grow and mature. We have different experiences than our parents. Our views are no longer the same. We are now adults with jobs homes and our own families. But as we age so do our parents. They need to rely on someone and it should be their children. And as children we should at least make sure they are safe and cared for. Help find them resources. Set them up in a care facility. You can then walk away.   In a perfect world the child graduates from high school and maybe college. At that point the child starts a life of their own. Marries at that point that family becomes #1. Once the nest is empty the parent should be finding things that interest them get involved. New stage in their life. Neither child or parent should need to rely on each other. But that's not the real world. We have children who rely on parents to live and visa versa. Both spending money they don't have. Drugs and alcohol go both ways.   Its a shame that there is abuse in families and those who did the abusing then expect that child to care for them in their old age. And its a shame that that child feels obligated. In that situation a child needs to know its OK to walk away. We all need to set BOUNDRIES. What we can do and what we can't do. And it would be nice if our parents excepted this and did what needed to be done to be safe and cared for. Can't keep your house up then you downsize. Need 24/7 care then you go to an AL or LTC. You don't ask ur children to give up their lives so you can continue to live in a dream world. Its not being independent when you expect a child to do all the work and sacrifice so you can stay put.

Second at least one and possibly more than one of the theypresent children--all but the minor--might not be home for anything but the holidays. A couple of them I believe were Ivy-league educated (i.e. Columbia or \"Hudson U\" as it was referred to so presumably they'd be the most apt to move on with their own lives as their peers presumably have. The dad is supposed to be this big undercover cop and the story would realistically collapse if he could not fulfill this role and realistically his kids should not be expected to help with grandma now that mom is dead.  It could be an interesting story arc to see how this unfolds but we all know what happens.  Grandma Bernie should never have been taken in as that will potentially force at least one of the grandkids--whose decision it wasn't--to do what Dad can't do given Dad's schedule.

He set that boundary. Like his parents he shares almost a phobia about seeing them naked let alone handling private parts.  BW doesn't have to really handle any actual ADLs but the time is coming.

At $65K/year she is a paid professional. A professional does not beg her employers to replace the money that she lost through all fault of her own by having her own meltdown at the clients. A professional also does not just time her social occasions with my SO's weekend and then gaslight him with \"it's you're PARRENTS\" and all this when she would like to do something else. A professional would take it upon themselves to be educated about what the loss of ADLs actually is. FIL came home and wetted himself wanna know what she did? Nothing. And probably she could do nothing. MIL cleaned him up as she didn't want her child's wife to see his penis.  It's not like most situations here where most people are unpaid. She is handsomely paid.

Of course that is his choice -and it is also their choice not to accommodate him. Glad you are holding firm to your boundaries and know what you can and can't do. I had to pull the plug on loaning money to my dil. It escalated and repayment was very slow and reluctant. She doesn't talk to me anymore and that's OK.   ((((((Pam)))))) I understand this so well. My sis is like your bil. She wants me to be her servant. Until your hub realizes he is being used and doesn't want to play that game anymore it will keep happening. I guess you know that already. The only thing that I can see you being able to do it set boundaries which you did by saying don't deliver let bro come and pick up his own meat. Personally I would set the limit of not buying anything more for bro. You earn money that goes into the family coffers. You have a say in how it is spent! I came to a better awareness of these kind of dynamics in my family relationships by the on-my-behalf indignation of friends as to how I was being treated.

They need $1495 to pay the movers who will be delivering their belongings the next day Sunday February 27. I told her we can\u2019t. We already gave them $750 before they left California which we told them they have 2 years to pay back. They got the money from her two sisters.   we are having to cut back which includes dropping Direct TV and selling my hubs Jeep to pay off the loan. I can\u2019t drive the Jeep because I have too much pain with the seats and the seats can\u2019t be adjusted close enough for my short legs to comfortably use the gas and break pedals. Yes I am tall but I\u2019m short legged Lol! We told them we can\u2019t help.   In May we plan on a trip to Colorado to bring them two end tables and a tv table I bought second hand.

We have been through two surgeries in two weeks and she has fought through a lot of pain that woman is TOUGH ( God gives her strength that is for sure). It has hurt my heart to have to tend to her battle wounds but we are getting it done. I have seen the test results (yet the Dr. has not called we will see him on Tuesday for stitches removal) but i believe what I am reading is that the last surgery showed that the cancer did not spread to her lymph nodes (Thanks be to God). It has been difficult.....  I have been working hard at my schooling so that you all will be proud... :)  I hope you all are doing ok and relying on the Lord for all things.

Aside from unforeseen unavoidable and \"bad luck\" events in some people's lives a main reason why receiving and giving care becomes a burden is because people are in denial and they don't plan and save. There are other factors like the cost of medical care and people who choose unhealthy habits but mostly many people just don't plan early enough.  My mom (the daughter of immigrants) was a single parent the entire time she was raising me (an RN who worked FT). She never received a penny of child support. YET she went on to own her own home (a humble home later in life and paid cash for it) owns her car has no other debt and lives comfortably on her savings. Because of clean living and the luck of the draw she is a very healthy 92-yr old. She has good financial means right now but if she has a profound medical issue she will burn through her savings pretty fast. Most people's life savings are used up in the last 18 months of their lives. At some point if she requires Medicaid so be it. This is what it's for (also funded by taxes).   Creating an adult care tax credit will require management by the government. Our large and inefficient government. Everyone else's taxes will go up to fund yet another program. IMO we should be lobbying for more transparency in medical and care costs so that there is accountability and we can vote with our wallets.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "I'm a 36 year old only child of a single mother. My mom has had two strokes this year and is now recovering at home with me. She pays the rent and since I had to turn down a well-paying job to care for her 24/7 I am terrified about financial problems. She did not sign up for Social Security or Medicare before her stroke so now I am trying to backtrack all of that. It is exhausting dealing with bills endless phone calls mountains of paperwork and having to do it all alone because I really don't have anyone else (I have people who offer to help but those offers seem to disappear almost as quickly as they're spoken). I am an organized and efficient person but this is all a little much and the never-ending hoops that the government makes you jump through to get anything done are ridiculous and frustrating.  Add to that I'm really sick of being a caregiver already and it's only been like two weeks (she was in the hospital for a week came home for a week went in for another week and is now back home). I had no idea that burnout could set in this quickly or that I would be feeling the level of anger that I feel. My mom is a great person and was an amazing mother but quite frankly as a care recipient she's a pain in the butt sometimes. She's always been stubborn and resistant to doctors and hospitals and all of that but it's definitely been ramped up with the stroke. Tonight as I handed her her last pill of the day she literally slapped it out of my hand. I lost it a little and yelled at her and I feel bad about it. I apologized but it's hard to not feel like scum just the same.  I'm sick and tired to death of the gross side of things too. The bathroom/shower issues the lack of interest in ever getting dressed or changing clothes the poor dental hygiene and bad eating habits I mean I'm dealing with it because I want her to be clean and healthy but it's still gross and literally the last thing I hoped I would ever have to do. I'm tired of trying to force her to get up having to put up with her hissy fits about basically everything having to spend an hour coaxing her out of the house for doctor's appointments. I'm sick of the ingratitude and the childish arguing and mocking and selfishness. It is so hard sometimes to help someone who says they don't even like you. It brings out apathy in me sometimes that I'm not proud ot. I'm tired of being trapped in this house not being able to just go for a walk or do my yoga or drive out to a friend's house. I'm sick of having to arrange my entire life around her sleep schedule and feeling like I'm herding cats when I'm trying to get her out the door in any kind of timely fashion. I'm also just brimming with resentment. No one deserves a stroke or any other health condition but my mom hasn't had a GP since I was born in 1984 she smoked for decades and chugged Pepsi all day and never exercised and ate an atrociously bad diet and now I feel like I'm being punished for her bad decisions. I am certainly not the poster child for good health but at least I take my meds and go to my doctor's appointments and I try to get exercise and eat a healthy diet. Mom never even tried despite decades of myself and other family members encouraging her to do so.  The worst part about this is that I know I'm in for a long haul because she's only 65 and she will never go to a nursing home. And the thing is I wouldn't want her to because in the moments that she has clarity I want her to feel safe and in familiar surroundings at home with me.  So in summation I am trying to do my best for the woman who raised me on her own who was a great mom and who I would definitely be turning to for help right now if she weren't the one who was sick. I'm trying to not feel crushing guilt crippling anger and overwhelming stress.

Sounds difficult to live with but unless your hub sees there is a problem he s not likely to change. His self-centered parents trained him well. Have you sought counselling to help you deal with this and maybe set some boundaries? It must be very stressful for you.  ali - while living in a dysfun fam we learn many dysfun ways. Identifying the problem is the first and a big step. I am still a work in progress.  On the dd front good news. The chemo is working even after only one session. The lump is already smaller. She has her second session next week with some small alterations in dose to reduce the D and better meds so we are hopeful that she will not repeat what happened before.   I had a meltdown today - just too much going on. DD asked me to drive her next week to two appointments one at 9:30 and the other at 11 the next day. As much as I want to do everything I can to help her I have my limitations -particularly my age the CFS/FM and the fact that I am moving house in a few months and am downsizing and preparing to sell. Also the fact that since her diagnosis I have less support than usual and am being asked to give more than usual doesn't help either. I wish I could do whatever she needs me to I wish I could take this all away I wish I felt better and able to do more but I can't and I don't. I am coming out of a relapse and mornings are not my thing anyway. I called her and she understands and says whatever she asks is always framed with what I feel I can do and \"No I can't\" is fine but my mother's heart wants to do it and feels bad when I can't. On top of that were several smaller things which added to my frustration - once more the bank has something wrong a laptop died Google is misbehaving the plumber didn't come when he said he would and so on.  However this too will pass. The weather is above freezing. Yay!!!!!

{"post_id": "471606", "title": "Don\u2019t feel like doing this anymore.", "body": "I am so fed up. In many ways I am the luckiest girl alive. I have a guy who will rope the moon if I asked and does everything in the world to make me happy.And in some important ways I can\u2019t imagine anyone unluckier than me.I don\u2019t know how I ended up 49yo unable to work earlier because of two autistic kids and then after a good career now unable to work because of two 80 yo parents who decided they\u2019d like to fill the shoes my kids left empty except they\u2019re not my kids and they\u2019re not cute.Between ten specialists for dad and three for mom breaking up their fights nonstop both physical and verbal driving around hunting down an old man who keeps taking off after fights expecting I\u2019ll find him and neither of them understanding a thing doctors tell them so I have to drive them to every appointment and be there for EVERYTHING\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m going to die soon if I continue doing this.Just 2.5 years ago I moved them to me in NV from CA because my dad was on oxygen 24 hours per day and admitted to the hospital constantly due to CHF \u2014 a condition he\u2019d apparently had for ten years except he didn\u2019t understand when he was diagnosed so I didn\u2019t know for ten years until I finally went to a cardiology appointment with him. I visited often enough when I lived 7-8 hours away but only for a few days at a time because it\u2019s draining being around their fighting. I didn\u2019t even realize the depth of how he had deteriorated mentally as well.In one month I sold off their lives and listed their house and moved them closer to me because I KNEW my dad was going to die and if that happened my mom would likely dig in and refuse to move.I got them their new place found every reputable specialist in NV including getting him into the Cleveland Clinic for his neurological issues and began to manage his plethora of fatal health problems and managed their entire lives.And he got better. He got better and didn\u2019t die because Mom and I dedicated everything to getting him better despite the odds and he lived. The better he got the worse he became as a person. At least if he couldn\u2019t breathe well \u2014 he was in bed and quiet.The level of energy these two have to battle it out is unbelievable. Without going into detail I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s bad. And somewhere along the way in the last two decades these two feel they need to tell me every detail of how awful the other one is. In the last two years it\u2019s almost like they tell me just to see if I\u2019ll side with the one doing the tattling. (And in 99% of the case it\u2019s my dad who is completely wrong and beyond reasoning but only he doesn\u2019t see it.)I do more than enough.Every single thing they need I have to find and make happen. I read every one of their mail and every time my dad decides he found a better deal for his insurance or a car loan or a mortgage I\u2019m the one who has to clean it up. Their cell phones act up - call me. Their TVs don\u2019t work - call me. iPads die \u2014 call me. Got a phone call \u2014 tell the caller to call me. Drug store claims some drug isn\u2019t available \u2014 \u201ccall my daughter.\u201d It\u2019s me for everything except grocery shopping.This isn\u2019t a life. They\u2019ve taken my life hostage and my life with my guy and my dogs\u2026.it just happens when I have moments leftover.My heart beats out of my chest and my pulse is so wild you can see it in my neck. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I ended up having two stents put in due to 100% blockage and have been diagnosed with diabetes.Tonight I was just screaming and screaming at my dad after having found him walking the streets going nowhere after they duked it out when I was called to find him \u2014 and felt like something burst in my head and for a couple of hours the eyesight in my right eye had a white flash in it. I\u2019m OK now but can\u2019t catch my breath.I am falling apart and at this rate they will outlive me. I never agreed to give them my whole life.

Recovery from caregiving is still important in my daily life. I tend to isolate a lot and Covid really helped do that very effectively.

That is the passive aggressive ways of my origin family.  TS1 sent a packet yes a packet on bullying to several family members including to my mom's husband. I was caring for him and mom for four years he had general decline but still very sharp. Mom lost in the depths of dementia. TS1 was angry because I was there helping them and thought it was a result of my bullying them that I was there. Twisteds really preferred their denial at that point and thought there were no dementia problems there and TS1 never visited or assisted. She lives about 5 miles away. She was afraid of me verbally assaulting her the therapist!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  TS2 sent letters to professionals that my mom had hired over the years. The list included the CPA attorneys doctors etc. She was wanting to verify the extent of the dementia whether mom needed care what was appropriate care and the value of home care all the while telling these people what mistakes as she judged I had made in my life including my first marriage 35 years earlier even some things that went back to high school. I found out about the TS2 letter because mom's husband showed it to me. He was hurt and astounded by the accusations made against me. He and I were very close.  The TS2 letter sent to the pros was given to me by mom's husband again after it was given to him by their CPA. Again the hurt for him. I scanned and sent that to TS2 and she was angry that someone had given it to me. Of course I did not tell her where it came from.  Just a sampling of the craziness of my two twisted sisters. I haven't talked with TS1 the therapist in about five years now.  I should have posted this to the dysfunctional family thread.

Once they realize their needs are not being met maybe they will come to the realization that assisted-living is what\u2019s best for them.

When I was in my mid-40s their relationship significantly deteriorated and I had to constantly be the referee. It was a horrible position to be in. I swear I still have PTSD from the constant odd phone calls drama falls fights 911 calls. It went on for years. In my case my mom was the aggressor and my dad was beginning cognitive decline. There was also prescription drug abuse and alcohol use (not a good mix for 70 year olds). Anyway I eventually had to place my dad in memory care for his own safety. Mom refused to consider any other option (such as in-home care). It was chaos. I am an only child and there was no one else to step in. I thought my life was over.  I do believe placing my dad in memory care probably caused him to die earlier than he would have. To me the blame is on my mom for that. He died in 2019 after 3 years in the facility. Now I am stuck with her but through some good fortune I was able to get the house sold in 2020 and because of her alcohol relapses she ended up in ER/hospital/skilled nursing/assisted living. Unfortunately the physical &amp; occupational therapists have spent all of 2021 bringing her from wheelchair to rigid walker to rollator and now a cane. Last year at this time she was in a wheelchair in memory care babbling nonsense and now she is walking and wanting to live independently again.  I am not sure me or my marriage will survive another miraculous recovery on her part. I will be 55 in February. I have been stepping in and dealing with their sh*t since 2009.  I agree parents are absolutely not supposed to be like this. I never imagined either one of my parents would end up living a decade or possibly two in such a state. A middle-aged person should not have to sacrifice health career marriage happiness for unending years. This is not the way it was supposed to be. It's not like caring for a child.

Hindsight is always best. Placed in a care facility your mom would get the best from you - and look forward to seeing you - and you would get the best from your Mom. I am so sorry you quit your job. I take care of my Mom full time but I had enough years in to retire with a comfortable income. My Mom has dementia and requires almost full time care but I have my brother who always helps out and is very cognizant of what my Mom needs. What you are doing is just. too. much. for. one. person. My Aunt is my support person (she lives in Florida) took care of her husband until she had to place him in nursing home. He died from Alz and diabetes. While he was in the NH she went at lunch time to make sure he ate and then at dinner time. She never missed a day. She also went to support groups and learned a lot. She tells me every time I talk with her - Number One: Never feel bad or guilty about losing your patience or temper or what you say or yell. Number Two: You are doing the hardest job in the world. Number Three: You are doing more than what most people would do. Number Four: No one else has ANY idea how hard it is - unless they have done it too. I really know how you feel about taking care of your Mom and not putting her in a nursing home but you really do need to think/consider about prioritizing some of your needs ahead of hers - such as working and having enough to live on and for retirement. I did therapy via zoom (or something like that) with a therapist that is near-by so I could see her in person some day and I highly recommend you do the same. I am really concerned that this is going to destroy you/your life the way it is right now. I really am. I also had a thought that maybe an attorney could get the medicare etc. in place instead of you doing it. At least if attornies do this you could get a price and see if it is feasible. I pray you will be able to change your situation and make it at least some better for you.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Someone else mentioned the home health aide agencies. I got a recommendation from the SW or CM at the hospital from mum's last admission. I went with Visiting Angels because they had a local office in my parents town and when I called a real live person answered the phone. When I left a VM a real live person the same one multiple times called me back. They have have been great. Yes we got very lucky with an excellent aide who had capacity to take us on as a regular. If this is what you want make this known from the beginning with the agency. We have 3 times per week aide the same one every time for 3 hours a day. She mops the high use areas cleans the bathroom heats the food and makes sandwiches for supper washes the dishes and does the laundry takes out trash and provides them with some outside company and conversation. It is working out very well. She will go buy groceries if needed or pick up take away food too. The cost is less than $30/hr and if your mother has funds it is money well spent. You have to be involved at first. I was in the home when they started I wrote out check lists bought the cleaning supplies and stocked the bathroom and kitchen etc. But once you get a reliable aide with common sense and some experience after a couple of weeks of check lists its smooth sailing. I would Highly recommend them. But do be there when the aides first start coming so you can show them what is expected where things are and give them the low down on the parent - the good the bad and what you really need and expect. So they are not doing things you dont value and you are not always looking over their shoulder. Every day won't be perfect a couple times I found the trash was not taken out or the cat box was not scooped but 90% of the time its been great. We had only one who just came in sat on the sofa and played on her phone while my dad watched TV and talked to himself. (I walked in on this) But she was just a fill in for one day. The regular aides have been great and if/when they can't show the agency calls me direct and they will staff it with someone if at all possible. And as needs increase we can increase the coverage so they can stay in their home as long as possible. And if the aide cancels or quits the agency finds a replacement to staff your needs.

As someone who is in a similar circumstance my first thought is to take care of your own health first. Immediately actually. I'm concerned about your eyes. Hire whatever help they need now so you can focus on yourself. Then when you're feeling better you can sit down and make a plan on how to best move forward.   I don't know your situation but things didn't improve for me until I told my siblings that I quit. We started working together as a family after that meltdown. It's amazing what can be accomplished if you have help and support from family. If not hire the help and support.  During a discussion we had with an elder care attorney she told us about someone she had on staff. I can't remember the woman's title but the employee would go into the home and evaluate the loved one and then make recommendations for care. She was like a geriatric social worker.   My husband and I have been held hostage for so many years I'm embarrassed to say because neither of us had the gumption to stand up for ourselves. As a result we've been caregivers for the three parents between us without help from family. Now I say \"Two down one to go.\" Dark humor forgive me. We've learned a lot in the past year and are doing much better but we still have challenging days.

I can't say I like some of the solutions I ended up with but they did solve some of the problems while still retaining relationships - sis excepted. In her case the solution was definitely to go no contact and I am at peace with it. Would I rather have had a sister I could relate to? Of course! But drastic situations require drastic solutions often. My mental health is important to me.  I don't aim at being happy al the time. For me that is not a viable solution to anything. I aim at being real being content being at peace within even when there is not peace without. If that requires distance from toxic people so be it.

{"post_id": "471281", "title": "Update to financial impacts of disease treatments...", "body": "A lot has happened since I last posted. My husband's. Neurologist started the wheels in motion for him to begin Onpattro I fusions. Working with a case worker from the drug manufacturer and the infusion center where he will receive treatments we found ou that 80% of the treatment costs will becovered by Medicare. Our supplemental insurance will cover the remaining 20%. There was a slight delay in the approval process. Those of you living outside of the U.S. most likely will shake your heads in disbelief but in the United States our health insurance payment system is totally dependent upon codes that insurance companies assign to various procedures and treatments. Hospitals and clinics may also use codes...but they are usually internal to their operations and differ from those of the insurance companies. And then there is the added complication that hospitals clinics and treatment centers may have separate agreements with insurance companies that place them in selective discount tiers that allow them to adjust payment fees for differing institutions. When a doctor writes an order for a treatment they must be sure to specify the appropriate billing code used by whatever insurance company covers the patient. Many people are employed to keep track of all of this. In our case the neurologist correctly identified the appropriate billing code on the initial order. We were told however that a subsequent note that was sent to the infusion center contained a different code. With all the hands that touch the communications it took a while to identify who had seen the first code who had seen the conflicting codes who needed to contact the neurologist to make the correction and then find out where in the process the first information needed to be canceled so the correct code was used. (Yes we definitely need to overhaul our healthcare system.) Husband will receive his first Onpattro infusion today. We also were referred to a cardiologist to determine if husband's heart is involved. We met with cardiologist last week. We found that in Colorado where we live there are not many doctors with experience diagnosing or treating amyloidosis. This cardiologist referred by our primary care physician has some training both from his residency and a short internship with an amyloidosis specialist. Because husband already had the genetic confirmation of the Val30Met gene mutation the cardiologist limited his initial visit to an EKG and vitals. He advised the test that would reveal cardiac amyloid deposition is a PYP scan. A radioactive injection that when exposed to another scan causes amyloid deposits to glow thus confirming presence in the heart. This test is scheduled for early January.  mMeanwhile my husband's symptoms have worsened. His weakness and fatigue keep him chair-bound and napping throughout the day. If he does something like taking out the trash his breathing is labored and he must rest afterward..When he eats he feels full very quickly. He is eating barely half of what he was two months ago And continues to lose weight. In the past two days he has noticed considerable loss of strength in his left leg from his knee to his foot. He fell the day before yesterday after trying to bend forward to pick up something. He was not injured. But he did reveal that this was not the first time he has fallen. (News to me.) The falls the weakness the reduction in eating all tell me that disease is progressing rapidly. The infusion can't come soon enough.  I will share how the infusion goes and how he tolerates the treatment.

She moved to assisted living two months ago where she is thriving: eating well making friends sleeping better etc. To get her to willingly pull the trigger we had to allow her to take her car.  A couple of weeks in she approached the administrator shopping list in hand and asked for directions to the grocery store. Since this isn't his first rodeo he redirected her - successfully he thought. She seemed happy with his suggestions (let us call you an Uber we have a shopping trip scheduled Friday and you could go then etc.) and went back upstairs to her room. Then during the 2 pm staff change meeting when nobody was looking out the door she went and she drove away. She didn't have her phone of course.  Eight hours later and well after dark (she hasn't driven after dark in years) the police were just about to put a vulnerable adult alert out on Twitter with photos of her and the car. My husband was on the phone with adult child #2 filling him in (we didn't want him to find out when his friends said hey isn't that your grandma on Twitter?) when her residence called to say she had breezed back in thanks to a Good Samaritan who had guided her back from the grocery store. Where else she had been she can't say.  The next day I \"stole\" her car. It is in the garage in her house which she still owns.

They will have a lot of options and ideas about caring for your mom including how to get in home care for her. Red tape in applying for Social Security etc simply is and you can\u2019t escape it. Once it\u2019s done life will be better. It\u2019s overwhelming because it\u2019s crazy making and you\u2019re drowning in so many other tasks and emotions as a caregiver for someone who is angry and difficult.   Never say never about a nursing home. Don\u2019t bring it up at this point. If it comes to it search through Medicare website to find the very best one you can. Visit her a lot. When a facility knows family comes a lot and is involved the care can be better because they know there\u2019s another set of eyes on the loved one.   If you don\u2019t have it already do get Power of Attorney. Your life will be so much easier. You\u2019ll be so glad you did when dealing with doctors etc. The way I put it to my brother was \u201cYou know how I\u2019m doing all this stuff for you? I need you to sign this giving me permission to take care of this for you in case someone asks\u201d.

Do you have an adult daycare in your area she could go a couple of days a week. Is there anyone in your family who could give some time so you could get out.

I'm 39 and like you I was extremely overwhelmed in the beginning of my caregiving journey. My mom passed last month and the finality of her being gone is a tough adjustment; but I would have continued my sacrifice just to have her here. I don't know if you believe in something higher than yourself but I advise that you pray and turn to the word whenever you are feeling stressed resentful angry etc etc. I also advise trying to seek counseling/therapy to help with coping mechanisms while this journey lasts. I had no counsel in the beginning and I was my only help. I cared for my mom from roughly 18-39 years of age and that story in itself is something made for a movie which I won't divulge right now as I'm trying to be brief. In addition to what most of your supporters have mentioned regarding seeking someone to give u a break every week or so if it's financially possible or applying for Medicaid so she can have home health aides with her during the day while you tend to your needs you must also focus on your health and well being. We are consumed when caring for our loved ones that we tend to neglect ourselves. I have had way too much experience with hospitals rehab facilities etc etc. The healthcare system is broken and changes must be made. If your parent requires 24/7 care and help the countless facilities I have experienced will cause a decline in their health. Thank God for his blessings over my strength and patience as I was there from sun up to sundown once I realized the care given is not present so I was pretty much an unpaid worker whenever she was hospitalized or in a facility. Places lack the number of staff needed to help and nurses are overwhelmed with too many patients and when you witness this for over 2 decades it's heartbreaking and the quality of care is nonexistent. If ever you need to talk about the nitty gritty when it pertains to ALL THINGS related to caregiving please reach out. I tended to all my mom's countless needs and as time progressed more issues arose so I was in charge of medication administration feeding tube care tracheostomy care you name it....I was even taught how to give her antibiotics via her pic line at home. I have learned so much that I would not mind sharing with you or anyone else for that matter. Please pray and try your best to love her through her illness.

Your dad's vascular dementia causes him to be unable to control his behaviors or recognize that there are issues. https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/types-of-dementia/vascular-dementia Still that doesn't help keep you sane. Neither you or your mother will win a argument when trying to reason with someone with dementia. His ability to reason is long gone as is the executive ability required to manage his life. Some of what is occurring is because he is no longer mentally competent to initiate actions or control himself. Given the constant fighting and the post-fight wandering your dad might need to be in a memory care or even a nursing home given his overall poor health. At best you'd need to get his aggressive behaviors medically managed by having an honest conversation about them with his physician/neuropsych and then have in-home help for them but that's really not going to be optimal and it doesn't sound healthy for your mom either.

This has been a very valuable discussion for me as I'm sure for the original poster. My Mom is turning the corner on being 88 and just beginning to exhibit some memory issues and has incontinence issues. She's in excellent health otherwise. I've gotten her health POA and permissions to discuss her care with her GP Medicare etc. She agreed to do this so that I wouldn't have to deal with all that should she get sick. She lives by herself in a house built by her and my Dad. I moved long distance to live near her 6 years ago when my Dad passed away. My husband and I do lots of little things for her and we're happy to do it however she's beginning to let the house fall into disrepair. I had to have a talk with her to let her know that if she wanted to stay in her house she would need to get things fixed. She is financially well off so money is not the issue. I think she gets overwhelmed when there are too many things to take care of so she just ignores some things. I found a handyman to begin repairing and replacing some of the important things like getting one of her door locks replaced because it was broken. She reasons things away like this by saying she lives in a gated community and no one would be able to get in. Ugh! Her front door locks were oxidized and the key would no longer work so those are being replaced too. When I tried recently to get her to have other things fixed she said it was too much too fast. Big argument there so I let it go. I'm going to try again after Thanksgiving. Her memory issues worsened over the summer. It comes and goes. We live in an area where people live here 6 months out of the year (we call them snowbirds). Her friends are returning and she's as happy as a clam. She's been hacked three times and I worry that it's only a matter of time before it happens again and harm is done. (thankfully I caught all three in progress and averted the worst).  Problems with long and\u00a0short-term memory:\u00a0 1. forgetting that's she's already asked the a\u00a0question just\u00a05 minutes later repeats herself. Seems to come and go.\u00a0 2.Often reintroduces me to those I've known for several years. 3.Showed up a day early to pick up friends for dinner another day an hour early.\u00a0 4. Forgets that she's ordered something online or orders an excess of items.  5. Has several piles of mail around the house.  6. Can't keep up with her emails (I have access to that and clean out the spam for her)  7. It's hard for her to make phone calls for\u00a0things that need\u00a0taken care of or fixed. Gets confused as to who's who with vendors. 8. She has items that should have been returned a year ago sitting on her desk.  The list goes on and on. I try hard to help her with all of it but she's resistant and stubborn. The caregiving has barely begun and I'm already frustrated and angry. Thank you all for the advice!

I found in the 20 months she lived with me I was not a Caregiver. The unpredictability of the disease was one thing. I like organization and at 65 hard to change that. And doing the intimate things for her bothered me. I was going to place her a week in an AL to go to a nieces wedding. Turned out they were having a half price sale on room and board so I jumped on it. Eventually it was LTC. By that time her care went beyond what I was physically capable of doing. Yes there maybe some things I could maybe feel guilty about but I refuse to. Because good or bad I was the one that was there for her.   So if you feel you can't do it don't.

To me its not so much \"misinformation\" as being \"misinformed\".   I will use Hospice as an example. How many times on this forum do we hear that Hospice killed a LO. That they would not let them eat gave them too much morphine. The problem I see here is that this person is either not involved in the constant care or Hospice is not giving family informed info. We all know feeding is stopped because the body is shutting down and feeding does more harm than good. I think its hard for some to get their head around that Hospice means the end. So they are looking for any excuse to why the LO died. They died because whatever health problem they had caused their death. If not today someday.  Now I am not saying there are not poorly run Hospice and and care facilities. You need to be an Advocate for your LO. Ask questions and question. You have a right to fire a Hospice and transfer to another care facility. My Mom was in LTC. I have recommended this place. Another person says they had a bad experience with the place.   Misinformation when it comes to what is going on in the world no one really knows what is right or wrong.

I am so glad you returned to write us a \"for instance\".  I don't think it is fear mongering to say what a difficult thing it is for care facilities to accept clients who are having a difficult time with acting out. It must be recognized by all not just by old nurses like me that a facility that houses many elders in memory care units usually elders as roommates for one another with access to others has a difficult time with elders who are a danger to others physically or emotionally or cause fear for others. When this happens any good facility attempts to work with families and with doctors to come up with medications that will help. And yes therein lies the problem of finding a drug or a drug cocktail that WORKS. That is one that will calm the elder sooth the elder so that they can be more content BUT keeps the elder from going into a zombie-like state where they do not eat do not interact and are in danger of poor balance and falls. \"Zombie-like\" may be an unfortunate choice of wording but I admit to having used it because it does paint a picture. A picture I have unfortunately been witness to. Gives people an idea of what is to be avoided. It is a terrible question what to do in these instances. A question without a good answer in some circumstances despite a whole slough of medications available. It is hit or miss wait and see try and try again for the doctors who aren't there to assess affects and side effects.  This is a RARE circumstance; Most of our elders suffering from dementia don't have these problems. But being on forum for any amount of time we will find out that it does happen is a problem and is one that is difficult to address. Discussing all of this honestly and openly on Forum does no one any harm. It isn't fear mongering; any of us already HAS fear on board when we try to act in the best interests of our elders who cannot act for themselves anymore. Accusations of facilities not caring of their drugging patients into oblivion etc IS/would be harmful. I personally haven't seen that but I could have missed it. It is my feeling that most who work with elders love doing it; it is almost a vocation. The last thing they want is to participate in or witness abuse of an elder. But that's just my own experience as a nurse and as a person whose loved one was in a wonderful ALF. I am glad we came to what is certainly an issue if not THE issue for you. We can better discuss it than when we use nebulous words like \"fear-mongering\".

Could I have ignored him for longer? Sure \u2014 but to what end? So he won\u2019t go to the appointments I worked my butt off to get for him and we miss something and he dies?   This level of care is why we\u2019ve discovered a subdural hematoma; a GIST tumor in his stomach that we had removed; a gall bladder mass that ended up being gall bladder cancer (also removed); a blockage in his carotid artery that now requires a vascular surgeon because an angioplasty was impossible; a mini stroke recently that now requires more neurology visits and that\u2019s in addition to his CHF vascular dementia stage 3 kidney disease COPD and more. It\u2019s really hard for me to treat him normally when he is clearly not \u201cnormal\u201d not that he was ever a \u201cnice guy\u201d before these problems.  I can rationally accept that the advice you\u2019re giving is sound given the circumstances. I\u2019ve advised as much to other people. I just have no way in my temperament or upbringing to implement any of it in my own life and live with myself.

I'm at an age where I absolutely can't quit my job to take care of anyone. My retirement would be ruined. My mom was driving me crazy and I didn't even live with her. She also has a strong personality and refuses everything like a toddler.   I recently put her into a memory care facility. Not every facility is perfect but a lot of these places don't look like the traditional nursing home. My mom has her own apartment and the place looks like a hotel. I would try visiting a few places to get a feel for them yourself. My mom would still prefer to be in her own home but I have peace of mind knowing that she is safe. I felt really guilty for about a month but it really is better for both of us. Even some of her friends have visited and they can see that she hasn't been dumped in some awful place.

She was 85 yrs old when she came here to live in a home just 2 doors away from me. She just gave me the power to take over all her finances and keep the orderly running of her home. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. She was up and down in her health and my life became doctor visits taking her out to places she would enjoy and food shopping for her. I lost my own life completely. If the electric went out during a storm I worried. If we had a blizzard and couldn\u2019t get out I worried. Every minute of every day was thinking about her her bills that needed to be paid her medication refills her congestive heart failure problems her growing breast cancer her taking a shower just everything that a person needs in order to live comfortably. She was able to do so because I gave up everything for her. And I did resent her. She would not have done that for me. Now that she is passed - at age 95 (this past summer) I feel relieved but I am still stuck. I urge you to think about a facility that can care for her at her level of care. This is a situation that will eat you alive. I developed Non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 5 yrs into my caretaking and I know it was due to stress the first years of caring for her. I am still treating. I don\u2019t know how long I have as I am stage 3b and there are only 4 stages. My body could not take the stress of actually taking over someone else\u2019s life. I kept a diary of sorts for the first few years and when I read back on it I don\u2019t know how I did it. It was a terrible time for me. My mother had it good but I did not. Please consider doing the next best thing and do not feel guilty. You deserve your life and she will have hers. She may not like it in the beginning but don\u2019t let that sway you. You will be fine and she will even have friends meals showers etc. in her new home. And you can visit her and be her daughter again. Do it.

You are finding this hard because it is the hardest job anyone will ever do. Medicare should cover an aid 3 times a week to help with bathing and dressing.

{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Might I make a few observations and suggestions.  1 - Your mom's care will be overwhelming if you are the only person caring for her 24/7/365. Burnout is inevitable if you do not get enough \"time off\" to meet your own health needs and social needs.  2 - While I admire your dedication to your mom and her care you are neglecting your own retirement. You need to secure your own financial state first and being with mom second. Nobody can secure your finances or retirement but you.  3 - Everything seems overwhelming. You need to sort out the issues and create a plan. Meeting with a social worker and a counsellor - even televideo meetings can help. The social worker can help you locate and access all the resources available for your situation. A counsellor can help you sort out the emotional overload and create a healthy plan for dealing with your mom.  4 - There are lots of ways that you can work get enough time off and help care for mom. You can not care for her 24/7/365 alone.   a - Ask for help from family friends community of faith and paid help. Some folks will be OK with sitting your mom for a few hours weekly. Others may be able to help with household tasks: housekeeping meals yardwork running errands...  b - if you can not get enough help to care for mom at home then it is time to look at outside resources. Adult Day Care is a Monday through Friday daytime option; they care for mom in a nursing home of private home while you work. Home health aides can also watch mom in your home while you work. Assisted living usually consists of having a private room or suite with home health aides that assist throughout the day. Full care is for those that need frequent care by others. Check to see if mom's insurance and finances will cover any of these services.   c - If mom doesn't have enough finances help her apply for Medicaid. Help her also apply for Medicare and any other public help. You can make an appointment with Social Service. It might help to review their websites and gather all documents needed. If your mom ends up in the hospital again ask social services to help you with these tasks.   d - If mom needs to use Medicaid for help she may be best served in a residential facility that takes Medicaid clients.   A good daughter or son makes sure that their parents are cared for... even if it means you can not do the hands-on care yourself.", "date": "2021-11-18 09:56:23", "user_name": "Taarna", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/im-new-to-caregiving-and-trying-not-to-drown-in-it-471198.htm"},
{"post_id": "471198", "title": "I'm new to caregiving and trying not to drown in it.", "body": "Oh goodness. I saw this in my email inbox and I knew that I had to come by and say something. My mom passed away last year. I am 39 years old. And I took care of my mom for 13 years. My mom was 75 much older than your mom but I took care of her from age 25-38. After my dad passed away I was her caregiver.   Listen sweetie. I said the same things as you about how I would never put her in a nursing home and how she didn't want to go anyway.   I miss my mom so much. I burst out crying yesterday because a memory came to me so vividly about her. But there is so much CLARITY now that she is gone. I love her to pieces but she would have been so much better off if at the age of 25 I put her in assistant living. Because at the time she was at least able to walk with a walker and in the beginning I only did things like laundry and cooking and standby assistance for showers. Gradually she got worse took a few falls messed up her back. Became bedridden during the last 6 years of her life.   I was her ONLY caregiver. She did have CNAs coming to bathe her 3 times a week which was helpful but even with that it was a burden. (Ask the doctor to order you this if she has Medicare she should be able to get CNAs to come bathe her). My mom was a fiery woman used to be very independent and always got her way. Very sweet though. She wasn't horrible I'm just saying she was a woman that knew what she wanted. It was... HARD. My brothers off in other states with their family. We had no family here. It was just me. I managed bills her pills her dressing Hoyer Lifts taking her to doctors appointments her dentures her voiding and bowel movements. The whole nine.   I still sometimes here a sound (probably my neighbors) that makes me think its her and I have an urge to jump up and run to see if she needs help. The PTSD-like crap will get to you. I don't even know if it's PTSD. It's something.   Look. I joined a gym and MADE time for myself when I was taking care of my mom. You have to. You HAVE to go on a walk or do yoga. You matter too.   But anyway.... I was saying before... that I have such clarity now. I would have done everything differently. And one thing that I learned... no matter how much your mom says she doesn't want to go to a nursing home the fact is she's just scared. Deep down any sensible human would choose a nursing home over putting burden on someone they love. But she isn't sensible. She's knocking pills out of your hand and she has had strokes. She's sick. So she can't think logically about the matter but you can.   You'd be able to visit your mom in a nursing home even take her out shopping or out to lunch sometimes come by and visit her and tell her about a new guy or job in your life. About your new yoga class. Have photos for her to look at. Grandkids for her to visit with. All these things I wish I could have done with my mom but can't because I never gave myself a life.

What I do dislike is anger and vitriol against someone who doesn't believe what we believe. I think some few (very RARE) posters are into us doing the \"Social Media Bout\" here on Forum. Or into \"changing hearts and minds\"; I don't like to see a question by some innocent OP turned into 132 answers overnight of a few on Forum who got drawn into arguing with one another trying to prove our own points while the OP disappears under the waves. Realistically I guess this IS social media so I should just \"leave it\" as we say to the dogs. What is it the young kids say today? \"It's all good\"? (I could argue THAT one. I think we are all adults. We're capable of making our own decisions for our own lives of giving our own opinions to OPs who ask for them. Then let the OP sort out what is of value to him or her personally and leave the rest. We have a lot of regulars on Forum. I think we are all good people. I think we would all help one another if we were neighbors.  For the most part I don't think that the admins should intervene. If someone is expressing suicidal ideation they should if someone is threatening others they should make a decision; or if someone is spreading blatant dangerous misinformation (as opposed to opinion) they have to look it over.  So if a post is in some way dangerous in your opinion click on the report button and let the admins decide. I trust them to do so. And do this RARELY; they have a life! As to differences of opinion?? We often don't even agree in our own families; why would be think we can agree on Forum? The OPs I think are for the most part very capable of separating the chaff from the wheat for their own specific cases. And so often we dispense really GOOD information that can make a difference for people. Perhaps sometimes we are baited because folks just love to watch a bar fight and the latest season of Ozark is already gobbled up.  I guess we just have to make our own choice once again. Jump in or leave it. I do agree with cwillie that it would be nice if the admins stepped in when a thread goes South to either move it to discussions or to stop comment. My fear is that because we find out someone doesn't vote for OUR guy (or gal) we will decide their opinion doesn't count; NOT good.

Because the web is full of it literally and figuratively. Does a handful of people really cause you that much fear? Do you not see that it is countered with others opinions?  Personally I want BOTH sides of a narrative with which to make my own personal decisions with. I think we are all okay mostly all reasoning adults and know that our caregiving experience makes us anything but objective on the subject.  I also know that people are going to do whatever they are going to do no matter what anyone here says. Maybe just maybe they will ask better questions and take closer looks at what is happening because of the differing stances.  It is okay to disagree about anything that's what being autonomous is about personal function. It is up to every person on the planet to gather information and use it according to their own particular situation. If we can't do that we are screwed as a people.   I for one don't want or need someone else spoon feeding me what THEY think I need to know. Don't we get enough of that in the media?

Doing everything for them is not a big issue for me though sometimes I find it irritating.   There are two distinct parts I just cannot stand.  (1) It\u2019s the dynamics of their awful angry relationship that affects me. It\u2019s just unbelievable to me that at 80 years of life with death up right ahead knowing one of them may not wake up tomorrow and that would not be surprising \u2014 this is how they want to spend what could be their last day of life. How sad for them\u2026and how pitiful for me to watch it firsthand.  (2) My dad is just mentally unfit. He\u2019s a well-educated MBA man who worked to the high ranks at a US conglomerate before retiring and he\u2019s deteriorated to making no sense and can\u2019t process what he hears be it in English or Korean. Can\u2019t hear that well and what he does hear he can\u2019t process. (They\u2019re concluding its vascular dementia but specifically not Alzheimer\u2019s which has been ruled out.) And everyone can see it EXCEPT HIM. He\u2019ll still actually tell me he knows better or he doesn\u2019t need the likes of me etc. unaware he can\u2019t do anything for himself.  Worse he creates more work for me having to undo these ridiculous scams he falls for \u2014 Cheaper Medicare! Better refinancing rates! Save money with solar! Free HBO! \u2014 and so forth. All the calls and paperwork I have to do for them doesn\u2019t anger me but when he MAKES trouble\u2026 I just get enraged. And he\u2019s not even apologetic; he says \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Call and cancel it and stop acting like you\u2019re doing something extraordinary!\u201d  Everything else meh \u2014 I\u2019ll live.

I take them out to social activities they like and my husband is a good sport about going with us. When they have to drive a ways to meet friends and it\u2019s nighttime we drive them there and find something to do for five hours so they can have fun. They need only get dressed and wait for me on the days we have appointments and attend; they don\u2019t need to listen to one thing the doctors say or follow up with a single item \u2014 I do it all. Literally all they have to do is not create chaos and I\u2019m willing to go to the ends of the earth to make their last years easy for them but it\u2019s like they\u2019re hellbent on sending me off first!

{"post_id": "471606", "title": "Don\u2019t feel like doing this anymore.", "body": "@countrymouse you are correct. The situation I am in was indeed my choice and my decision. I moved them here because it was clear they couldn\u2019t manage their care anymore. Be it a sick dad or sick mom I can\u2019t live with the fact that either died without my having done all I could.   Contrary to what I make it sound like in my original post (1) they were not bad parents to me growing up all things considered; and (2) I actually don\u2019t regret moving them here to manage their care. Even doing everything for them is not altogether torture for me in that giving them a few full-time years of my life to ensure a comfortable ending is still worthwhile to me. I\u2019m lucky to be able to do that. I know that.  It\u2019s that they hate each other and live off this drama that kills me. It\u2019s that they have zero qualms about involving me in this drama of theirs letting \u2014 no demanding and forcing \u2014 their daughter witness the ugliness and misery they cause each other at the end of their lives that just\u2026rots me. It\u2019s truly like a black mold that just spreads and I hate it. That is what I feel \u201cparents\u201d shouldn\u2019t do. I hate that my parents do this and I hate that I let it get this close to us.   I have asked and begged to be left out of it. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t care that my dad took off again or that they had a blowout fight but I do not want to be involved in that part. I don\u2019t want to know and if they can\u2019t handle their own tempers to ensure they live peacefully they should deal with the repercussions of that on their own too. I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m savage and callous - but they don\u2019t understand I really cannot operate like this.  I\u2019ve explained that my life and my relationship with my husband are so peaceful and zen BY CHOICE and that I can\u2019t deal with the constant animosity they bring into it. It causes chaos in my own household (because it affects me) and it causes me embarrassment that my parents are living out the end of their lives like this. My sister and I live petrified that I will turn out like this.  Because this part comes with the other parts I willingly manage and like you said it was my decision when I knew their relationship was not great when I moved them here (since they involved me in that part then too though in my defense I had no idea to what extent or frequency this happened!) I do regret my decision\u2026.now.

{"post_id": "472935", "title": "Where does the fear mongering stem from on this forum?", "body": "Fear mongering stems from strong opinions. And you know what's said about opinions. I personally like to listen to those who have first hand experience with the advice they impart vs. offering sheer opinion based on here say. \"My sister's ex husband's best friend worked in a nursing home and said she saw the residents tied up in wheelchairs in the hallways\" vs. \"My mother has lived in a good skilled nursing facility for 3 years where the quality of care I've seen her receive is top notch.\" Yet the naysayers will insist those of us with first hand experience are blind &amp; ignorant liars etc and have thrown our mothers out like garbage while they have self flagellated and bled themselves with leeches to provide 24/7 in home care the last 18 years single handedly. Never ever having administered as much as a Tylenol when the parent was screaming bloody murder and biting their faces with advanced dementia.   Nobody wants censorship here because freedom of speech should be encouraged along with open discussion. Only when the ugly debate gets to name calling and personal attacks do the posts get reported and the admins sometimes step in to referee or stop further comments or delete comments entirely. I've seen that happen here quite often too.  I guess the moral of the story is to take what you like &amp; ignore the rest. And beat a hasty retreat when the heartburn gets to be too much.", "date": "2022-02-09 00:46:43", "user_name": "lealonnie1", "reply": true, "keywords": [], "url": "https://www.agingcare.com/discussions/where-does-the-fear-mongering-stem-from-on-this-forum-472935.htm"},
